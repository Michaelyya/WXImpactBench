"18840527","S kindly assisted in the classification of the bones. In dealing with his subject, Dr. Dawson remarked that great interest attaches to any remains which, in countries historically so old, may indicate the residence of man before the dawn of history. In Egypt, nodules of flint are very abundant in the Eocene limestones, and where these have been wasted away, remain on the surface. In many places there is good evidence that the flint thus to be found everywhere has been, and still is, used for the manufacture of flukes, knives, and other implements. These, as is well known, were used for many purposes by the ancient Egyptians, and in modern times gun-flints and strike-lights still continue to be made. The debris of worked flints found on the surface is thus of little value as an indication of any flint-folk preceding the old Egyptians. It would be otherwise if flint implements could be found in the older gravels of the country. Some of these are of Pleistocene age, and belong to a period of partial submergence of the Nile Valley. Flint implements had been alleged to be found in those gravels, but there seemed to be no good evidence to prove that they are other than the chips broken by mechanical violence in the removal of the gravel by torrential action. In the Lebanon, numerous caverns exist. These were divided into two classes, with reference to their origin; some being water-caves or tunnels of subterranean rivers, others sea-caves, excavated by the waves when the country was at a lower level than at present. Both kinds have been occupied by man, and some of them undoubtedly at a time anterior to the Phoenician occupation of the country, and even at a time when the animal inhabitants and geographical features of the region were different from those of the present day. They were thus of various ages, ranging from the post-Glacial or Antediluvian period to the time of the Phoenician occupation. Dr. Dawson then remarked that many geologists in these days had an aversion to using the word ""Antediluvian,"" on account of the nature of the work which, in years now gone by, unlearned people had attributed to the flood described in Scripture, but as the aversion to the use of that word was, he thought, not called for in these days, he hoped it would pass away. Speaking as a geologist, from a purely geological point of view, and from a thorough examination of the country around, there was no doubt that there was conclusive evidence that between the time of the first occupation of these caves by men—and they were men of a splendid physique—and the appearance of the early Phoenician inhabitants of the land, there had been a vast submergence of land, and a great catastrophe, aye a stupendous one, in which even the Mediterranean had been altered from a small sea to its present size. In illustration of this, the caverns at the Pass of Nahr-el-Kelb and at Ant Elias were described in some detail, and also, in connection with these, the occurrence of flint implements on the surface of modern sandstones at the Cape of Has near Beirut; these last were probably of much less antiquity than those of the more ancient caverns. A discussion ensued, which was taken part in by a number of distinguished Fellows of the Royal Society, including Sir H. Barkly, F."

"18941218","U1ASCE AND MADAGASCAR The French have taken the first step towards spending the recent vote of $12,500,000 by occupying Tamatave, and no doubt the news will be received at Paris with great enthusiasm, though this is only the first and simplest step in the undertaking. Evidently the whole nation has been smitten by the war fever. The legislative bodies could not withstand the pressure of popular excitement and passed the vote by large majorities. In their heart of hearts many members of the Senate and the Chamber probably know better, and would vote against the expedition if they dared. But France has got herself into such a position with regard to Madagascar that she must either go on or withdraw, and in the present state of public feeling withdrawal is impossible. What France is to gain by the expedition is not clear; and the loss she risks is not merely of money and soldiers' lives, but of national honor. No doubt France can crush Madagascar if she puts forth her energies, but the operation may be a very expensive one. The Hovas are said to have a reserve of 70,000 men, well supplied with rifles and modern artillery. The difficulty of the expedition is greatly increased by the nature of the country. Of the road from Tamatave to the capital, an English resident in Madagascar says: Speaking generally the route is an endless succession of hills. Here and there are short easy stages, but for the greater part the French troops will have to cut their way, two or three abreast at the most, in the beds of gullies made by the torrential rains. At other points they will have to cut their way through dense, fever-laden forest. Even with small parties it often happens that the porters have literally to drag one another out of the thick, red mud in which they sink to their waist. From the top of the hills and rocks a mere handful of Hovas could, without danger to themselves, seriously harass the troops toiling hundreds of feet below them. It is evident that the French force, which is to consist of 15,000 troops in the first instance, will have no easy task before them. If the Hovas have anything like the military discipline and modern weapons they are given credit for, they will offer a serious resistance, and it may be that the French will meet a more destructive foe in the malarial fever. Even if the Hovas give way and the expedition proves a success, what return is the French government likely to get for its expenditure? The island is said to be unsuitable for European colonization, and if it offered a good field, the French would not colonize it. The population of France is practically at a standstill, and the government has no need to seek room for expansion. It does so merely from a foolish national jealousy of England, whose small size and overflowing population make colonization and colonial trade an absolute necessity. The French of today have neither the circumstances nor the characteristics which impel young Englishmen to emigrate. The young Frenchman is happy at home; he thinks France the finest country in the world, and he looks upon emigration as exile. Before national feeling had reached its present fever heat, the oro spoke out plainly: France will never colonize Madagascar, and nobody wants it but those to whom the island will be the happy hunting-ground of functionaries, of exotic banks, and of railways without passengers or traffic. This is what will happen if all goes well; but if disaster comes, the story of Tonquin will be repeated, and the Government which is now keeping in power by yielding to the popular voice will be swept out of office amid universal execration. The news of the unexpected death of Robert Louis Stevenson will bring to many of his admirers the pain of a personal loss. His genial, beautiful, cheerful spirit endeared him to thousands who knew him, and in the passing away of such a gentle spirit English literature sustains a loss we can ill afford. Stevenson had none of the pessimism and cynicism which mark some of our modern novelists. He was thoroughly human, and it is his entire humanity that gives his stories their greatest charm. It is because of this quality that we follow with breathless interest the adventures of his freebooters and wild Highland men and simple Lowland youths or English sailor boys. He had also in high degree the gift of romantic imagination. For the first time in English literature he united the pictureness of Scott with the exactness of Defoe. Careful workmanship and distinction of style made his books as delightful to the literary critic as to the schoolboy. No greater boon can be given to the young people than to make them acquainted with his stirring tales and charming essays. The next move against the liquor trade in this province is to be for the purpose of separating the sale of intoxicants from that of other articles of merchandise. The host of petitions presented in the Legislature yesterday is evidently the reconnaissance in force that is intended to precede the real attack. There are such reasons in favor of the change asked for that it has been adopted in many places. The temperance element has been having so much to say in shaping the laws here of late, too, that it is not unlikely that Quebec may before long be among them. There will be a great outcry from the Lancashire cotton spinners at the renewal of the proposal to levy a tax on cotton imports into India; but so long as the theory is held that India is governed for her own benefit and not for the advantage of England, one does not see how for the sake of English interests the administrators of Indian affairs can be restrained from doing what they say is absolutely necessary for India's welfare. At the same time, it is a severe blow to the Manchester school of free trade delivered in their tenderest spot: their pockets. Sir Charles H. Tupper appears by the reports to have been subjected to a good many interruptions at some of his British Columbia meetings. Liberals, when they feel they are getting the worst of the situation, have a weakness for resorting to such tactics. One of the worst interrupted meetings ever held in Canada was that in the Montreal drill shed, called by the Conservatives, just previous to the overthrow of the provincial Liberals in 1892. Before it Montreal had two Conservatives in the Legislature; after it she had six. The conduct of the Toronto Street Railway Co. in employing detectives to watch the judge and counsel conducting the boodling investigation is, to say the least of it, most extraordinary. When suspected persons employ detectives to investigate the private lives of the magistracy it is getting things down pretty fine, and a boodler has been correctly defined by a Montreal judge as the meanest kind of thief. Mr. Gigault's report on the success of the dairy industry in Denmark shows that Canada has yet abundant room for expansion in that direction. Close attention to the peculiarities of the English market is the first condition of success, and on this head the report contains suggestions to which Quebec farmers will do well to give heed. A vessel from Canada has been refused a permit to land cattle at Antwerp because of the prevalence of foot and mouth disease in this country. Either the cable has made a mistake or the man who gave the order did. The Belgian authorities seem to be imitating the British in crediting Canada with faults it does not possess. Another British warship is on its way to China. There must be quite a powerful British fleet now watching the progress of events at the principal Chinese ports. If Great Britain should feel called upon to interfere with the contestants, she would be able to intervene to some purpose."
"18960728","BRITISH LIVE STOCK Cooler Weather Brings Better Prices for Cattle BUT MARKET STILL LOW Details of the Market - Only Three to Three and a Half Cents Paid in Canada Can Make Money (From our own Correspondent) Liverpool, July 18 After fourteen days' dreadfully hot weather, a complete change in the atmospheric conditions now prevails almost generally throughout the Kingdom, and instead of sweltering under 87 to 90 in the shade, we are slipping on an extra coat and wondering how it can feel so cold at 65. The change has been decidedly beneficial to the meat and cattle trade, and although it only made itself apparent on Thursday, it seems likely to keep up for a few days. Values for cattle are from to 1c stronger, and lightweight beasts of good quality might have made 1c more. The run of stock, however, from Canada and the States, has, as a rule, been to the heavy side, and consequently it has not been possible to make the most of the change. Advices from London report a steadier demand at Deptford and a fair good clearance at Smithfield. This will give some encouragement to our Birkenhead operators and induce a more active demand. Altogether the prospect is not so bad, and if exporters can now buy suitable stock at 3c to 3½c, and ship them on a 40s or 42s 6d freight, they can stand our markets with some degree of composure. LONDON DEPTFORD Monday's supply of 3,535 beasts, compared with Monday last, showed an increase of 937 head, and consisted of 1,710 from the States, 1,864 from Canada (the largest consignment this season), and 431 from South America. Owing to the large number on offer, combined with the hot weather, trade was very dull, rates being fully 1d per lb in favor of buyers for prime quality, and a still further decline for seconds, at which sales had to be forced and a clearance was almost impossible. The very best States and Canadians made 2s 1½d to 3s per lb. Argentines nominally quoted at 2s 4d to 2s 6d. The sheep supply, amounting to 1,987, was 171 larger than on Monday last, and consisted of shipments from Argentina. Trade was steady with an earlier clearance than usual. Best pens made 3s 1½d per 8 lbs. The following were the numbers on offer on the corresponding day, with the current top rates: Beasts, 2,873, 3s 10d to 3s 11d per 8 lbs; sheep, 4,115, 3s 10d to 4s per 8 lbs. On Thursday trade improved remarkably owing to the clearance reported at Smithfield (but forced at shocking prices) and the cooler weather following upon the heavy torrential rains pretty general over the country. The supply consisted of 1,538 States and 337 Canadian cattle. This did not, however, include all arrivals, a good many being kept in reserve for Monday and also to fill any requirements on Friday, Saturday or Sunday, the demand at times for extra orders occasionally helping out a bad sale on Thursday. Some good States and Canadians made up to 4½d, say 9c, but the current top rate for fair to good bullocks was 9c. No Argentines on offer. The sheep trade was quite active the short supply (900 South Americans and 57 Canadians) enabling sellers to put up the price to 6d (12½c) for picked pens of Argentines, the average of sales as they ran was quite 12c. The Canadian sheep were not a gilt-edged lot, and at 1s 1d (11½c) were well sold. A very much better trade is looked for next week, as the offerings are not likely to be too weighty."

"18970514","JUBILEE HELPS PRICES Butchers Take Advantage of It to Mark Up Their Goods - The Leading Market (From our own correspondent Liverpool, May 1) The general course of business in the principal open markets of the country is, on the whole, satisfactory, and for the best descriptions of cattle and sheep prices are well sustained. Lambs are coming forward more plentifully, but their condition is below the average, owing to the bleak weather experienced for some weeks back. As regards imported stock sales this week show a slight falling off in values - Glasgow values perhaps excepted, partly due to the heavy supplies and partly owing to the weather, which, for a couple of days, was very thundery and accompanied by torrential showers. So far as can be estimated the outlook for this season is still favorable to the Canadian exporter, as all the conditions that lead up to good markets are everywhere noticeable. These may again be briefly stated here, although I have already referred to them. To begin with, the war is virtually over, and although this may seem a very remote contingency or disturbing element in connection with our Canadian cattle shipping still, as affecting business generally, it must be taken into account. Then the supplies of native cattle and sheep are very moderate; indeed, in some districts there is a shortage on both, while the quality of native mutton is admittedly below the average. In the industrial centres an unusually active state of affairs is reported, the shipbuilding, engineering, iron and coal industries particularly enjoying the benefit of big orders in hand. These branches cover a wide area of industrial England including, of course, Scotland and Wales. The manufacturing districts in Lancashire, the Midland Counties, with Birmingham, Leicester and Sheffield thrown in, all report trade satisfactory, which is about as much as the phlegmatic Britisher can be brought to admit, even if he is coining money. Arthur Soavn, the diamond jubilee commemoration is expected to bring an extra million of people to the capital, and as they must bring with them at least a tenner, that means a wonderful addition to the turnover of the London shopkeeper. Of course the tenner will not be all spent in meat and drink, but a share of it must go to the hotel, restaurant, or boarding-house keeper, and thus indirectly to the butcher and baker. Already the astute, far-seeing carver of carcasses is putting his prices up on the score of its being jubilee year, you know, and if a customer wants to know why such an event should offer good and sufficient cause for adding a penny per pound to his meat, he is informed with a mysterious air that things are awful dear to buy, especially the extra choice meat as I have to get for such customers as you. Here is a specimen letter from the London Echo: BUTCHERS AND BEEF Sir, The butcher with whom I have been dealing for the past few years has raised all his beef 1d a pound, and gives as his reason for doing so that it is the Jubilee year. I cannot but think it would be a matter of public interest to know if this sort of imposition is to be general in this heavily-burdened and long-suffering metropolis. I am, sir, your obedient servant. Now, if the butcher is going to raise his price, the wholesale man is not above doing the same, and in turn why should not the live stock salesman get another half sovereign for his client, the Canadian exporter, who has in days gone by put many a fiver in the pockets of them all. Thus it goes round. John Bull is to pay more for his bit of meat, and all those interested in shipping it, slaughtering it, selling it, and serving it, have to be helped out of it. And now we infer from all the different items set forth above that the export season should be good, and that from the Manitoba ranches in the lovely Northwest to the sunny-faced butcher in the crowded quarters of Liverpool, Manchester, London and Glasgow, there will be the happiest possible recollections of Her Gracious Majesty's wonderful reign. The picture is so bright and cheerful one can hardly think it possible there is another side to it. And yet there is. I forbear, however, from dwelling on it, simply contenting myself by remarking that freights on United States cattle have jumped up 10s a head already, which would suggest that somebody else was going to have a bit out of the jubilee profit besides the butcher and the cattle exporter and not a little bit either."
"18971227","THE SMITHFIELD SHOW: Details of Leading Markets The Putchers' Boycott Canadians at Glasgow (From our own correspondent) Liverpool, December 11 With fierce gales off the land and off the sea, with torrential showers, hail and rain almost daily, we have had a rough time of it during the past week. Business has not benefited thereby; quite the contrary. Our country markets have been filling up with cattle and sheep in anticipation of the Christmas demand, while the usual attractive shows and sales of Christmas fat stock have kept many buyers away from Birkenhead, who will, however, probably find their way back after the festive season is over. While the country demand has thus been cut off to a considerable extent, our London customers have been buying pretty strong, the supplies at Deptford for the past ten days having been below the average. The worst of this London trade, however, is they want to buy all our choice beef, and when they get served, there is some difficulty in selling out the secondary and third class bodies left. Still, things keep moving along, and salesmen would not feel comfortable if they had nothing to grumble about."
"18980629","AUGUSTI'S POSITION He Cables the Madrid Government That It Is Grave HEKMED IN BY INSURGENTS Difficulties of Defence Are Increasing Provinces Are Deserting to Join the Insurgents Many Men Sick Madrid, June 28 The Government has received the following despatch from Captain-General Augusti, dated from Manila on June 23: ""The situation is still grave I continue to maintain my position inside the line of block houses; but the enemy is increasing in numbers, as the rebels occupy the provinces, which are surrendering. Torrential rains are inundating the entrenchments, rendering the work of defence difficult. The numbers of sick among the troops are increasing, making the situation very distressing, and causing increased desertions of the native soldiers. It is estimated that the insurgents number 30,000 armed with rifles, and 100,000 armed with swords, etc. Aguinaldo has summoned me to surrender but I have treated his proposals with disdain, for I am resolved to maintain the sovereignty of Spain and the honor of the king to the last extremity. I have over one thousand sick and 200 wounded. The citadel has been invaded by the suburban inhabitants, who have abandoned their homes owing to the barbarity of the rebels. These inhabitants constitute an embarrassment, aggravating the situation, in view of the bombardment, which, however, is not seriously apprehended for the moment. The Governor of the Visayas and Mindanao Islands cables that he has defeated the insurgents in an engagement during which Chief Arec, Aguinaldo's representative, was killed. He adds that tranquility now prevails throughout these islands, and he further asserts that the principal Malay chiefs of the Mindanao group declare they desire to fight on the side of the Spaniards. Madrid, June 28 Advices from Manila state that Captain-General Augusti's family is still in the hands of the insurgents. General Pena, with a thousand soldiers, has surrendered. His soldiers, most of whom were natives, joined the insurgents. A majority of the detachments in the Island of Luzon have surrendered owing to their lack of food, though some succeeded in escaping. Numerous Spaniards, including the Governors of Uatanga, Laguna and Dulacana, have taken refuge at Cavite. The rebels who are besieging Manila exceed 25,000 men. The city is completely isolated, and the arrival of the Spanish squadron is anxiously awaited, for the position of Manila is untenable. Small rebel craft navigate the bay, conveying prisoners to Cavite."

The men encamped are exposed to the weather, and unless a forward movement occurs soon much sickness is inevitable, as the camp is on low-lying land, not easily drained. According to the present plans it is probable a demand for the surrender of Manila will be sent to Captain-General Augustin. If surrender is refused the fleet will attack in front and the First and Second brigades, under General Anderson, will advance southeast through San Pedro, Macatu and Wanduolayon, upon the Spanish positions at Santa Mesa and Santa Anna. If Captain-General Augustin surrenders, the American troops will land at Manila, the troops at Camp Dewey holding the insurgents in check. General Anderson will not co-operate with the insurgents. General Greene, commanding Camp Dewey, has established outposts entirely regardless of the position of Aguinaldo's soldiers.

"18990114","T. Time Gen Henry I. Abbott arrived here yesterday from France on the steamship La Champagne. He was accompanied by M. Charon, said to be connected with the new Panama Canal Company. Gen Abbott was a member of the International Technical Commission, composed of engineers of the United States, France, Kuaalat, England, Germany, and Colombia, which recently made an inspection of the plans and work and suggested changes in the route of the Panama Canal. He is on his way to Washington to submit to the Government the information he possesses regarding the Interoceanic waterway at the Isthmus of Panama. He said yesterday that the French Government has no longer anything to do with the proposed canal, and the new company could dispose of its interest in the work to the United States without opposition from any source, provided the terms offered were satisfactory. The new canal company, with the 65,000,000 francs which it possessed when it secured the control of the cut, has simply been doing the preliminary work necessary on account of the mistaken ideas of the old engineers. No obstacles, such as the overflow of the Chagres River during the period of freshets, have been arranged for, and the old idea of making connection between ocean and ocean a tidewater one has been modified, so that the part yet to be finished will be built on the lock principle. Two-fifths of the entire canal work is now actually completed, and the balance is under active construction, with 2,000 workmen and a large force of engineers. Thus far, a distance of about fourteen miles of the tidewater part of the canal on the Atlantic side has been completed and is navigable to vessels drawing not more than twenty-eight feet of water. There are a few bars that only need dredging to make it passable for vessels of greater depth. Beyond that point, there has been considerable excavation to the twenty-one mile line from the Atlantic. Over four miles of the tidewater work on the Pacific side of the canal have also been finished. General Abbott declared that the new plans are perfectly feasible, and that the canal can be completed in one-half the time and at much less cost than it will take to dig the Nicaragua Canal. ""Were the two routes compared today,"" he continued, ""eight vessels to one would prefer the Panama route, because it is only forty-six miles across, and the Nicaragua course will be four times that length, and the windings of the San Juan River are very short and sharp. There is no reason why this country should not take hold of and finish the Panama cut."" President McKinley has recently been furnished with a full report of the International Technical Commission, and the present status of the canal may be the means of the abandonment of the Nicaragua project by the United States in favor of the Panama route. The report of the commission is probably the most authoritative document ever presented on an engineering subject. It has been prepared with the greatest care, after the most thorough and competent investigation and examination, with the most exhaustive surveys before the members. The surveys cover every foot of the ground to be treated, and were prepared by the most experienced engineers of five different nations. At the present time, the topography of all the grounds involved in the project, and the character of the materials to be encountered, are accurately known and delineated, and no doubt is left as to the soundness of the materials through which the canal is to be dug to great depths, and on which the foundations of the locks, dams, and other structures are to be established. ""The original purpose of the old company was to build a canal without locks, freely open from ocean to ocean, but after several years of work, the plan was abandoned, owing to the enormous excavation necessary to cut through the central mass of the mountains (the Culebra) and the difficulty and expense of properly taking care of the occasional torrential flow of the River Chagres. The alternate plan which has been adopted by the new company is to reduce materially the depth of the central excavation and to establish therein a system of locks, to be fed from the Chagres River in order properly to regulate the flow of the river; two large dams will be erected. One of the dams will be situated at Bohio, at the last group of locks on the Atlantic side. This dam transforms the Chagres into a vast lake, which will extend to Obispo, a distance of thirteen miles, and will cover an area of over twenty-one square miles. The dam, besides acting as a regulator of the Chagres floods, will obviate strong currents where the canal traverses the bed of the river, an extremely important matter for ocean shipping. The other dam will be situated at Alhajuela, on the Upper Chagres, about nine and one-third miles from the canal. It will form a reservoir covering ten miles, which will be a feeder to the summit level of the canal and will assist in regulating the flow of the Chagres. It will also furnish hydraulic power, transmitted by electricity, for operating the locks and lighting at night the entire canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific. ""Both dams can consequently accumulate a storage of at least 68,000,000,000 gallons, which, with proper adjustable weirs, will be more than sufficient to control the largest freshets known. The time of transit for vessels through the canal will be less than a day. Merchant and war vessels of the largest size can be accommodated. ""The estimates of the cost of the completion of the canal have been established from the experience acquired during the last four years of actual work on the isthmus, and are reported by the Technical Commission as follows: Cost of the work proper under plans adopted, $87,000,000; add for contingencies, $15,400,000; total $102,400,000. If both locks be built with a width of 82.025 feet, the cost would be increased to $125,000,000. ""Such, in brief, is the present state of the Panama Canal, and if this Government does not take advantage of the chance now offered, the waterway at the Isthmus will be completed by private capital. It will then be in operation years before the rival scheme proposed across Nicaragua could be finished, and, being a shorter route from ocean to ocean, would be a financial success, while the other cut, if ever carried out, would be a failure in more ways than one."" A NEW PICTURE ON WHICH BURNE-JONES WAS WORKING EIGHTEEN YEARS The chief topic of conversation in English artistic circles just now is the unfinished and never exhibited ""Arthur in Avalon,"" the vast picture on which Burne-Jones was engaged for eighteen years, and which had not received the last touches when death called upon him to cease his work forever. It is a huge canvas measuring more than 10 feet by 11 feet. Burne-Jones always intended it to rank as the great work of his life, and in no picture did he expend so much thought and positive labor. Although it is catalogued as unfinished, and although he so regarded it, it had very nearly reached completion; to most judgments, indeed, it would pass as a finished picture, though the artist intended to put more work into the heads and some other parts of the composition. The design represents the king lying asleep on a couch in the midst of a marble cloister; over his head is a canopy of gilt bronze, adorned with designs from the history of the Holy Grail. The three queens are at the head and foot of the couch; maidens, with musical instruments, are seated in front; three squires standing to the right keep the king's armory while other figures on either hand are holding horns or trumpets, or waiting for the signal which is to awaken the king. Like most of the painter's latest creations, the picture suggests tapestry, just as his early work used to suggest stained glass; but it is lovely tapestry, and by those who appreciate the quiet key of color which characterizes his later works, this ""Avalon"" will be found to be one of the most satisfying of any. In many ways, indeed, the last period of Burne-Jones was not so good as the period that came a little earlier; his types became exaggerated and he tended to repeat himself. But for all that, ""Arthur in Avalon"" must always rank as one of his most important pictures, and the very dimensions of it seem to designate it for a public gallery. NEW CURES FOR CONSUMPTION Results of a Russian Surgeon's Injections of Natrum and Cinnamyllcum London Telegraph St. Petersburg December 25 Some interesting reports have been current recently concerning the discovery by a Russian physician of a new method of treating consumption, which is said to have already given brilliant results. As is well known, none of the new cures for consumption, not even excepting that of Prof. Koch, have been very successful, but it is stated that the experiments made by Dr. Lovsky with natrum cinnamyllcum have turned out very well. I am, of course, not a medical expert, and therefore I can only write of what I hear at a recent meeting of the Society of Medicine in this country, at which Dr. Lovsky presented an account of his discovery. He gave particulars of five cases upon which he had produced visible effects by injections of natrum cinnamyllcum. At the outset, the doctor stated that at the beginning of the treatment, all the patients were suffering from what the faculty regarded as the most painful form of tuberculosis, but that in the course of a short period their health was re-established sufficiently to enable them to return to work. He said that treatment by natrum cinnamyllcum in the form of balsam of Peru had been tried by Landerer in 1888 in cases of surgical tuberculosis. He used the balsam as an emulsion with gum arabic and tried it with success in 170 cases. Following Landerer, a whole series of medical men carried on experiments, trying also other preparations of the balsam, and in 1887 works were published on the subject by Dr. Goutcharenko and other doctors. In all cases, the results were favorable, and this circumstance induced Dr. Lovsky to undertake his essays, using injections under the shoulder blades. The invalids were divided into three categories: first, those with changes in the form of the lungs, both with and without hollows; secondly, those with changes, not only in the lungs, but in other parts of the lungs; thirdly, those with the dangerous form of miliary tuberculosis. The results obtained were mixed. One patient was in a desperate condition and died a few days later; another, having felt relief, came no more for treatment. The rest were present at the meeting of the society. Of these patients, one, a doorman, who had no regular nourishment, came to Dr. Lovsky in March of the present year. He had a strong cough, severe perspiration, and feverishness; diminution of vital power had prevented him from following his business, and the diagnosis clearly showed that he was suffering from tuberculosis. The injections of natrum cinnamyllcum were commenced on March 13, and were repeated every three or four days. For the first two months, there was no sign of amelioration in his condition, but afterward it soon appeared, and the symptoms subsided. He gained eight pounds in weight, despite his insufficient food, and he is now in good health and able to follow his occupation. From March 15 to the present time, he has received fifty-three injections in the region of the shoulder blade. Patient No. 2 was in a very bad way, and galloping consumption was even feared. In April last, he had four injections and was ordered to drink koumiss. His condition soon improved, and although bacilli are still to be detected, they are far less numerous, and he seems to be getting on well. Patient No. 3 was a young man twenty-eight years of age. His treatment began on September 15, and by November 22, his weight had increased, and although his state had been very grave, the bacilli had disappeared at the end of eighty days; he felt well and was able to work. The other cases were of similar character. ON THE CONTINENT Vienna, January 13 A terrible gale has been raging here since early this morning. Much damage has been done to property, and there have been many accidents. Berlin, January 13 Reports received here late this afternoon describe a violent gale in northern and western Germany, and thunderstorms and torrential rains in southern Germany. At Stuttgart, a large scaffolding was blown down and a man killed. Dieppe, January 13 The destruction of the locality here by the storm has blocked the channel with girders. The packet boat from England to connect here with the express for Paris was unable to enter the harbor this evening and was obliged to return to New Haven with her passengers. Immense damage has been done to the Plage Gardens and Casino here, and at Tourville the gale has worked similar injury, the beach being torn up and the valley flooded for an area of three kilometers. Ten chalets facing the sea have been destroyed, forty bathing boxes washed away, and the Casino wrecked. At Le Treport, sixteen miles northeast of Dieppe, the Casino was partly carried out to sea and many chalets have been damaged. The whole coast is strewn with debris. London, January 13 The gale appeared to be passing in the direction of Russia. There is still many hours' delay in telegraph communication from the continent, and it is feared that accounts of serious ravage there will soon be received. A dispatch from Brest says that along the Finisterre coast a large quantity of wreckage has come ashore with carcasses of sheep and cattle, and it is believed that a large ship has foundered. Heavy damage is already reported from Ostend, Blankenberge, about nine miles northwest of Bruges, and other coastal towns."
"18990919","NEW ARGENTINE RULES Details of the Leading Foreign Animals Markets - A Sheep Sale From our own correspondent Liverpool, September 9 Business has been bad, chiefly due to the sultry weather since greatly improved after a torrential downpour of rain, and a magnificent thunderstorm. Supplies on the open market still continue liberal, owing to prospects of Winter beef being so poor, but this premature disposal will probably now be checked, as in many districts there is quite a marvellous recovery of aftergrowth. A feature of the trade at Deptford has been the complete absence of South American cattle and sheep. This is attributed to the stringent rules and regulations enforced by the Argentine Government which came into operation on 1st August. It is said that shipowners object to the serious liability imposed by these regulations, and have refused point-blank to carry cattle at any price. So far Argentine shippers have not lost much, and as this is the quiet season with them, we presume shipowners and exporters are bluffing the Government a bit, and at the same time seeing what effect it has on markets this side."

"18991018","A PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY, Calve's Carmen is a psychological study worthy of much deeper analysis; but perhaps what strikes the ordinary observer more is the extraordinary versatility and power of the actress. Carmen's torrential passions require an energy of expression within the capabilities of very few on the tragic stage today; her fierce blazes of anger cannot be expressed by poise and fury; they come from the very depths of her nature. With the startling suddenness of a summer thunderstorm, these outbursts of concentrated passion break in upon Carmen's gentler moods. One moment she is all smiles and witchery; the next a demon of malice and hatred. How Calve expresses all this and brings it home to the most careless observer cannot be told in cold print. Her lissome grace of movement, suggestive of the tigeress or the serpent, her wonderful play of feature, from her arch raillery in the first scene to the dumb horror and amazement with which she faces her fate as told by the cards, her last cry as she flees from death all this is beyond description, and it would be worse than useless to attempt it."
