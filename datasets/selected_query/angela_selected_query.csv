18800116,historical,storm,"K, iTMO, asked if the Board thought the unpaid capital could be collected. The Cashier replied that under the Act MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 16, 1880, the stock of all those who did not pay up their calls could be confiscated. Mr. Baebsac asked on what basis was the valuation of the real estate made. The Cashier said the property owned by the Bank was on St Joseph and Seigneur streets, and gave a return of 5 per cent. The valuation was its actual worth. Mr. Babeiac entered into a lengthy charge against the management, contending that the Bank had not sufficient capital to do a profitable business, and that the shareholders had not been sufficiently consulted. A general meeting, he argued, should have been called after the Paquet defalcation, and also when the fusion with the Jacques Cartier Bank was under consideration. Had the latter been accomplished the result, he contended, would have been ruinous to the bank. Hon. Mr. Thibaudac replied to the charges made by Mr. Barbeau. The argument of the latter in relation to the circulation and reserve fund of the bank was absurd. As to calling a general meeting of the shareholders after the defalcation of Mr. Paquet, that would destroy the credit of the bank, for the shareholders under the excitement of the moment when rumors were afloat detrimental to various monetary institutions, would have caused precipitate action. As far as the fusion with the Jacques Cartier Bank was concerned, no measure to that end could have been passed without the consent of the shareholders and without an Act of Parliament to authorize it. It was not customary in the consideration of such questions for the directors to call a meeting until they had the scheme fully digested. Mr. Bxiqcx stated that if the fusion with the Jacques Cartier Bank was not proposed to the shareholders, it was because the directors of the Hochelaga Bank did not consider the terms offered by the Jacques Cartier Bank satisfactory. As to Mr. Barbeau's complaint that the defalcation of Mr. Paquet was owing to insufficient precautions having been taken by the Jacques Cartier Bank, he might say that the Jacques Cartier Bank's system in this respect had been the same as those then followed by other banks, and that the City and District Savings Bank had adopted further precautions in relation to its officers since Mr. Paquet's defalcation had been discovered. The Hochelaga Bank had also taken greater precautions and measures since that incident. Aid. Labebgi said that he had entered this meeting with views opposed to the management of the Hochelaga Bank, but since Mr. Barbeau's speech, he had altered his views and considered that the directors had done all in their power to provide against losses. He was, therefore, fully satisfied with the conduct of the directors and considered they should be re-elected. After some further discussion, the President made a speech which fairly carried away the audience and enlisted their sympathies and support on behalf of the directors. He sketched a history of the Bank, which was started in 1873, just as the years of financial crisis were opening, and gave the Bank great credit for maintaining its credit while other institutions were crashing around it. Four Banks, each with much larger capital than this one, had been obliged to close their doors, and yet the Hochelaga Bank weathered the difficulty, and probably with careful management would, now that the crisis was over, succeed in recovering lost ground and causing its shares to be rated at par. But to do this, its shareholders should give it every support by giving it the support of their business instead of transacting their affairs with other banks; and in this respect he cited the example of the butchers, who deposited their receipts with it as one worthy of emulation. Aid. JXAXXOTTX said he had a delicate question to ask of the directors, and amidst a storm of hisses, asked the directors if it was true that they made their deposits with other banks. The President was about to reply, when Hon. Mr. Thibaudean said it would be an insult to a meeting of the respectability of this one, for the president to answer a question of this kind, and the answer was not pressed for. The Cashier, in reply to a shareholder, said the shares of the bank stood today worth 87 per cent. The usual votes of thanks to the directors, cashier and officers were then moved and carried, without dissent after which Aid. Grenier moved, seconded by Aid. Jeannotte, that the old Board be re-elected. This motion was also carried unanimously, after which the meeting was declared closed. The new Board of Directors therefore consists of the following gentlemen: Mr. DISABLED STEAMER. On Monday last the steamship Plainmeller, Capt. Ford, from Newcastle, England, and bound to New York with a cargo of pig iron, put in here in a disabled condition. She left Newcastle on the 9th of December, and on the 16th encountered a hurricane by which the two starboard boats were carried away and the cabin was stove in. On the following day, the wind still blowing with terrible violence, Capt. Ford was coming out of the chart room, when a tremendous sea struck the ship and he was carried overboard and disappeared almost instantly. On the 22nd another storm arose, and the sea swept the decks, smashing the bulwarks from the bridge aft, destroying the steering gear and carrying overboard a seaman named Anderson. Next day the storm abated and the ship's course was shaped for this port. The hull is much strained, and it is thought the cargo will have to be landed to admit of the necessary repairs being effected. We are once more reminded of the necessity of a graving dock in a port such as this, lying near the track of the trans-Atlantic steamers, which, as in this instance, are frequently disabled and require repairs. It is calculated that had there been a graving dock here, the S8, Arizona would have paid in dock dues not less than 2,000, and the Plainmeller would have added a handsome sum. CHRISTMAS Christmas Day is honored here by a strict observance by all classes and denominations. Nearly all the churches were open for service both morning and evening. Charity to the poor was dispensed with a liberal hand; family gatherings and quiet and sober enjoyment marked the festive season, and were in accord with the spirit of the day. Reviewing the year now gone, we have reason for thankfulness that a fair share of prosperity has been awarded to us; there is no great amount of poverty, and our working classes are in comfortable circumstances. THE S3, rXAraXELUR. The steamship Austrian is behind time, and I add a few particulars regarding the steamship Plainmeller, whose captain was unhappily lost overboard before she reached this port. Captain Ford, who was only 28 years of age, was a resident of Bristol, England, and, by all who knew him, was highly esteemed for his manly qualities, his courage and generosity. He was a fine specimen of a true British sailor bold, skillful, cool and self-possessed in danger. In November last he was mate of the steamer Fernwood, on her voyage from Baltimore to Liverpool, when she fell in with the ship Forest Belle in a sinking condition. By great gallantry and daring he succeeded in rescuing the crew, ten in number, by means of his lifeboat, risking his life in the midst of a heavy gale and stormy sea on this mission of mercy. For this gallant deed he received the Royal Humane Society's medal just before leaving on the present voyage, which unfortunately proved to be his last. In a tremendous gale, on December 16th, a heavy sea struck the Plainmeller, which shifted the cargo and gave her a bad list to starboard, so that the rail was under water, and the vessel strained and labored heavily. On the following day Captain Ford had just taken his observation at noon, and was returning from the bridge to the chart room when a heavy sea struck the vessel and carried him overboard. Only two men were on deck at the wheel, and on the alarm being given the steward threw a life buoy to the captain who was struggling in the water. The buoy was only 30 yards from him, and being a splendid swimmer he made towards it, when the force of the wind, as it rose on the top of the sea, carried it right away from him. He then turned towards the ship, but almost immediately disappeared. The sea was running mountains high, and nothing could be done to save him. He was to have been married on his return to England to a young lady in Bristol. The chief officer, Mr. Matthews, and the chief engineer deserve great credit for bringing the steamer safe to this port, after battling with a succession of fearful gales, with a wrecked vessel and such a dangerous cargo as pig iron. The Plainmeller now lies at the wharf of the Hon. A. Shea, agent for the Allan Co., who has entire charge of the vessel, and is pressing on the repairs with all due speed. The want of a graving dock to effect such repairs as she requires is once more demonstrated, and it is to be hoped initiatory steps will soon be taken to secure such a desideratum. Since a week before Christmas the weather has been unusually cold and stormy, the thermometer, on one or two occasions, having been four degrees below zero, a very uncommon occurrence so early in the winter. On New Year's Day we had a heavy snowstorm. OUB LONDON LETTER. A Christmas to The Sheffield election Conservative demonstration in Le Tlehnorne claimant Loss of the Borsnsln The small birds, from our correspondent LONDON, January 24, 1879. Christmas day has brought the densest and most disagreeable fog that we have experienced in London for some years. In this suburb St John's Wood which is generally comparatively free from fog, it is impossible at mid-day to make out even the outline of any object on the opposite side of the road, and the condition of the central parts of the metropolis, where the fog usually contains a considerable admixture of smoke, must be much worse. Diners out will have some difficulty in reaching their destination, for all traffic, except on the underground railway, is necessarily suspended, and few undertakings are so dubious as to result as the attempt to find one's way, in a dense fog, to a particular house in an unfamiliar quarter. Consequently there will be many vacant chairs at Christmas dinner tables today. The result of the Sheffield elections has been a surprise for most of us, not because the Liberal candidate has won, but because the Conservative party made such a gallant fight for the vacant seat. To poll within five hundred votes of their opponents in such a hotbed of Radicalism as Sheffield is unquestionably a triumph for the Government; and there can no longer be any doubt that a very large number of electors in the large constituencies who formerly supported Mr. Gladstone, are now followers of Lord Beaconsfield. It should be remembered that this is the first opportunity we have had of testing the relative strength of parties in the great boroughs since the Manchester election three years ago; and opinions were very much divided as to the effect which subsequent events have produced upon the minds of the independent section of electors whose votes decide every close contest. The Conservatives were by no means confident of making even a creditable spar, although they assumed a bold front to the last. They had been disappointed by the refusal of their most promising candidate, Mr. Mark Addy, to contest the seat; they had to put up with a young man, Mr. Stuart Wortley, a nephew of the Earl of Wharncliffe, of no local influence, without experience or distinction except in connection with a noble family; and on the other side was arrayed an organization which ever since Sheffield received the franchise, has monopolized the representation of the borough, and signally defeated every attempt to dispute its supremacy. Mr. Waddy, moreover, was a strong candidate. If, as a temperance man, he alienated the sympathies of the publicans, on the other hand he secured the adherence of the Permissive Bill party, who muster strongly in Sheffield. His opinions were advanced enough by securing the support of the Radicals to prevent the division of strength which has often been so fatal in Radical constituencies. He was especially recommended to the deluded idiots who still believe in the innocence of the Claimant; and on the Saturday before the election, the Irish vote, strong, was pledged in his favor. Three Irish members of Parliament Sullivan, Finigan, and Justin McCarthy strongly urged their fellow-countrymen to support Mr. Waddy. They said that he had given satisfactory assurances, that he had promised seriously to consider Irish questions, and to vote for an alteration of the land laws; and their exhortations were supported by a telegram from Mr. Parnell, calling upon every Irishman to aid in defeating the Government upon their chosen ground. The effect of all this was to throw the Irish vote en bloc into the Liberal scale at the last moment, and there can be no doubt that it decided the result of the election. How many moderate Liberals were disgusted by this coquetting with the Home Rule party we have no means of ascertaining, but it is probable that the loss was far inferior to the gain. Mr. Waddy owes his seat, therefore, to the Irish element in this constituency, and it is probable that Mr. Parnell and his influences will be able, as they had boasted, to influence the elections in about a dozen of our largest constituencies in the same manner. At the last elections in 1874 the Conservatives deemed themselves so weak in Sheffield that they ran no candidate of their own and supported Mr. Roebuck in order to keep out Mr. Chamberlain, now the radical member for Birmingham. They succeeded. In 1868 they started a candidate who only polled about 5,000 votes against a gross total of 42,000 on the other side. At the next general elections they may or may not be successful. The battle will then be fought on the new register, which has added some 3,000 votes to the Liberal strength; but there is a delightful uncertainty about the ballot which falsifies the most careful calculation. It is needless to remark that the result of the election has cast a gloom over the councils of the opposition. If they can only just manage to win in Sheffield, what hope have they of carrying the constituencies in Lancashire and Yorkshire, where, if public opinion has changed in the same degree as at Sheffield, their prospects must be well-nigh hopeless, with or without the help of the Irishmen. The Conservative demonstration at Leeds organized to give Sir Stafford Northcote an opportunity of replying to Mr. Gladstone's criticisms upon his financial policy, was successful, not only in point of numbers, but political effect. The Chancellor of the Exchequer showed himself thoroughly capable of defending his measures, and met Mr. Gladstone very fairly upon the statistical argument. It is significant, however, that he claimed the right to set off against the deferred extraordinary expenditures, which last April were already nearly four millions, the reduction effected in the national debt by the extended creation of terminable annuities and the new sinking fund, from which it is inferred that the Government will meet their difficulties next year by boldly transferring that portion of the floating debt for which they are responsible to the funded debt, just as the special appropriation from the Indian Exchequer for the Famine Fund has been recklessly expended upon the Afghan war. This would certainly not be an unpopular measure, for the taxpayers quake at the prospect of having to meet a deficit in the ordinary budget and the payment of deferred liabilities together, would otherwise be the case; and they will be thankful for relief in whatever shape it comes. The Tichborne Association propose to put the Claimant in candidature for Nottingham at the general election. That interesting criminal has almost completed seven years of his term of penal servitude, and his friends are endeavoring to upset the sentence upon a writ of error, and thus obtain his release. The objection taken is purely technical. The power of the Judge to sentence him to penal servitude for seven years is not disputed, of course. The contention of the Claimant's friends is that that term exhausted the punitive power: but inasmuch as the Lord Chief Justice passed the sentence, it will probably prove to be duly supported by legal authority and precedents. We have very meager accounts of the loss of the Borussia, the Dominion Line steamer which foundered in the Atlantic but it is suspected that she was not seaworthy, and more than hinted that the crew left the passengers to their fate. The statements of the survivors are conflicting, one of them admitting at first that there was a panic on board the ill-fated vessel, and that the crew lowered the boats without orders; the others earnestly asseverating that nothing of the kind happened. There were no passengers in the boat that was picked up. Her crew consisted of three of the officers and half a dozen seamen, a fact which points not so much to a save as the deliberate abandonment of the passengers. A Board of Trade enquiry is to be immediately held upon the disaster. It has been remarked that our stock of small birds has greatly diminished since last year. The hard winter killed a good many of them, and the survivors were again thinned by the wet weather in the summer, which, moreover, prevented them from breeding. The woods and hedges are now comparatively deserted. Last winter, too, during the cold weather, numbers of small birds were driven to seek for food in the gardens of the London suburbs, where ordinarily speaking nothing but smoky sparrows are to be seen. This year, instead of a small flock of linnets, finches, robins, thrushes, starlings and other winter residents, there is scarcely even a house sparrow. Perhaps our feathered friends took timely notice of the approaching frost and migrated to summer climes; but it is generally thought that most of them are dead. ",

Mays 121 New Job Printing House We take much pleasure in announcing to our friends and the public that we have added to our Binder and Stationery business well and our PRINTING OFFICE, which will be under the special charge of Mr. Hugh Caverot Jr., who was admitted a partner in our firm, January 5th from 1st September. With new type, the latest improved presses and steam power, we are in a position to turn out first-class work with promptness and reasonable rates. The combination of Bindery, Stationery and Printing departments under one roof gives us unprecedented facilities for executing orders in all the branches to the satisfaction of our customers. STON, PHILLIPS & Co. Job Printers, 128 Notre Dame Street, Continued from second page some of them had paid a much higher price than they should have done for their wagons, etc. It is a great mistake for immigrants to take heavy articles with them; the carriage costs more than they are worth. We started for THE PRAIRIE DISTRICT, crossing the Assiniboine, which will rail lay for 40 miles along the banks of the Red River. For ten miles or so to the La Salle River the road passes through a rather low and wooded country, most of the timber being in small copses. We then emerge on open prairie, most of the river lots being settled and under cultivation. This continued, with intervals of unbroken prairie, all the way to Morris, which we reached at dusk. The prairie west of the road was mostly unbroken and had been swept by fire. We saw a good many stacks of prairie hay and some cattle. Prairie chickens were pretty numerous, and we shot 25 brace on this journey. The land at Morris is hardly so heavy as nearer Winnipeg. Winnipeg. Crops were reported to average 18 to 20 bushels per acre. Next day we struck west along the second base line, and ten miles out reached the Lowe farm, the only house for 25 miles. We were kindly entertained by Mr. Lowe, Jr., on our return. This farm consists of 19,000 acres, which Messrs. Lowe intend farming on a scale similar to the Dalrymple farms. They have erected a fine house and buildings and have 500 acres broken for next crop. They have had some losses among their horses, the work of breaking being severe, and the hay and water not suiting horses from Ontario at first. Oxen or mules do better for breaking. They have also had some difficulty in getting good water, and have put down a bore of 90 feet in the rock, where they hope to find a good supply. Meantime they have to draw supplies some distance. Water is one of the first considerations with the settler. It is rare that water is so difficult to get as in the case we have mentioned. The water of the creeks is good, and we made a point of tasting the well water at a good many places we visited. Sometimes it was sweet, and sometimes it had an alkaline or sulphurous taste, but stock take to it readily enough. The Lowe farm is all level prairie, with a little marsh, on which you might drive a plough for miles in any direction. It is intersected here and there by small channels or coulees, which carry off the water in spring, but do not impede a plough or reaper. The soil is a rich, black mould, eighteen inches deep on a clay subsoil. Our trail for several miles lay through the south corner of the big marsh, consisting of many thousand acres, which is flooded by the Boyne River in the rainy season, but could be drained with little difficulty. It was covered with most luxuriant grass, in some places three to four feet high. In some places it was still soft, and the horses went up to the knees and pulled us through with some difficulty. We travelled over 40 miles, and reached Messrs. Bidder's farm on Tobacco Creek just in time, as we were hardly well inside when a thunderstorm, with heavy rain, came on, and a very dark night. Next day we drove over Messrs. Bidder's farm and some of the surrounding country. Messrs. Bidder have several thousand acres of nice dry land, well situated on the creek, along which there is some fair timber. They have not yet cultivated much wheat, as they are some distance from a market, but they expect ere long to have communication with Winnipeg by the Pembina Railway branch, which will add greatly to the value of their land. Their wheat has averaged fully thirty bushels per acre. This and the Pembina mountain district is considered one of the finest parts of Manitoba. The Pembina mountains are terraces of some 200 to 300 feet high, well clad with timber, their summits being an immense plateau of level prairie, which is thickly settled nearly as far west as Rock Lake. This district is fairly well wooded and grows the wild dog rose, a sign of good dry land. We re-crossed the Atlantic with a young man who had bought 320 acres, with a log house and some improvements, for $800. We had fine weather for our return to Winnipeg, and witnessed a Red River dance at Morris. We also drove out to Mr. Gerrie's farm on Sturgeon Creek, eight miles northwest of Winnipeg. Mr. Gerrie owns 40,000 acres in different parts of the Province, and has here a block of 5,000 acres, nearly all dry and well situated. The soil is a black loam of 12 to 18 inches deep, on a friable clay loam. A crop of oats, sown on breaking, had been very bulky; but the quality of the oats grown on new land is generally poor. Mr. Gerrie has sold a part of this block at $1 an acre. Returning to Winnipeg we passed through a considerable breadth of lower land on which hay had been cut. We saw loads going into town, where it sells from $6 to $8 a ton in quantity. Six dollars is about the lowest price; and as the cost of cutting, stacking, and delivering in town does not exceed $3 to $3.50 per ton, it seems to be a profitable business on land which yields two tons per acre, and which can be bought at less than $5. We also drove out with Mayor Logan and some other gentlemen to Bird Hill, east of the Red River, from which we had a fine view. The country east of the river is more rolling and broken than the west side, and more wooded. We saw prairie fires to the south and west. The railway from Winnipeg to Selkirk is now finished, and we saw here some large deposits of gravel, which by-and-bye will be of great use in road making. We passed through the settlement of SILDOXA, which skirts both banks of the Red River north of Winnipeg. It was settled by Highlanders from Sutherlandshire in 1812. The claims are from 5 to 12 chains wide, and go four miles back. Only a small proportion along the river is cultivated, the rest being used for hay and pasture. We saw land which had been in wheat for 35 to 50 years, and took samples of the wheat, soil, and subsoil. We also saw some first-rate turnips. We did not see any signs of manure being applied, though we saw manure heaps, the accumulations of 50 years. As there is no decrease of crops the natives do not think it necessary to use manure yet; indeed it has been customary to draw the manure on to the ice of the river in winter and allow it to go off in the spring freshets. Others who had not this facility had found it necessary to remove their barns rather than remove the manure heap. The cultivated land was clean and seemed in good condition. On the banks of the river we could see a depth of 12 to 14 feet of soil, all alluvial deposit. The settlement of Selkirk, farther down the river, was settled in the same way, and is similar to Kildonan. Returning to Winnipeg we saw a start being made on the first section of the Canada Pacific Railway west of the point. The construction of this section is contracted for at $6,000 per mile, being little more than the cost of rails, sleepers, and ballasting. The cost of working will also be light, as the steepest gradient from Lake Superior to the Rocky Mountains does not exceed 1 in 100. When in Winnipeg a banquet was given to the Ministers Aikins and Bowell, to which the delegates were invited, and at which a great future for the Northwest was confidently predicted. Mr. Cowan, from Wigtownshire, who visited the district west of the Portage, as far as Rapid City, kindly favored us with his notes on that section. He says the land for 12 miles west of the Portage is good, similar to the land of High Bluff. Twenty miles west is low and rather marshy, then changes to a sandy loam, and then very low for 16 miles past Gladstone, and no use till drained. The trail here strikes White Mud River, a clear, and in places rapid stream. From White Mud River to Stoney Creek and over Riding Mountains, the land is light and sandy in parts, but generally good rolling prairie, fit for mixed husbandry, till the Prairie City on the Little Saskatchewan is reached. From Prairie City to Rapid City the trail is along this river, the banks of which are light and gravelly, but a mile back the land is good rolling prairie, not quite so heavy as the land near the Portage. The south trail from Rapid City to the Portage passes through land similar to that we have described. In this big plain, 23 miles east, Mr. McKenzie has a farm of 4,000 acres. This gentleman, who came from Ontario eleven years ago, gave Mr. Cowan some useful information. He owns about 18,000 acres of land, selected very judiciously in various parts of the province. One of his sons is on a farm of 1,700 acres on the Beautiful Plain, and has 300 acres under crop. He has also a grazing farm, 60 miles northwest of the Portage, on which he says 800 acres would yield enough hay to winter 2,500 cattle. He lives on a farm of 2,400 acres, 9 miles west of Portage-la-Prairie, some of which he has cultivated for nine consecutive years. His wheat yielded 41 bushels per acre in 1877, 36 bushels last year, and he expects 40 bushels from this year's crop, all of the fine variety, and 60 to 62 lbs per bushel. He sows wheat from 15th April to 12th May, and reaps in August. Oats may be sown till 20th May, and barley as late as 10th June. Oats yield 75 to 80 bushels per acre, 34 to 36 lbs; barley, 40 to 45 bushels, 50 to 53 lbs. He drills in about 1 bushel of each. His land is a good black loam, 18 inches deep, on a subsoil of 3 or 4 feet of loamy clay, and grows excellent crops of roots of all kinds. Potatoes, with very rude cultivation, grow 7 to 10 tons per acre, and turnips as high as 30 tons without manure; swedes frequently weigh 16 to 20 lbs. One exhibited last year weighed 36 lbs. Good water is found at 16 feet, and stock do well. Mackenzie has a stock of very useful well-bred cattle, the best in the Province. He finds a ready market for all his produce in settlers coming in, and expects to need no other for some years. He pays $40 a year and board for white labor; and $2 per day and board for Indian labor. He had an Indian ploughing one of his fields. Mackenzie must be considered a good authority on the matter of crops, but his results are relatively considerably better than the average, and it would not be safe to calculate on his figures. Though we spent nearly four weeks on our journey to and from Manitoba, including the time we were there, we only saw a very small proportion of the 1,000,000 acres it contains; and as Manitoba is only the beginning of the immense extent of fertile country which extends to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, we can hardly do more than say that we have had our foot in the Northwest. The British possessions in North America are larger than the whole of Europe, and larger than the United States, without Alaska; and as the wheat region through which the Canada Pacific Railway will pass is estimated to contain 160 million acres, the Canadians may well be enthusiastic over their possessions. None of the delegates went west of Rapid City, but the country south to the Assiniboine is reported good dry land, water good, and timber scarce. At Shoal Lake, 40 miles away, the land is similar, and on to Fort Ellice and the Touchwood Hills. At Edmonton, 850 miles, the land is said to be undulating and of the highest cultivation, and those who have visited the Peace River describe it as the finest country of the whole, and say that notwithstanding its high latitude it grows richly, while owing to its situation on the east slope of the Rocky Mountains, the climate is much milder than in the much lower latitudes. A diagram to a man, on which isothermal lines of winter and summer are marked, will illustrate this. But I may say that while it is in the same latitude as Scotland, the summer is similar to that of Belgium. Most of the land in Manitoba is now taken up, and emigration is moving westward to the free grant lands. The land is surveyed in sections of a mile square, or 640 acres; half of these sections, corresponding to the white squares of a draught board, are reserved as railway lands, and sold at fixed prices according to distance from the line of railway. The sections corresponding to the black squares are reserved as free grant lands, each settler receiving 160 acres on payment of a nominal sum, and with power to buy 160 acres more on easy terms, the price varying from $1 to $2.50 per acre. The policy of the Government is, if possible, to build the railway ahead of settlement, but we hardly think it will succeed. The Government also wish to prevent speculators getting possession of large breadths of land to hold on speculation, but in this they have hitherto failed, as many men own from 10 to 40 thousand acres within 100 miles of Winnipeg. These lands at present bring in no revenue to the owners; indeed it is probable that some are paying interest on the purchase money at high rates. These lands are all for sale at prices from $1 to $5 per acre for unbroken land, and in some cases improved lots might be bought for much higher sums. There are many men who have taken up homesteads and preemptions who will sell their rights for a small profit, so there is no likelihood of land being scarce for many years to come, and settlers who can pay the prices I have named do not need to go far west unless they choose. On the whole, I was favorably impressed with Manitoba, and the other delegates whom I met expressed the same opinion. No one who sees the immense extent of fertile soil and the excellence of its products can doubt for a moment that there is a great future before that country. Nearly everyone we met who had seen anything of the Northwest spoke of it in glowing terms; and though it is necessary to allow considerable discounts of the statements of those who have not much experience in agriculture, we were satisfied that settlers with industry, experience, and some capital could not fail to do well. A man with $100 can make a start on a homestead; a man with $200 to $300 can start well; but as a rule men with more capital have the best chance. Stock do well, but require shelter and hay in winter. There is a good home trade in cattle, large numbers being imported at present from Minnesota. The cattle we saw in Manitoba were good and strong, rather short of breeding, but infinitely superior to the Texas and native Colorado cattle we afterwards saw in Chicago market. We think Galloway cattle would suit the country well. Yearling cattle were selling at $12 to $16; two-year-olds at $20 to $25; and three-year-olds at $40 to $45. Draft oxen bring $90 to $180 per pair according to size, condition, and training. Most of the settlers at present are avoiding the low lands and taking up the dry lands for wheat-growing, which gives a quicker return than cattle; but as soon as stock-raising is more general, we think these lands will be found very valuable. We saw some few flocks of 50 to 100 sheep. In some districts a spear grass grows, which gets into the wool, pierces the skin, and kills the animal; but this only occurs at one part of the year, and when the land is cultivated this grass disappears. Like cattle, sheep require shelter and hay in winter. The disadvantages of Manitoba are at present bad roads, especially in the rainy season; the long winter of fully five months; the scarcity of wood and of water in some parts; the mosquitoes and black flies, which for a couple of months in summer, and especially in marshy places, are very annoying to man and beast, and particularly to new settlers. The opening of the railway will help to get over the first difficulty, and also bring in supplies of timber where needed. Care is required in selecting land where good water can be had. The winter is long, and the temperature often very low; but we were assured by Governor Morris and others that the cold is not severe, as the air is generally still and clear, and that even invalids with weak lungs find the climate healthy and pleasant. There is no cure for the insect plagues, which, however, disappear as the land is drained and cultivated. It is well for the emigrant to be prepared for these difficulties, which we would be careful neither to exaggerate nor conceal. As a field for money-making and enterprise, we consider the Northwest decidedly the best part of the Dominion; and those who are willing to face those difficulties and disadvantages of pioneer life, difficulties and disadvantages which will be rapidly overcome, and which are nothing to those which the early settlers in Ontario had to contend with, have every prospect of success and independence. It would be a great mistake to suppose that I recommend Manitoba to all who think of emigrating. The propriety of going there depends very much on the means and habits of the emigrant. There are many whom I could not recommend to make a change which would involve the loss of a good many of their present life comforts, and which might be especially hard on the female members of the family; but young people with health, energy, and some means, accustomed to work, would certainly improve their condition and do well. There are many families, too, who may be working as hard here, without making things any better, as they would have to do there, for whom the change would be a good one. We left Winnipeg on Tuesday, 21st October, and, travelling night and day, reached Chicago in 48 hours. We passed over the St. Paul and Michigan Central Railways, a distance of 1,200 miles, on free passes. These railways carry most of the emigrants who go to the Northwest at present, and the arrangements are very satisfactory. During the whole of the first day we traversed the expanse of burned prairie we have already described, which often stretched away for miles to the horizon unbroken by a house or tree, but strewn with numerous bones of buffalo, deer and other animals, scattered over the surface, or half buried in the soil. Near Emerson and Cookton we saw some farms of considerable size; on one there were excellent buildings, and five or six teams were returning from work. On another we saw ten horses at work driving a thrashing machine; there were more than 100 large stacks of wheat in the fields and at the buildings, and it struck us that there was work enough for a steam thrasher, and that the horses would have been better employed ploughing. At night we passed some extensive prairie fires, which were tearing along before a brisk wind, and where the grass was high, leaping to a great height. It was a grand sight. We heard that many settlers had lost house and crop by recent fire. We spent two weeks in Ontario, which was not sufficient to see it thoroughly, but our visit was cut short by an early fall of snow. We visited some farms near Toronto, on one of which we saw stumps extracted by an ingenious machine. Two men and a boy and a pair of light horses were pulling up large pine stumps expeditiously. These stumps are not ripe for pulling for seven or eight years after the trees are cut; and in passing through the Province the patches of land under stumps and the snake rail fences were the strangest features. We visited Guelph, and were kindly entertained by Messrs. McCrae, natives of that place, and several other gentlemen. This is one of the best-farmed districts of Canada, the stock of cattle on several farms being exceptionally good. The chief attraction here was the Ontario School of Agriculture and Model Farm, an excellent institution, partly supported by Government. They have at present 88 pupils, and have had to refuse many applications for want of accommodation. The pupils study and work half time. They are paid for their labor according to industry and ability, and it is possible for an active lad to make the payments for work nearly cover the charges of the school. We were shown over the farm by the Professor of Agriculture, Mr. Brown, a Scotchman. We saw a fine field of turnips tested to average 20 tons per imperial acre. 10 or 12 sorts of swedes had been tried. Experiments were also being made with different varieties of wheat. The pastures were sown out with clover and timothy, and were fairly good, but rather patchy in places. The land is a good, deep, gravelly loam, heavier than similar land here, and not so red in color; some parts were rather soft and heavy, but clean and in good order. The stock included good specimens of Shorthorns, Hereford, Devon, Polled Angus, Galloway, and Ayrshire cattle; and of Southdown, Lothwold, and Leicester sheep, a good many of the animals having been imported from this country. Several of the horses were very nearly pure Clydesdale. They are at present carrying on experiments in cattle feeding with animals of different breeds, and test the increase of live weight on the scales from time to time. Professor Brown expects each animal to gain 2 lbs per head daily. He has found it profitable to reduce the allowance of roots to 30 and 40 lbs daily, and allow a larger quantity of grain, say 6 to 10 lbs, according to circumstances. He has tried steaming and chopping all the food, but found the stock do equally well on the raw food. In experimenting with various forms and kinds of food he found that pigs made most progress on peas supplied whole, although a considerable proportion seemed to pass through the animals undigested. The results of these experiments, as well as a general report of the affairs of the school and farm are published annually, and form an interesting and instructive volume. We saw parties of students engaged on various farm work, attending stock, and thrashing out experimental lots of grain. We think this is a valuable institution and worthy of imitation in this country. We visited several farms in this district. At Mr. Stones' we saw some very good shorthorn stock and Cotswold sheep. At Mr. McCrae's, we saw good turnips and a nice herd of Galloways, including some of the principal prize winners at Ottawa. At Mr. Hobson's farm we saw some excellent shorthorns. Mr. Hobson feeds a good many cattle, buying half fat cattle in December and January, and feeding till June. He allows 12 to 15 lbs meal daily and 60 lbs roots. He also feeds off 400 lambs on rape, selling them in August at 10s to 12s each, and making them worth 22s to 24s by middle of December. The rape is sown in drills and worked the same as turnips. On this farm of 300 acres, 240 cleared, four men are employed in summer and two in winter, and some extra help at busy seasons. Mr. Hobson estimates the necessary capital for such a farm at $3 per acre. Of course where pedigree stock is kept it is much higher. We visited a farm of 180 acres, all good land except 20 acres, which was for sale at about $13 per acre. It was a nice place, near a railway station. The house was new, had cost $800; and the buildings were fair. Another farm of 200 acres, let at 12s an acre, was considered too dear. The soil was a fair sandy loam on a clay subsoil, intersected by a gravelly ridge. The turnips were a very good crop. The divisions of crop on this farm were as follows: 70 acres hay, 60 acres pasture, 15 turnips, 20 fall wheat, 20 peas, 20 oats. The taxes payable by the tenant were about $13, in addition to eight days' statute road labor. This farm was part of a block of 800 acres for sale at $12 per acre. Near Guelph we saw two farms of 400 acres farmed by two sons of the late Mr. Gerrand, Marchfield. They pay about $200 a year rent and taxes, and are said to be doing well. These seemed very desirable, in a good situation, and were for sale, price $12 to $13 per acre. We passed through part of the Paisley block, a district settled a good many years ago by emigrants from Paisley, few of whom had been brought up to farming. They have, in nearly all cases, been successful, and possess very comfortable residences and tidy, well-managed farms. We next visited Gait, where a large proportion of the people are of Scotch descent. Mr. Cowan, a native of Dumfrieshire, has a good farm of 540 acres in the neighborhood. Mr. Cowan is a member of Parliament, and well known as a breeder of Leicester sheep. We saw a first-rate flock of ewes. He also breeds shorthorns. The land is mostly rolling, a deep sandy loam, and free from stones. We went to Bow Park, near Brantford, where we met an old acquaintance, Mr. John Clay, Jr., of Kerchesters. Bow Park belongs to Mr. George Brown, of Toronto, a gentleman of much spirit and enterprise, who founded the splendid herd of shorthorn cattle there. Mr. Clay had just returned from Chicago, where they had sold 40 head of shorthorns at an average of 60 guineas each, and some Clydesdale horses at handsome prices. After luncheon we inspected the splendid buildings and the stock they contained. There are at present about 340 head of shorthorns and one or two Clydesdale horses on the farm. We first saw a very fine lot of one and two-year-old heifers, including some very stylish animals. We then passed through the stable for 24 horses, the immense barn filled with crop and hay, and root-house underneath. In a shed containing 44 loose boxes we found a splendid collection of cows and heifers of the Oxford, Princess, Duchess, and other famous tribes. Many of the animals were very fine, and had been imported from England at a great expense. Some had just returned from a round of shows, where they had carried all before them. In other sheds we found more cows and heifers and the bull 'Fourth Duke of Clarence', a magnificent bull of great style and substance. Mr. Clay informed us that they found a ready market for their young stock chiefly in the States. Now that Canadian cattle are shut out, they will have to find a market in Canada; but judging from the impetus which has been given to cattle-breeding by the export trade to England, we would expect the home trade to increase and by-and-by pay the proprietors. The importation and breeding of such a class of cattle is calculated to be of untold benefit to the province, and indeed to the whole Dominion. Bow Park estate contains 800 acres of fine sandy land situated in a loop of the Grand River, and grows excellent crops of Indian corn, rye, barley, and oats. A large breadth is cut for hay, and the 150 acres of Indian corn are also cut green and stand in stook till required for stock. The stock consume all the produce of the farm. We drove from Brantford to Paris through a very nice country. On the way we visited a very nice farm of 540 acres, 80 acres in wood, nicely situated and well laid out. The house was fine but buildings inferior. The land was a deep sandy loam, easily cultivated, but not in good order. We saw a 60-acre field of grass sown down five or six years ago, which was the best sward of grass we saw in Canada. This was a most desirable farm, and was for sale. We next went from PARIS TO WOODSTOCK, in Oxford Co., and visited Mr. Donaldson's farm of 300 acres at Zorra. Mr. Donaldson is a native of Cumberland, and had excellent farm buildings and very good turnips. He feeds a good many cattle and gave us some details of expenses and returns. He allowed 60 to 70 lbs turnips, and 8 to 10 lbs meal and bran daily, which he estimated rather low; we thought at 3s a week. His cattle paid 13s per month for grazing without cake, and from 22s to 30s per month for house feeding. He estimates grazing sheep at 3d per week, and wintering at 6d, or 20s 6d per annum. Ewes kept in this way should pay nearly 30s each in wool and lambs. He estimates the cost of fattening sheep in winter at 3d per week, including an allowance of grain. Sheep, like cattle, require to be housed in winter, and do well, if not too crowded; 40 in a lot being sufficient. Sheep in Canada are not affected by scab, foot-rot, or murrain. We stayed a night with Mr. Dunlop, a native of Ayrshire. Mr. Dunlop has his farms let at about 12s per acre. He also owns lands in Dakota, and furnished us with useful information. He estimates the necessary working capital for a farm of 200 acres in Oxford County, where 15 to 20 percent of the land is still under timber, at $40 to $60 per acre, but of course many start with much less. The annual labour bill would amount to 16s to 20s per acre if hired, but on such farms the farmer generally takes an active part in the work. He estimates the cost of raising fall wheat, including rent and taxes, at $75 per acre, and of spring wheat at $50. Barley sometimes pays as well as wheat, but prices are more fluctuating. Oats are only grown for home consumption. We visited a large cheese factory at Strathallan station, recently erected on the best principles. The storing room is placed some 20 feet from the making room, and is connected with it by a tramway. The piggeries are about 80 yards off. The balance of cheese on hand had been sold at 6陆d per lb. At Stratford we met Mr. Ballantyne and visited his factory at Black Creek, 8 miles off. This factory was started in 1864, and was one of the first in the neighborhood. Mr. Ballantyne is largely engaged in the cheese trade, is connected with a good many factories, and is probably as good an authority on cheese making and the cheese trade as we could have met with. He has devoted great attention to the scientific principles of cheese making and overcome the main difficulties which American makers have to contend with. He is of the opinion that in many cases the milk is tainted before it is drawn from the cow, owing to water pasture or other subtle causes which affect an article so susceptible of taint as milk. In dealing with such milk (which is indicated by floating gaseous curd), Mr. Ballantyne sets it at a temperature of 80 degrees; he maintains this temperature and draws off the whey as soon as possible, even at the loss of a little curd, as he holds that he gets rid of much of the taint in the whey and that allowing the whey to remain on the curd simply fixes and increases the taint. He allows the curd to ripen well before going to press during a period of from 1 to 5 hours, which the oxygen of the air brings the curd into proper condition. The fitness of the curd for press is tested on a moderately hot iron. If it is sufficiently ripe it should adhere to the iron and draw out in a stringy fashion. I do not know enough of cheese making to make any remarks of my own on these points, but no doubt many of you can appreciate these hints, which I simply repeat as Mr. Ballantyne stated them. July and August, when the weather is hot, is the most critical season with Canadian cheese makers, and we saw some August cheese made on a principle from tainted milk, which were perfectly sweet. At this factory they receive the milk of 1,000 cows, and make fully a ton of cheese daily. The cows yield most milk in June, some 26,000 lbs daily producing 2,600 to 2,700 lbs cheese. The worst yield is in July. The milk is richest in October, when 8陆 lbs milk will yield 1 lb of cheese. Farmers sending milk to the factories do not as a rule feed their cows highly, and consider $6 per cow a fair return for the season. Mr. Ballantyne said it would not pay them to make good cheese under 6d per lb, and that in consequence of the low prices prevailing for some time, many had fed off their cows. The make of American cheese was therefore short, and would probably continue so for some time. He expected to see prices maintained, and did not think makers of the English cheese would be affected as they had been by American competition for a good few years to come.

Bray's lecture on ""Sir Walter Scott: His Life and Writings"" might fairly be called a very good one, the lower part of the church being nearly filled. The lecturer was warmly received on coming forward, and applause frequently testified during the course of the evening to the interest felt in the subject and appreciation of the able manner in which it was treated. The discourse was, as its title would indicate, a review of the life, character, and works of Scott, with quotations from his works being appropriately introduced at intervals. Referring to the habit of celebrating the anniversary of the birth of the poet Burns, the lecturer expressed his surprise that that of the great novelist was not marked by a special celebration. After reviewing many incidents of the author's life, his habits and manners, his love for Abbotsford, his grand abilities, the manner in which his writings were accomplished, and giving with much effect extracts from them, Mr. Bray went on to speak of the closing scenes of his life when his troubles fell thick on him; contrasting his noble resolve to pay in full the immense debt with which he was saddled, with the manner in which liabilities are so scientifically wiped out by the stair bannister. The strap broke instead of his neck, and thus he escaped. A heavy rain, snow, and hail storm, with thunder and lightning, has been raging all morning.

The rains have caused a rise of nearly two feet in the Chippewa and Eau, which is perceptible at this point, and there is a prospect of the ice moving out of the Dells reservoir and other dams above before the close of the week, leaving the river free for a resumption of raft and boat navigation. The improvement at the mills are about completed, and there is a possibility that several of the establishments having a surplus of logs from last season will commence operations this week.

18830312,historical,storm,"MONTREAL, MONDAY, MARCH 12, WEATHER PREDICTION The weather has been a subject of interest in all ages and climes, and attempts at weather prediction were made at a remote period. The traces of a rude meteorology are found in the unearthed literature of the Babylonians. Indications of a plan of weather forecast are found in the Book of Job. The religious creeds of most ancient peoples were based, to a considerable extent, on dread of the unknown of the air, and not a few of the deities, both of civilized and uncivilized antiquity, were personifications of the conditions or influences of the atmosphere. Among the Greeks and Romans, phenomena had also some approach to scientific treatment. They had a theory of a stated revolution of seasons. But the lack of instruments prevented them and other inquirers from attaining accuracy in their observations. It was not, indeed, until the 17th century that the invention of the barometer and thermometer enabled philosophers to ascertain the weight and temperature of the encircling air. Other discoveries of importance followed and towards the close of the last century considerable progress had been made in the collection of data on which a workable theory of the weather might be based. Mr. Kirwan, utilizing the researches of Mr. Mayer, drew up a table of mean temperatures for all the degrees of latitude between the equator and the pole, first for the land and afterwards for the sea. His treatise was long an authority on the subject, and was a marked advance on the application of rules to weather operations. The daily variations of temperature also occupied his attention and he compiled statistics as to the mean annual quantity of rain. While he was laboring in Ireland, Mr. Cotte was pursuing investigations in France and Franklin was examining the nature of lightning on this continent. Other students and enquirers were busy in other parts of the world, and by the beginning of our own century a large mass of useful information on various questions connected with meteorology had been published in memoirs, transactions and in books. From observations of a great number of years, Messrs. Toaldo and Cotte, though on different grounds, advocated a period of repetition covering nine years. They also gave maxims for prognosticating the weather, based on the phases of the moon. Mr. Kirwan's rules for prediction were based on observations which extended from 1777 to 1789. He had found, for instance, that when there had been no storm before or after the vernal equinox, the ensuing summer was dry in five times out of six; that when a storm happened from an easterly point on the 19th, 20th or 21st of May, the succeeding summer was dry four times out of five, and so on. He found that in 41 years there were 6 wet springs, 22 dry and 13 variable; 20 wet summers, 10 dry and variable; 11 wet autumns, 11 dry and variable, each season being counted as wet when it had two wet months. Of a series of maxims, of which the truth was said to have been established by long observation, the following are examples: A moist autumn, with a mild winter, is followed by a cold, dry spring, retarding vegetation; a rainy summer generally precedes a severe winter; cranes and birds of passage early in autumn augur a severe winter; violent storms or great rains bring on crises that produce an equable temperature for some months; a rainy winter predicts a sterile year; a noted storm-centre is generally preceded by great banks of cirro-stratus. Since these rules for foretelling the weather were confidently recommended, nearly three generations of meteorologists have devoted their attention to the subject, and yet we still, notwithstanding our vendors, Johnstons and Wiggin's, have no trustworthy scheme of weather prognostication embracing long periods of time. We should be sorry to think, nevertheless, that no advance has been made towards the formation of a rational and reliable system of seasonal forecast. The success which has attended research into the influence of sunspots, when at their maximum and minimum, gives reason to hope that continued investigation will reveal causes of weather phenomena as to which we are now in the dark. Prof. Maury says, """"the prime object was to gain a daily prospectus of the atmosphere over the country as it actually was, and as it would be seen if a photographic view of it, so to speak, could be taken."""" And, as he adds, """"the simultaneous method, when announced, seemed so natural and simple that we might have wondered that any other was ever attempted."""" The old so-called synchronous method had regard only to local time, and thus much of the value of the observations was lost. By the simultaneous plan, all the observers read their instruments at the same actual moment. In September, 1873, an International Meteorological Congress met at Vienna to institute researches and arrive at some scheme of common action. The simultaneous system was in consequence extended to the entire field of weather investigation, an arrangement of which the late General Myer had already pointed out the expediency. Records of uniform observations then began to be kept by the various weather bureaus, from Japan to Ireland, and from Newfoundland to Alaska. On the 1st of July, 1875, was first issued a printed bulletin containing such daily international and simultaneous reports, and the issue has since been continued, a copy being furnished to each observer. The cooperation of the world's naval and merchant fleets was next sought, and by the end of the year 1879 the entire force engaged in observation numbered 500 persons. The usefulness of such a cosmopolitan weather service, an enterprise for which the U.S. authorities deserve the thanks of civilization, can hardly be overestimated. The object in view, as Prof. Maury says, was to study the atmosphere as a unit. """"Nature's forces respect no national frontiers; and, if their mighty play is to be watched by science, its observational corps must be expanded to cover every accessible part of the globe."""" Some of the results of this combined research are very remarkable. In examining the data of 20 months, Prof. Loomis found that in that time 28 storm centres had travelled eastward across the Rocky Mountains, having scaled that barrier as easily as a steamship overrides a wave. In July, 1878, the Signal Office at Washington began to publish regularly a daily weather chart of all the observations taken simultaneously in the northern hemisphere, which brings """"within easy comprehension of the student's eye"""" the atmospheric phenomena of the whole field of research. Among the questions of which the solution is sought by these charts are """"the translation of cyclones from the Asiatic waters over the North Pacific Ocean to the Pacific slopes of the United States and the kindred question of the transatlantic passage of American storms to western Europe."""" The great highway of the chief atmospheric currents on this continent begins on the Pacific and extends eastward. Hence the urgent need of a series of """"floating observatories"""" in the North Pacific. The cyclones of that ocean recurve from the Asiatic Coast and follow the warm current of Japan (the Kuro Siwo), which is the congener of the Gulf Stream and is a natural storm-channel. In like manner European weather is shaped from the Atlantic and hence the desirability of trustworthy regular reports from points in the Atlantic two hundred miles or more from land. One such report, it is claimed, would be worth, for the purposes of storm prediction, more than dozens of continental reports. The value of such reports is illustrated by the cold, wet summer which caused so much distress in Great Britain in 1879, and of which farmers might have been forewarned had there been international reports from Iceland and the Faroe Islands. In observing the clouds, which Prof. Maury calls """"Nature's weather-guides,"""" and which are unerring monitors of every weather change; not so much the shape of clouds of freezing or frozen vapor, at great elevations, and recognizable by their thread-like delicacy as well as their altitude. The main body, forming the familiar cumulus, is the omen of impending disturbance and those whose time is spent outdoors may soon learn to interpret their meaning and forecast the changes which they indicate. It is, however, only by the application of a comprehensive simultaneous system that the full significance of such phenomena can be ascertained. To forecast the coming seasons, it can only be possible when the network of observing stations is enlarged so as to include a vast expanse of ocean as well as of land. """"The northern hemisphere, at least,"""" says Prof. Maury, """"must be visited with a thorough system of observations."""" NOT MUCH OF A STORM AFTER ALL ROCHESTER, March 10 The deciding games in the pool tournament were played tonight. Albert Frey took the first prize, John B. Suessinger the second, Samuel Knight the third, and George B. Sutton the fourth. Ottawa, March 11 The weather today has been cold, cloudy and gusty. Tonight the wind is higher than it has been all day, but there has been no approach to a storm, though snow fell to a considerable depth during Saturday night. Some excitement was created yesterday afternoon, when telegrams were received stating that severe gales and a tidal wave had occurred on the coast of Nova Scotia and the eastern coast of the United States, and, in consequence, Wiggins' stock went up, but it had a downward tendency tonight. Mr. Wiggins claims Saturday's snowstorm as part of his great blow. IN THE EASTERN TOWNSHIPS AN EARTHQUAKE Waterville, Que., March 11 The severest storm known for years is in progress today. Snow began falling yesterday afternoon, and continued unabated through the night. The wind has been blowing a gale all day, and the snow is piled almost mountains high, making traffic of all kinds absolutely impossible. It will take some days to clear the snow blockade, so that business may resume its normal condition. The mayor is engaging a large force of men to open the streets. Between 10 and 11 o'clock two distinct shocks of earthquake were felt, the wave passing from east to west, and causing great alarm. The country roads will be impassable for days. The mails between here and Magog are to be carried by team, trains being cancelled. In the meantime, the Central Vermont and South Eastern railways are making almost superhuman efforts to get their lines open. Wiggins was regarded as rank on Saturday, and today he is looked upon as indeed a prophet of the prophets. St. Johns, Que., March 11 There was a heavy snowstorm last night and part of today, the wind approaching a gale at times. Two shocks of earthquake, following each other, were felt at 10:57 this morning, and a third at 11:07. During the first hopes were entertained of the prospects of a new railway station, for which Prof. Wiggins would receive the thanks of the whole community. The storm has abated, and it is gradually growing colder. S., March 10 The day dawned with an overcast sky but light southwest wind and mild temperature. It continued in this state until shortly after noon, when the breeze shifted over to the southeast quarter and gradually grew in force. A few minutes after 1 o'clock the storm-signal was up at the Citadel station, and people then began to prepare for a storm. Many still stuck to the belief that it would be only an ordinary March blow, but the majority began to doubt this, and made preparations for what they expected would soon turn out to be a fulfillment of Wiggins' warning. Steamers and sailing vessels in the docks were secured to their wharves with extra hawsers, and merchandise in places of insecurity was removed to higher and safer quarters. No remarkable change occurred throughout the following two hours, but about 4 o'clock the wind quickened, gaining strength, light short distance when the storm was at its height, between 8 and 9, but pulled up before getting into danger. The steamer Sarmatian, from Liverpool, and steamer Newfoundland, from St. John's, Nfld., which arrived this morning, report having felt the blow only lightly, and were caused no anxiety. The Gloucester fishing schooner Admiral, which put in today to land a sick man, had to lay-to during the gale, which struck her with great violence. MATCH at CURLING BILLYVILLE, March 10 The fourth of the games of curling for the rich medal was played yesterday afternoon, and resulted in Caver of the Canadians by 18 to 8. CINCINNATI, March 10 At the pigeon shooting match between Carver and Bogardus, a hundred birds, purse of $100, there was a heavy snowstorm and high wind during the shooting. Bogardus scored 74 and Carver 81. A remedy for those afflicted with any chronic disease of the stomach, rain and hail commenced to fall, and the cloud overhead grew ominously dark. Half an hour later the wind had increased doubly in strength, and rain and hail were falling quite heavily. The following two hours this state of affairs continued, the breeze increasing to a gale and howling overhead. Fear then became greater among the wharf owners and proprietors of property on the water line, and great excitement was created. At seven o'clock, the ferry steamers to Dartmouth ceased their trips, the last one occurring four times the usual time and being made with great difficulty. From that hour until nine o'clock the gale blew with terrible fury, causing the vessels in the docks to strain their fastenings and almost tear from them and drive into the harbor. Only one, however, is reported to have broken her moorings, the schooner Four Brothers, owned by William Brown lying at the Market Wharf with a cargo of potatoes and oats. Between eight and nine o'clock, in a violent blast of wind, the vessel suddenly tore from her bow hawser and swinging around, struck the city wharf on the other side of the dock with great violence, smashing her bowsprit and tearing some planking from the wharf. With some difficulty she was again secured with extra chains and safely moored between the two wharves. The tide rose during the blow to the highest point known here since the Saxby gale. At eight o'clock it was nearly on a level with the wharves and at nine, when at its highest, the sea washed over in many places, and barrels of flour, meal and other merchandise in exposed places were swept about, but no serious damage, it is thought, has resulted. The steamers in port held well to their fastenings and weathered the blow without injury. The mail steamer Sardinian delayed sailing on the storm being observed coming on. Considerable fear was felt for the safety of the steamer Newfoundland, which sailed from St. John's, Nfld., for this port last Tuesday and was due here today. Between eight and nine o'clock, when the storm was at its highest, the barometer, which in the morning registered 30.40, and at two in the afternoon 30.10, stood at 29.33, and was yet falling rapidly. The wind was then blowing at the rate of thirty-seven miles an hour and apparently gaining in velocity. About nine, however, it calmed suddenly down and the property owners and people began to be more confident, but the breeze again sprung up from a more easterly direction, though not with as great strength as before. The tide is now falling and no more heavy weather is expected tonight, but in the morning, it is said by old fishermen and observers of the weather, with the incoming tide the wind will rise again and blow with equal if not greater violence. The fishing schooners Kuntford, Josie M., Calderwood and Magic, of Gloucester, are reported at western ports of the Province awaiting the passing of the storm period predicted. Halifax, N.S., March 11, 1:30 a.m. At this hour there is a slight breeze blowing from the southeast, but it appears at times to increase somewhat in strength, and then subside. The high tide has gone completely down and the vessels ride easily in their docks. The steamer Sardinian, for Liverpool with the weekly mail, still remains in port. The effects of last evening's storm, reports of the violence of which are now coming in from all parts of Nova Scotia, prove it to have been not so serious as was expected. At the south end of the city part of an old wharf on which the Howell tin-dry was situated was blown away, but the other wharves and property on the water line suffered only slightly. The damage to vessels in the harbor was quite bad, and the heaving up of a few planks in wharves makes up all the other damage yet reported. Vessels at anchor in the harbor rode out the gale without injury. The barometer fell to the highest point known here since the Saxby gale.

old, threw a bomb in the cafe of the Hotel Terminus at the St. Lazare railway station this evening, The bomb exploded in the middle of the room and wounded twenty persons, An instrumental concert began in the cafe, which is on the ground floor of the hotel, at 8 o'clock, Shortly before 9 o'clock a pale, thin young man with a light pointed beard paid for a drink which he had taken at a table in the middle of the room and started to leave, When near the door he turned suddenly, drew a bomb from his coat and threw it towards a group of persons who had sat next to him, The bomb struck an electric light fixture, then fell on a marble table and exploded, The great hotel and station were rocked by the shock, The mirrors, windows and doors were blown to atoms, The ceiling and floors were rent and the walls were cracked, A dense, offensive smoke filled the cafe for a few minutes, and in the obscurity Breton escaped, When the smoke cleared away five persons were found wounded and 15 slightly injured, The bomb had been filled with bullets and rough pieces of iron, which had riddled the furniture and walls and inflicted most of the wounds, After leaving the cafe the bomb thrower started down the street on a run, Three policemen had just passed in an omnibus when the explosion occurred, They were going on duty and jumped to the street the moment they saw the fugitive, The young man turned on them as they called to him to stop and fired five shots, Policeman Poisson fell badly wounded in the side, Policemen Lenoir and Bigot, however, continued the pursuit and, with the

and age, The prefect of police, M. Laurent, chief secretary to M. Dubois, minister of the interior, and several other high officials, were summoned to the station, and the examination of the prisoner was begun, Police Commissary Gavrel taking the evidence, Meanwhile the sound of the explosion, the smoke and the cries of the wounded had attracted a great crowd to the Hotel Terminus, Doctors Sereno, Bouille and Thysun offered their services and dressed the wounds of the injured, At 11 o'clock only an incomplete list of the injured could be obtained, It was as follows: M. Herdere, both legs pierced by bullets and pieces of iron; Mine. Leblanc, shin bone fractured; Mine. Leblanc's brother, ear split and bruised; unidentified man, wounded in the intestines by a flying piece of marble; Messrs. Danne, Vanhest, Poquet, Fonbert, Raymond and Laustan, cut or torn by fragments of marble or glass, The United Press correspondent was admitted to the Rue de Moscou police station shortly after the arrest, Breton sat handcuffed between two policemen, He showed the effects of his hasty flight and tussle with the police, Otherwise he looks calm and comfortable, The removal of his outside coat revealed a collarless flannel shirt and the general garb of a working man, In his pockets the police had found a pair of brass knuckles, a dagger, a Swedish knife, a six chambered revolver, a gold half Louis, two franc pieces, eleven cents and a small silver locket containing a lock of brown hair tied with a ribbon, At first he refused to talk, telling the police that it was their business to find out who he was, After giving his name and age he again became silent, Eventually he added that he was a cabinetmaker and had arrived in Paris from Marseilles this morning, """"Yes, I am an Anarchist,"""" he exclaimed, irately, in response to reiterated questions, """"and the more of the bourgeois I killed the better it would please me,"""" Paris, February 12, An Anarchist named Boisson, one of the many arrested during the recent police raids on Anarchist haunts, was placed on trial today and convicted of having explosives in his possession, The judge sentenced him to four months' imprisonment Boisson stood in a defiant attitude while sentence was being pronounced upon him, As the judge concluded, the prisoner, who had a large piece of bread in his hand, drew back his arm and threw the bread at the judge, The missile struck the judge on the nose, As Boisson threw the bread he shouted, addressing his remarks to the court and attendants, """"You are a crowd of pigs, We will blow you all up, Long live Anarchy,"""" The act of the prisoner created great excitement in court, many of those present thinking the piece of bread was a bomb, Fragments of bomb indicate that it was a tin box, perhaps a sardine box, the explosive contained a chloritic powder, A man who saw the capture of Breton in the street described it thus: """"As Policeman Poisson fell, Breton stumbled; but to save himself, and almost instantly, fired again at the crowd of pursuers behind the other policeman, A woman sank dangerously wounded to the pavement Breton continued to flourish his revolver after he had emptied it, A policeman struck him with a sabre and Breton fell, but only to rise and struggle fiercely when the policeman laid hands on him, It was only with difficulty that the police prevented the crowd from lynching him, The police say that four persons, who were passing the Hotel Terminus when the explosion occurred, were severely injured, One of them may die before morning, FILLING ASSEMBLIES, A Heavy Fight Over the House of Lords About to Begin, GAUNTLET TO BE THROWN Down by the National Liberal Federation at Its Meeting on Thursday Mr. Gladstone Sanctions It, LONDON, February 12, The House of Commons reassembled today, Sir Edward Grey, parliamentary secretary of the Foreign office, in reply to a question, said British merchantmen enjoyed the same facilities at Rio Janeiro as were had by the vessels of other nations, The Government would neglect no opportunity to secure for the commerce of Great Britain the same advantages as were accorded to other countries, The business transacted today was entirely formal, The members expect that tomorrow the Government will make a declaration rejecting the amendments made by the House of Lords to both the Parish councils and Employers' Liability bills, A meeting of the Cabinet was held at the official residence of Mr. Gladstone in Downing street prior to the reassembling of the House of Commons, It is stated that Mr. Gladstone proposes to drop the Parish Councils bill and the Employers' Liability bill and make an appeal to the country within a month, After the Cabinet council was concluded today the executive committee of the National Liberal Federation obtained permission to put a resolution before the annual meeting of the Federation on Thursday declaring that no further mischievous meddling of the House of Lords shall detract from the work of charter reform, which the Representative House is authorized to carry out, It is reported that the delegates will be asked to approve a resolution declaring that the continuance of a house of hereditary legislators has become intolerable and that the House of Lords has been allowed to exist too long, The Duke of Devonshire, leader of the Liberal-Unionists, has called a meeting of his parliamentary party for Thursday, This meeting will be asked to decide whether or not the party shall support Lord Salisbury against the Commons, Joseph Chamberlain, Liberal-Unionist leader in the Commons, will advise the peers to surrender rather than provoke the decisive conflict, The Daily Chronicle, commenting on the re-opening of Parliament, remarks that """"There could scarcely be a more humiliating position for a popular assembly than is the case in Great Britain with the House of Commons belittled and insulted by a survival of medievalism which exists for no other reason under heaven but to afford a cover for every anti-popular reactionary and despotic sentiment,"""" The Liberal and Radical union at its meeting today passed a resolution denying the right of the House of Lords to return to the country the bills passed by the House of Commons, The resolution also condemned the institution of the Upper House as a danger to the State, LONDON, February 12, the meeting of the National Liberal federation of Portsmouth opened today, Robert Spence Watson, the president, said in his introductory address that he rejoiced in the recent conduct of the peers, They had acted in the manner best calculated to bring to the front the question not of mending them, but of ending them, The day for forgiving the iniquities of the peers, even if they should repent, had gone, Loud applause greeted this declaration of principles, COLD WEATHER, That Is What the Probs Say of Today's Weather, Meteorological Office, Toronto, Ont, February 12, 11 p.m., The storm which was developing in the Lower Mississippi valley last night has divided into two parts, one moving to the lake region and the other to the middle Atlantic coast, Gales with heavy snow are prevalent in Ontario and decidedly colder weather is general in the Dominion, Minimum and maximum temperatures: Esquimalt, 32, 42;

Well, there is a better feeling, The trouble was that the financiers and bankers had lost confidence, and the same state of affairs existed all over Europe, but I could see before leaving London that a vast improvement had taken place, Confidence in fact has been in a great measure restored, and you will readily understand that this cannot but have a first rate effect upon Canada as well as upon her interests in the old land, """"In regard to the object of his trip to London, he remarked that the general belief was that the subsidy to the Canadian-Australian line would be granted by the Imperial authorities in due course, """"They had been doing all in their power to educate the public mind of Britain to the vital importance of such a service, not only to the colonies, but to the Empire at large, """"You have no doubt had valuable assistance while in London,"""" he was asked, """"Yes, Sir Charles Tupper has nobly seconded my efforts and I am likewise under great obligations to the agents of the Australian governments in London, These gentlemen thoroughly understand the situation both from a colonial and imperial point of view, and you Canadians should be proud in having such a man as the High Commissioner to look after Canadian interests on the other side of the water, """"Mr. Huddart is also much interested in the success of a fast At",still contain unrelevant stuff at the end
18950819,historical,storm,"SATURDAY'S DELUGE The Heaviest Rainstorm Seen in Montreal for Years BURSTING OF A SEWER Floods Many Houses in Ste. Hypollite Lane Much Damage Done Throughout Ontario The heaviest thunderstorm of the season broke over the city on Saturday night People had begun to remark upon the great freedom we were enjoying from heavy storms this summer, but the one on Saturday night made up for all deficiencies It broke about 9 o'clock, and for a couple of hours the heavens were let loose It thundered, it lightened, it rained, it hailed, it blew At the height of the storm it thundered almost incessantly, and flash followed flash of lightning with such vividness and quickness that the mountain was in an almost perpetual glow, and the objects upon it were as clearly visible as at noonday Some of the peals of thunder were terrific, and one particularly, which seemed to be directly over the corner of Mercury and St. Catherine streets, was so loud as to cause the occupant of a store in that neighborhood to rush out of the building, through the blinding rain, across the street, under the impression that the structure was going to collapse The building, however, withstood the shock, and in due time the scared persons again took shelter under the cover of their own houses Probably the most remarkable portion of the storm was the heavy downpour of rain, as well as hail It did not come down even in big drops; it came down in sheets so dense that it was scarcely possible to see the road It gave the streets one of the most thorough scavengings they had for many a long day They simply became watercourses for the time being, and any refuse that was upon them was swept along like chaff before a whirlwind Pedestrianism was entirely out of the question, and all who had failed to reach home before the storm broke for once blessed the man who adapted electricity to locomotion There is an adage to the effect that """"It is all ill wind that blows nobody good,"""" and the carter came in for his share of what benefits there were in the shape of fares Altogether the storm was the heaviest that has struck the city for some time The wind blew 40 miles an hour when the storm struck the city, and during the twenty-four hours traveled 175 miles The rainfall on Saturday, from about 8 to 10 o'clock (midnight), was 1.6 inches, and during yesterday 2.21 inches of rain fell in the city It is conjectured that the storm entered Canada at Detroit and swept westward across Ontario, doing much damage, considerable damage, but there was very evidently no loss of life The heavy rain on neighborhoods resulted Saturday evening in the flooding of the cellars and lower parts of the houses on St. Hypollite Lane, at or near Tularin street Shortly after 6 o'clock the heavy downfall of rain compelled a large number of the inhabitants to remain indoors, but to their surprise they found water creeping through the flooring and within a very few moments not only were their cellars flooded, but their furniture was seen floating in the sitting rooms, and before the inmates realized their danger they were standing in from two to three feet of water Severe excitement was occasioned when an invalid named French was taken out from No. 12 Hypollite Lane At first, it was rumored that the gentleman had been overtaken by the rising water and before he could be rescued he was drowned, this rumor fortunately was without foundation There are eleven houses in the upper part of St. Hypollite Lane, and not one escaped damage from the flood Several of the householders stated to the press last evening that they intended leaving the city The flooding of cellars is a phenomenon in many parts of the city The Montreal Street Railway Company were also the victims of Saturday night's storm The rain fell so heavily on St. Lawrence streets, while, before the rain had stopped, it piled up about two feet The service was delayed for over an hour, but a huge gang of men were soon sent to the scene and in a short time the line was cleared Solmer Park was not the pleasant place to be in during the storm, but the people there were better off than many others Sure the rain sprayed through the skylights and the wind swept it in from the west side, but it was not until the wind veered round to the south and blew clouds of spray through the immense auditorium that the people began to get uncomfortable It seemed striking to see people listening to a concert, for the program went on, with umbrellas over their heads, and startling peals of thunder lent an effect to the musical times that was noteworthy St. Helens Island and the rain-swept river would be recalled at times with remarkable distinctness A momentary flash of Victoria bridge by the lightning produced a thrill that Mr. Sparrow, no doubt, would give a good deal to be able to counteract the stage Occasions like this furnish views of the city which few dream of For a time last evening the rain was almost as heavy as on the evening preceding There were a large number of people who had reason to abuse this sudden storm and say hard things about the weather generally These were the passengers on an electric car, in the close vicinity of Alwater Avenue, that went off the track last evening, due, it is said, to the heavy rain washing the grit onto the track Matters had just started to get interesting when another and yet another car came up behind and in a short time there was quite a procession Considering the weather, the passengers evidently thought it the best policy to stay in the car and in a great many cases, sad to say, used violent language There was nothing to be done, however, but wait, and wait they did until about half an hour afterwards the car was placed again on the track and all was well again One result of the extremely heavy wind which preceded the storm was the breaking of a new and very heavy looking telegraph pole on Notre Dame street, near McCord The heavy timber was snapped as a twig, and had it not been for the quantities of telegraph wire which formed quite a netting, the pole would in all probability have crashed through a photographic studio, a not very substantial building in the vicinity The Storm up West Detroit, Mich., August 17 During a thunderstorm about noon today, lightning struck the United Presbyterian church, in process of erection at the corner of Grand River and Alexander avenues It killed one of the workmen and injured half a dozen others more or less seriously Simcoe, Ont., August 17 During a severe thunderstorm this afternoon, John Johnson, son of Humphrey Johnson, a farmer in the Ninth concession of Malahide, was killed by lightning

of here, were struck by lightning, and were completely destroyed together with the whole season's crops No insurance, it having expired but a week ago A heavy gale of wind accompanied it and did great havoc with trees, but more especially at Krieau, a summer resort situated south of here on Lake Erie, where all the tents occupied by campers were blown down and several yachts and sailing boats were driven from their moorings Picton, Ont., August 17 At five o'clock this evening a very heavy storm broke over this town The rain fell in torrents, accompanied by sharp lightning, some hail and a terrific wind, which tore up pieces of sidewalk, uprooted and broke shade and fruit trees, and partly unroofed some barns in the vicinity As yet no serious accidents have been reported The apple crop

he has now enclosed it with a high fence and ordered that admission to the hill and castle ruins shall be only by ticket Mobs of indignant villagers tore down the fence as fast as it was built and burnt the notice boards, and a Welsh member, who passed through the district today, tells me the expectation is that a force of Chester police will be brought out to coerce the crowd, which is quite resolved to resist Keir Hardie, who sails today for a lecture tour in America, deserves no attention from labor leaders or anybody else, and will probably get what he deserves John Burns really has something in him, but Hardie is a mere empty fraud, who won notoriety in the Commons only by wearing dirty old clothes and a coster's cap, instead of a hat of parliamentary tradition This would have been forgiven as a part of the general scheme of securing an audience if there had been anything genuine behind his affectations, and people tolerantly waited to see if there was, but in vain, a mere blatherskite, pure and simple Gladstone now issues a post-card judgment on some book or ethical problem submitted to him nearly every day, and, sad to say, the papers have taken to printing them in very small type in obscure corners One today contains the statement that he is personally grateful to science for all that it has done and is doing, but Christianity stands in no need of it, and is as able now as ever to hold its own ground A curious report is afloat that Swinburne is about to be made poet laureate and a friend who ought to be well informed says that it has always been a mistake to suppose that the Queen opposed him so strongly The great opposition, according to this account, came from Gladstone, and was based chiefly on personal grounds The appointment is, however, so strictly a royal prerogative and the Queen has so many things that the story seems to have a wishful thinking quality Aim I am in no doubt that Swinburne will get it after all London, August 18 -It is reported that the Marquis of Lorne has written a drama dealing with Scottish historical events, and that it has been accepted by one of London’s managers, who will produce it before the close of the present year The question of the development of mining in British Columbia is at present attracting much attention in financial circles in the city, and it is probable that several mining experts will visit the province in the autumn If the reports made by them of the result of their investigations shall be favorable a large influx of British capital may be expected Despite the heavy rain storms which occurred during the entertainment of Emperor William of Germany by the Earl of Lonsdale, his Majesty's visit was a decided success On the 12th instant the Kaiser shot fifty brace of grouse The Emperor greatly astonished his suite by appearing in an ordinary shooting suit instead of the theatrical attire that he wears on his gunning expeditions in Germany This costume consists of a braided tunic, high boots, a Tyrolean hat adorned with feathers This, however, his Majesty discarded on this occasion, having ordered from a London tailor a couple of hunting suits, grayish brown in color, and of a pattern similar to the Prince of Wales' shooting dress The Kaiser, it is said, has decided to adopt this costume for hunting, and his example will be followed by a majority of his suite His Majesty, during his visit to England, gave grave offense to Nazrulla Khan, the Afghan prince, who has for some time past been in England, by failing to ask the Prince to meet him, and by not sending him any message or letter The position of the Prince excites public curiosity It is known that he has received an almost unlimited number of hints from the Chinese government to leave England, and that she has told him that he need not again visit any member of the Royal family, and so Nazrulla never leaves the grounds of Dorchester House, where he is staying The governments of the countries also which it was Nazrulla's intention to visit have all positively refused to receive him The refusal of the Sultan of Turkey has been made public In it the Sultan states that, in compliance with a request of M. Nelidoll, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, he cannot receive the son of the Ameer if he should carry out his intention to visit Turkey MISSIONARY MASSACRE The Commission Arrives at Ku Cheng - Several Arrests Made Kiangsi, August 17 Mr. W. Minefield, a former British consul at Yichang, Mr. J. Courtenay Nixon, the United States consul at this place; Ensign Adam Waldos, of the American warship Detroit, and other members of the commission appointed to investigate into the massacre of missionaries at Ku Cheng, arrived at that place A number of important arrests have already been made in connection with the outrages The natives at Ku Cheng are quiet, but considerable alarm was created among them by the arrival of the commission and its escort of one hundred Chinese braves New York, August 17 -The Herald's special says: From the Chinese minister in reference to the recent massacres of missionaries, declared they were on this, as on previous occasions, mainly the work of ruffians, who had availed themselves of the exceptional circumstances in order to work mischief and loot property in the confusion which ensued In the town of Cheng-Tu, for instance, it is notorious that bad characters, who have their lairs in the neighboring mountains, had come into the town on the lookout for robbery, somewhat in a similar manner to that which prevails now and then in outlandish places in Western America, where rowdies ride in broad daylight and loot the banks With regard to the special case of the missionaries, it was to be noted that the German mission had not been attacked Thus the matter probably was to be traced to a special local concentration of circumstances and not to any outbreak of feeling against the missionaries as such His Excellency himself had been a mandarin in the Southern district three years ago, and he could vouch for the fact that the inhabitants treated foreigners, missionaries included, with greater regard than was usual among themselves But, the circumstances had been exceptional of late The Chinese had suffered defeat, and a sore feeling prevailed in consequence, which the foreigners, and the missionaries in particular, had not always made due allowance for; but, on the contrary, now and then had scarcely taken the trouble to conceal their poor opinion of the natives This had naturally led to ill-feeling, which the violent characters had done their best to foment COMPARATIVELY FAIR And Comparatively Cool Weather Promised for Today Toronto, August 18, 11 p.m. Pressure is comparatively low from the lakes to the Atlantic and highest over the west and northwest States Since Saturday showers and thunder storms have been general in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime provinces while in the Northwest the weather has been fine Minimum and maximum temperatures: Calgary, 38, 60; Medicine Hat, 34, 70; Quebec City, 38, 60; Winnipeg, 44, 66; Parry Sound, 62, 68; Toronto, 68, 78; Montreal, 61, 78; Quebec, 60, 70; Halifax, 51, 71 Lake Northwest to westerly winds; fresh during the day; fine and comparatively cool Upper St. Lawrence Fresh westerly to northwesterly winds; generally fair and comparatively cool Lower St. Lawrence and Gulf Light to strong, southwesterly to westerly winds; cloudy to fair, with some local showers or thunder storms Maritime Moderate to fresh winds; mostly south and west; showers or thunder storms in many places; Manitoba Light to moderate winds; fine, a little warmer in most places",

Commodore Charles H. Levin, of the St. Lawrence Yacht Club, is dead. He fell a victim to the storm which swept over the Montreal district on Saturday afternoon, and he will be regretted by all who knew him, for """"Charley"""" Levin was one of the best loved men in Montreal. Young, active and interested in all sporting events, an enthusiastic soldier, a loving husband and a kind father, his loss will be felt by many people, not in Montreal alone, but throughout Canada, from all of whom will go forth the prayer that his widow may receive that consolation from on High which it is not possible for her to obtain on earth. The sad occurrence took place on Saturday afternoon, which had been selected as one of the dates for the sailing matches of the St. Lawrence Yacht Club. The sky looked threatening all the forenoon and early afternoon, but with true British pluck the members determined that they would not be deterred by the weather. They loved their sport for its own sake, and were not to be deterred by such obstacles as a choppy sea and a cloudy sky. Accordingly at 3:40 p.m. the boom of the gun gave the warning to prepare for the race, and five minutes later THE YACHTS STARTED OFF in the scheduled race for class A, 30-foot boats, in the following order: Rita, Valda, Coquette, Molly Bawn, Eagle, Chaperone and Frolic. All went well for some time. Rounding the first buoy it was a toss-up between the Eagle and the Valda for preeminence, and they got well up towards Pointe Claire. When they were halfway between the upper light and the Châteauguay buoy the storm broke without warning, and quicker than it takes to write the words the magnificent fleet of yachts was scattered and engulfed in the lake waters, which had by this time become a raging sea. The wind blew with cyclonic force, the rain and hail fell in torrents, and, to use the words of one of the onlookers from the shore, the lake was covered as by a dark curtain, just as if an exciting scene in a drama had concluded and the drop had been rung down. The hurricane struck the yachts at the same time, for none had prepared for the storm, although old yachtsmen said yesterday that no one should have ventured out with such a threatening sky. The Chaperone, the Valda and the Eagle felt the effects of the storm at about the same time. THE EAGLE WAS THE FIRST TO GO DOWN. Laden heavily with pig iron ballast, she was unable to stand the strain of the unusually heavy seas, which were larger than have been seen on the lake for thirty years, and she consequently went down like a log. Her crew consisted of Messrs. Charles H. Levin, George and Carl Gabley, Robert J. Boss, J. Simmons and D. Robertson. Immediately there was a rush for the life belts, but Captain Levin kept his head, as he always did, and he was the last to leave the yacht. He was accompanied by Mr. Simmons, who behaved as a brave man should do under such circumstances. The crew were buffeted by the waves and struck by the hail, but the storm was too severe to allow assistance to be given them from the shore, and nearly half an hour elapsed before assistance could be rendered. Then was seen one of the most heroic acts ever witnessed in the Montreal district. Mr. A., was out on the lake in his naphtha yacht, the """"Idle Hour,"""" with a party of ladies. Just as soon as the storm broke he made for the shore, landed his fair passengers, and called for volunteers to assist in the work of rescue, for by that time it was known that the storm had been disastrous and that human beings were struggling for life with the waves, which had, to use the expression of a veteran member of the Yacht Club, assumed the proportions of an Atlantic storm. The request met with an immediate response, Messrs. Lyall Davidson, son of Mr. Justice Davidson; A. J. McCuaig volunteering their services. The task was a heavy one, for it was as much as a little launch could do to battle the waves, which swept her from stem to stern, and once it was feared she would not be able to weather the storm, which had by this time assumed the proportions of a western cyclone. However, the crew were brave men, and knowing that human life was in danger, they risked their own safety in order to rescue the perishing. It was a long and wearying voyage across the lake, and what made it seem longer was the fact that the two large Upper Canada steamers, which were within sounding distance of the victims of the squall, did not launch a lifeboat, or even throw off some of their surplus life buoys. THE FIRST VESSEL MET by the Idle Hour was the Rita, on which were Messrs. C. O. Clarke, T. Church, U. Lucas and W. Clarke. That yacht had been capsized, but, luckily, turned bottom up. Consequently its crew had some support, and they told Mr. Morris to go to the help of those who were worse off than themselves. It was not then possible to see the extremities of the crew of the Eagle, and Mr. Morris accordingly directed his attention to those on board the Chaperone, which floated for about ten minutes, and then her air tanks bursting she, too, sank to the bottom. Three of her men, Messrs. S. Clonston, manager of the Bank of Montreal, the owner of the yacht, B. Bogert and W. S. Clouston, were picked up by the Valda and escorted to the shore. The Frolic and Coquette got their sails down with difficulty and rode out the storm. Capt. Hamilton, the vice commodore of the club, who commanded the Frolic, put out his anchor and threw out buckets and life buoys but was unfortunately unable to render any assistance. The Molly Bawn, which was well handled by Mr. Walter Kavanagh, also rode out the storm. It must have been nearly half-past five o'clock when Mr. Morris and his assistant were able to reach the TRICOLOUR CREW OF THE EAGLE, which had capsized in about thirty feet of water some two and a half miles south of the Pointe Claire boat house wharf. By this time the crew had become much exhausted and it was with difficulty that they were able to maintain themselves above water upon the slight support afforded them by boards and other debris. Mr. Levin was resting upon the debris of the yacht in company with Mr. Simmons. About three minutes before the Idle Hour reached them K. H. Routh, the keeper of the Pointe Claire lighthouse, an old man with but one leg, put out in a flat-bottomed boat in the middle of the storm and rescued Mr. Robert Lucas. What Minor Hate Just Perish by It Upset by a Yacht in a Squall London, July 8. Despatches from Sheerness report a yacht accident. The persons drowned were railway builders, who, with thousands of other excursionists, had gone to the little watering place for a day's sport. The yacht Staunton, licensed to carry sixty passengers, took out thirty of them. When well out the yacht was overwhelmed by a thunderstorm. After the weather cleared the yacht was seen bottom upwards with three men clinging to her. The others had been drowned. An old fish boat, the only craft available, was launched and the three survivors were brought ashore; twelve bodies have been recovered. The three survivors agree that nobody was to blame for the accident, as the suddenness of the squall could not be anticipated. Another from Chicago, July 9. A furious wind and rainstorm swept over the city between five and six o'clock and caught many a craft on Lake Michigan. By the capsizing of the sailing yacht Chesapeake near the life-saving station nine people were thrown into the water and four of them were drowned. The dead are T. Frambolis. Frambolis, Wm. Y., July 8. The Tuxedo tennis tournament of '93 is over and Clarence Hobart, of New York, is champion in both singles. To-day he defeated Edward L. Hall, the previous holder of the title, who had twice won the right to have his name inscribed on the big cup, and thus deprives the latter from adding the trophy to his numerous prizes. GEORGE IN THE STORM The Bohemian Driven Ashore by Saturday's Wind. She Will Leave Tomorrow Morning Latest Arrival in Port. The Richelieu & Ontario Navigation Company's steamer Bohemian, Captain McGrail, whilst on her way down from Kingston met the full force of the storm on Saturday afternoon. About 4:30, when near St. Dominique, the storm was so great as to blow her in on the shore, but fortunately she grounded on a good place and the 25 passengers who were on board at the time were able to reach Montreal by train a few hours later. It is fortunate that the accident did not occur lower down the river, as the rapids are in close proximity to where the Bohemian is now beached. A Gazette reporter saw Mr. Conley last evening, who stated that the Bohemian was not damaged, and would be got off by Tuesday. The steamship Avlona, Captain Baxter, arrived in port yesterday afternoon from Antwerp with a general cargo consigned to R. Rolord & Co. The steamships Sylvia and Petunia have both brought cargoes of coal from Glace Bay consigned to Kingman, Brown & Co. The steamship Lony, Captain Barker, has brought a general cargo from Havre consigned to McLean, Kennedy & Co. The steamship Beaver, Captain Masson, is discharging her general cargo from Gaspe, consigned to J. CAPITALS HEAT TORONTO. Playing Increase for the Western Championship Excelsior and Drumhead Football Zimmerman Still Winning; Baseball and Turf Scene. The oldest inhabitant had just started to tell what he knew in the old days when the boys played lacrosse as was customary, but grey-headed men of the present generation were in the majority, when a black cloud sent down milk-white rain and hail, the opaqueness of which mixed up perspective with oblivion and chaos. But the mild old gentleman of curlicue eye and snowy hirsuteness cared not what happened, and he started to tell the boys that he had seen nothing like it since the patriarchal deluvian days. And then the lightning flashed around in an aimless sort of way as if it wanted to strike the reincarnation of Ananias for a loan, and his audience, who knew enough to come in out of the rain, left him to do the Munchausen act all by his lonesomeness. This is not an exaggeration of a type; he is an absolutely real personality, who believes more than half what he says, and thinks he is several hundred years older than he looks. If you listen to him long enough he will tell you the pile of gold the Inca promised Pizarro was only a tip on the lacrosse match wherein the Aztecs had a mortgage on the thing, having fixed it up in a modern fashion with the Seminoles; he will tell you how the Knewka-pitels beat the Knewtor-on-tos by five goals to two, and feel it as if it happened in the days of the mound builder. And if you don't believe him he will get mad. He is to be found at every lacrosse match, and he was largely present on Saturday. He was there to the extent of about five thousand; the Shamrock Stand was not big enough to hold him and the rising generation of the lacrosse prevaricators found resting places in the trees and the telegraph posts. It was just one of the times when the person who does weather prophesying got square with the doubting public. He told them plainly enough in the morning papers that it was going to be a stormy day and with the natural contrariety of humanity everybody left their umbrellas at home, and accordingly got wet. The gate was considerably better than the game, for only in the fourth game was anything played like what we are accustomed to consider lacrosse. It was a championship match as far as schedules are concerned, otherwise it had no claim to the title. Why such an organization as the M. A. M. L. I. inspired, Hu(U Adam, Referee, V. to Pollock. The first game was very short and was all Valleyfield, McVicar scoring for them in one minute. In the second game the Huntingdon men, though much lighter than their opponents, played rings around Valleyfield, and scored after 20 minutes' actual play, D. McMillan doing the needful. The teams were forced to retire from the field for about half an hour in this game on account of a heavy thunderstorm. The third game was much the same, and after a six-minute siege, the Valleyfield goal was captured by a shot from McDonald. The fourth game was the longest and most stubbornly contested of the match. For some time Huntingdon seemed to keep up their winning gait, but failed to score, owing to the weakness of the home. Then the game became more even. Hayter was knocked down by a blow of a stick, the referee's whistle sounded, but Valleyfield kept on playing and scored. The goal was not allowed. Shortly after this McPherson hurt his leg, and again Referee Pollock's fog horn gave a melodious toot, but Valleyfield kept right on and scored. Of course this game was not allowed. Valleyfield kicked and talked of walking off the field, but the referee was inexorable and they lined up again. Huntingdon spurted and McMillan again scored after the ball had been in play 1 hour and 18 minutes. The Valleyfield team was fully 20 lbs. per man heavier than their opponents. They had a good defense and a fairly good home. Their stars were Loy, Bishops, Litre and Sullivan on the defense, and Loy and McVicar on the home. The Huntingdon team was anything but well balanced, the home, with the exception of McDonald and McMillan, doing little or no shooting. Hayter in the Hags proved a little wonder and made many clever stops. Cecil at point was a regular stonewall, and he figured largely in the Huntingdon's victory. Boyd, Wright, Elder and McPherson proved fast, reliable fielders and did good work. McDonald was the hero of the home and did splendid work. Contrary to all expectations the match was clear of fouls and Referee Pollock had an easy time of it. The game throughout was very exciting. After the match the Huntingdon brass band played several lively airs, while the Ormstown band, which had accompanied the Valleyfielders, played the """"Grand March in Saul."""" The Orients Win. The Junior Orients and St. Denis Lacrosse clubs met on Saturday afternoon to play for the championship of the Juvenile Lacrosse league. The game was a fast one all through as both teams were in the best of condition. It was a quarter to four when the referee blew his whistle and the teams lined up as follows: Junior Orients, H. Denis, W. Mullin, J. Mailloux, A. Christie; Point C. White, H. Parker; Cover point C. Hemskirk; Defence R. Day; W. Robinson. The race capsized within a short distance of the starting point, and the crews were picked up by the yachts Eclipse and Illawara, none the worse for their mishap. The two last named yachts were started in the 21-foot class, and as this delayed them considerably they dropped out of the race. The officers decided that the 21-foot class would have to be sailed over on another day, so as to give all competitors an equal chance. The Thistledown carried away her mast at the start and dropped out. Several others found the wind and sea too much for them and did not complete the course. The Hippie, of Rochester, was anchored on the bay side of the beach and when the storm blew up she was driven on some piles and sank. The Isle of Wight, of Hamilton, was tied up in the pier, when the schooner Tradewind, of Whitby, passed through the canal, crashed into her and sent her down. In the first laps the Vreda, of Toronto, and Onward, of Rochester, started, but the latter did not finish and the Vreda won. The Condor was the only starter in the 40-footers, but she did not complete the course and got no prize. In the 40-footers the Reelma, of Toronto, won, with the Dicaho, of Hamilton, second, and the Aggie, of Oakville, third. The Cyprus won the 30-foot race with the Alert second. In the 30-foot the Vedette won, Samoscona 2nd, Volunteer 3rd. The Frmo, Lotus, Echo and Nadia also started in the 30-foot class. The Knox of Rochester won blindly, Satoa, 2nd, Maud third. The Wa-wa, of Toronto, was leading in this race when she broke her spar. The 21-foot class had two starters, was declared off and will be sailed on another day. Britannia Beats Valkyrie London, July 8. The Royal Clyde regatta was sailed today. The Britannia won. The Valkyrie was second. WEEK FOR SOCIETY spoke, saying that he could not thank them for all they had done, and Rev. Mr. Boynton said they were the kind of young men who were dear to their hearts, and after thanking Montreal for all its courtesies he assured his hearers that if ever they visited the other side they would get a cordial, hearty reception. Then he called for """"God Save the Queen,"""" and the way it was sung was astonishing. It could be heard all over the city, and was listened to by crowds at every window of the Windsor. After the volunteers were dismissed at the Windsor a large number again formed up and marched to the Balmoral Hotel and St. Lawrence Hall, where they were again thanked by the delegates for what they had done. THE SECOND LEAGUE MATCH Good Scores Made Under Adverse Circumstances THE BATTERY INSPECTED At and do Exceedingly Well The Prairie Camp Dispersed. Montreal's shooting men had an experience on Saturday that they would not like to have again, and the result was that, although no accidents occurred, every one of the one hundred who went out to the Cote St. Luc ranges to fire the second match of the league series were wet through to the skin, and the last range had to be fired while they were in this condition. The storm first struck the ranges while the firing was going on at four hundred yards, and to the surprise of the men who were shooting on targets, thirteen and twenty of their targets went into the air and landed fifty feet away from the butts. This was not the worst; the markers had to rush for shelter, which they did not get, while the marksmen did the best they could with the mats. Captain Finlayson, who was the range officer of the day, in the absence of Lieut.-Colonel Massey, immediately ordered firing to cease, but as soon as the first storm had passed away it was continued at 600 yards. This had not lasted long before another storm, and far worse than the first, came along and in less than the time it takes to tell it the range was practically useless as far as shooting was concerned. The scores, which are appended below, show that some really good shooting was done in the league match, while the Victoria Rifles and Royal Scots, to the number of 20 each, did some Martini practice amongst themselves. At the opening the wind was a left rear strong and puffy; the light was dull and overcast, while the fouling was moist. These conditions continued to change for the worst as the shooting went on and at the conclusion of the day the marksmen could say that they had experienced almost everything in the way of weather. The scores stand as follows: SIXTH H'BII"""" IEKS (FIRST TEAM), 100 400 600 yds, yds, yds.",

It first made its appearance northwest of Galva. About 7:30 o'clock two threatening clouds were seen in the west approaching one another, and the tornado is thought to have resulted from their junction. Its course was south and east through that city, and the main body of the storm passed along the main business street of the city. It came with such suddenness that the citizens had no time to fly to places of safety. In the Free Methodist church there was assembled a congregation. In the rink there was gathering a committee to arrange for a Fourth of July celebration. The church was quickly a mass of ruins and the congregation was imprisoned. A number were injured, one dangerously. The rink also was blown down, but those inside managed to escape without injury. Had the storm come a few minutes later many would have been in the building and a loss of life would surely have resulted. The roar of the storm is described as terrible. It was accompanied by an awful sweep of wind that carried everything before it. Nearly every business house along the principal street was unroofed and stocks of goods badly damaged by the floods of water following the tornado. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy roundhouse was a total wreck. G.A. Cole's barn was torn to pieces. When the wind struck Clans Peterson's residence it performed a curious operation, cutting it in two. The storm in the vicinity of Lafayette is said to have been severe, but the damage was less than farther north. It was in the Free Methodist church in Galva that most of those injured were hurt. This old building is in the southeast part of the town. A large congregation was assembled, but on seeing and hearing the storm started out and nearly all escaped. Albert F. Kirkland, although injured, returned to the church and rescued his brother George, who was buried under a mass of rubbish and would have soon been smothered. The edifice was minced to kindling wood. A large crowd soon assembled and assisted in the work of rescue. Mrs. Gus Johnson, whose husband was badly injured, had a thrilling experience. When the storm was near his house he started to run, while she lay down close to the wall. He was stricken down. The only part of the house left standing was the wall close to which Mrs. Johnson was lying. When found she was unconscious from fright. Not a trace is left of a fine house that stood a mile west of Galva. Cheat Faj, Mont, June 14 The Missouri River is higher today than ever known since the existence of this city. People along the shore are driven from their homes. Bridges are washed out so that there have been no trains over the Montana Central from Helena since Friday. All passengers for the West are held here, including many delegates to the National A.A.D. Dyer & Co, Montreal. Bishop's College Convocation The convocation of Bishop's College, Lennoxville, takes place on Thursday, June 30. The programme is as follows: Holy Communion at 7 a.m.; convocation service at 11 a.m., Rev. Provost Body being the preacher; conferring of degrees at 2:30 p.m. The athletic sports take place on Wednesday, June 28, and the """"old boys'"""" cricket match on June 28. The annual meeting of the Alma Mater Society takes place during the convocation. Haulage by the Storm Sunday's storm caused considerable damage at Saint Jerome. Two barns belonging to Messrs. Lajeunesse and Taillon, farmers, were destroyed and the steeple of St. Sophie church was blown down. The previous night fire destroyed the barn of Mr. Alphonse David, of St. Sophie. In this district especially fences were torn down and buildings badly wrecked by the gale. At St. Luc a slight landslide occurred on Saturday night.

At Liverpool provisions closed at the following: Pork, 63s 9d; lard, 33s d; bacon, 34s 34a 8d; tallow 8s. Produce The market continues unsettled and the easy tone is maintained, but it was hard to get quotations today in the absence of business. The delay to the London steamer, which is not yet reported at Father Point, is a deterrent factor. Most of the operators have orders that could be filled on the boat, but they don't want to go ahead until they are certain of the date of her departure. The first Liverpool boat is pretty well filled also, and as the others do not sail until Saturday buyers are disposed to hold back until they see how Brockville goes. Business on spot, therefore, is rather quiet in the meantime. In the country prices are working lower and it will be seen from our special that colored stock was at a premium at Belleville over white. This fulfills our speculations of a week ago, and on spot, also, the disposition is already apparent to give it the preference. As to spot values our quotation of yesterday can be repeated. Cheese HXa 8'i Ui tier guides S4a 8i Liverpool cable 17s OduUD-s Freight Liverpool, London and Glasgow. S. Irving, of the Toronto News Company, who has made frequent representations to the department on this subject, today had an interview with the Postmaster-General and his deputy and obtained a promise that the rate of postage would be reduced to 1 cent per pound. This, it appears, can be done by regulations under the existing act, but an attempt made by Mr. Irving to get paper-covered books included in the one cent per pound rate was not so successful, as that, it was stated, would require an amendment to the Post Office act. Books, therefore, remain at their present rate. What Will Be Said Mr. Maclean, of East York, gives notice tonight of a very important amendment he proposes moving on the third reading of the bill amending the act incorporating the Midland Railway Company. It is as follows: """"Nothing in any by-law or regulation of the company, whether approved of by the Railway committee of the Privy Council or not, shall be so construed as to allow any rate of fare for way passengers greater than two cents per mile to be charged or taken over the track or tracks of such company."""" Although this applies to the Midland Railway alone, it is understood that Mr. Maclean will suggest to the Minister of Railways and Canals that it might be incorporated in the Railway act and made to apply to all railways in Canada. Improvement In Fertilizers Mr. Thomas MacFarlane, analyst of the Department of Inland Revenue, has just issued a bulletin on fertilizers, by which it appears that the number of various grades in the market is 74 as against 65 last year. Mr. MacFarlane says, """"This probably indicates increased interest among Canadian farmers as regards the use of fertilizers and certainly shows that there is abundant competition among the manufacturers to supply the demand."""" On the whole the result of the analysis appears to be satisfactory and the analyst observes there is a great improvement to be observed in the physical condition of the samples for this year. The coarsely ground bones have disappeared among them, but still some of the fertilizers contain such an amount of moisture as to cause their particles to ball together if kept long in stock. A Novel Excursion A novel kind of excursion struck town this evening and crowded the galleries of the House while the divisions on the second reading of the Redistribution bill were taking place. It was got up by the North Lanark Farmers' Institute and comprised about 1,000 farmers and their wives, families and sweethearts, who have come here for the purpose of seeing the Experimental Farm, which they will visit tomorrow morning. This is a good practical move, which other farmers' institutes would do well to follow. It appears that Mr. Gordon's bill, amending the Chinese Immigration Act, is not to die on the order paper in the annual """"Blinghtor of the Innocents,"""" as Hon. Mr. Chapleau gives notice tonight that he will move that it be removed from the private bills and order to Government orders, which means that it will come up for discussion, but it by no means follows that the Government will not oppose it. In an interview with an intimate friend today Sir John Thompson, in answer to a question whether he intended to reply to the attack of Dr. Douglas in the Methodist conference, said: """"Those who know that a man may change his religious views need no explanation. It would be idle to give reasons to those who do not believe that a man may conscientiously become a Catholic."""" A CYCLONE WRECKED BY St. Johns, Que, Swept by a Terrific Windstorm Ottawa A Windstorm St. Johns, Que, June 14 A cyclone passed over the southwestern part of this town about 1:30 this afternoon, carrying destruction in its way. Mr. A. Bertrand lost two buildings completely demolished and part of a large barn used for pressing and storing hay. Two hay presses were also damaged, large beams torn from the buildings destroyed were carried hundreds of feet in the air and deposited in the surrounding yards and gardens. The peculiar noise alarmed the citizens. Those who got out of doors in time viewed a scene seldom witnessed. A perfect cloud of boards, shingles, etc., hundreds of feet high, were carried through the air, some of them being deposited near the river and others strewn along the course of the storm. The water in the river was blown fully fifty feet high, and all fences in the way of the wind were demolished. A Terrific Storm at Ottawa Ottawa, June 14 The tail end of an uncanny looking electric storm passed over the city shortly after noon today. Rain fell with great force, accompanied by fierce gusts of wind and thunder and lightning. One clap of thunder made everything in the city vibrate and rattle. Quite a number of awnings, signs, loose bricks, fences and trees were wrenched off or broken, or carried away by the wind. Shortly after noon today when the storm burst the loud thunder was almost instantly followed by a summons for the fire brigade. On arriving it was found that the thunderbolt had struck the chimney of the one and a half storey wooden house occupied by Mr. Powers and taking a downward course had carried away the gable end of the house. Fortunately the disaster was not accompanied by fire. The plaster inside was considerably broken and the damage amounts to $6,000. The Damage at Quebec Damage done by last night's storm seems to have been even more extensive than was supposed. The shipping in the Louise Basin suffered considerably. The spars of vessels were damaged and sails torn to shreds and damaged beyond repair. Almost every schooner at the wharves felt the effects of the hurricane. The ship Korwood broke loose from her stern moorings in the basin and had hard work to get back again, assisted by the tugs. The barques Smith and George M. Peak, loading at Commissioners' wharf, drifted out into the stream, taking with them the wharf posts. Both vessels were rescued by the tugs Jones and Victoria. A quantity of timber surrounding the Edith went adrift at the same time. A large portion of it was saved by the tug Three Brothers. On the Louise embankment the wind started several heavily loaded cars and rolled them down the track a long distance before they could be stopped. Along the country roads traces of the storm are visible everywhere. On St. Foy road two large trees on Sleet's farm were blown across the roadway, almost blocking it up. The same thing occurred at the residence of Bissett, on the Charlesbourg road. They had to be removed as they interfered with traffic. In the rear of Bissett's dwelling a barn was wrecked. From other parts of the country come similar reports of destruction, more particularly on the Island of Orleans, where numerous barns and outhouses were brought to the ground. The fences surrounding the old lacrosse grounds and the standing brick walls of the house formerly occupied by Mr. Ross, on St. Louis road, fell a prey to the wind. Fences along the line of Lake St. John are twisted all out of shape. At St. Catherines, county of Portneuf, several dwellings and barns were blown down and trees uprooted. Nearly all the telegraph wires between here and Montreal are down. A CLOUDY DAY PROMISED, With Fine Sales and West to South Winds Today Toronto, June 14, 11 p.m. Pressure is increasing over Ontario and the Eastern provinces, with fine weather in the lakes and Maritime districts and showers in Quebec.

18920223,historical,storm,"BKVKBB RAIN STORM The heaviest storm for many years raged throughout Friday night and Saturday last. Torrents of rain fell causing a rapid melting of the snow. The rivers were swollen to an unprecedented extent, causing great destruction of bridges. The bridge across the upper end of St. John's harbor was swept away. It is expected that the news from the outlying districts will tell of serious damage from flooded rivers. A serious wash-out on the St. John's and Harbor Grace railway occurred between Mannels and Holyrood. Traffic is interrupted and more than a week will be required to make the necessary repairs. The line at this place runs close to the seashore. Perrault's petition to be granted one of the rooms in Bonsecours market for gunstsum was referred to the Market committee. Mr. Perrault states that twenty-six aldermen have sanctioned the action. The Mayor read a letter from the Recorder regarding the sending of several children to the reformatory. In answer to Aid. Stevenson, he said the report on the number was in course of preparation. The report of the Road committee recommending the erasure of Cote des Neiges bill widening from the homologated line of the city was objected to by Aid. Stevenson and laid on the table till next meeting. The report of the Road committee regarding Water Avenue caused much discussion, and as a compromise was referred to the Road and Water committee. The report of the Road and Finance committees in reference to the contract with Coie St. Louis and St. Louis de Mile End, granting these corporations the privilege of draining into the city sewers, was considered. By the provisions of the report they are prevented from draining slaughterhouse refuse, etc., into the sewers, and they assume all responsibility for damage caused either in the city or in their own limits by flooding. After some discussion, in which it was contended that the report was not accurate enough on some points, it was left over till next meeting, and the City Attorney was instructed to prepare the contract. Aid. Stevenson objected to giving the Mayor power to sign a contract of the provisions of which they knew nothing. The report of the Park commissioners regarding allowing the Mount Royal Railway company to cross Fletcher's field also caused a little dispute. Aid. Dufresne and Wilson moved the adoption of the report, and Aid. Cunningham objected after the Mayor had read the motion. Aid. Wilson explained that the city had no power to grant the privilege of crossing the field. After a little conversation between Aid. Cunningham and the Mayor, the latter declared the report held over till next meeting. Aid. Prefontaine gave notice of motion to have the council meetings in the evening, and also to have the minutes printed and distributed to members. MART QUESTIONS ASKED Then the questions began. They were mostly on questions familiar to the public. A gentleman asked for information respecting the duty of the police in regard to the cleaning of the sidewalks, and Aid. Cress was informed that the Health committee was preparing a report regarding the sanitation question. Aid. Nolan stirred up a little storm by asking why St. Ann's ward was not represented on the inundation committee. Aid. Wilson and Germain moved that the names of Aid. Nolan and Stevenson be added, and this caused more trouble. Aid. Nolan having complained of being struck off the committee, Aid. Conroy asked what right Aid. Nolan had to demand to be on the committee. Aid. Nolan replied somewhat warmly to the effect that St. Ann's ward had suffered most from floods, it was most interested in flood prevention, and should not be ignored. Aid. Conroy said he had given way to Aid. Cunningham, who had more property in St. Ann's ward than any of its representatives. Aid. Nolan: By what right does Aid. Conroy give away the rights of the people of St. Ann's ward? I'm astonished to hear him talk thus. He must have felt that he was incapable. Aid. Wilson said he did not object to the gentlemen suggested, but he did to cumbersome committee. Aid. Stevenson said if anyone had a right to complain it was himself. He had been systematically ignored in connection with it. He recapitulated the work he had done in preventing floods and continued that as soon as the work was completed, he would be relieved. They had done his working on his ideas. The question then dropped, Aid. Nolan giving notice of motion to have the formation of the committee reconsidered. The Board of Health for the city was appointed, and the assessment roll for grand and petit jurors was approved of. The council then proceeded to settle the financial question at the Mayor's suggestion. Aid. Rainville: Is this on the orders of the day? Aid. Wilson moved, seconded by Aid. Savignac, that the composition of the Finance committee be reconsidered. Aid. Rainville said he did not object to the understanding, but he did to the procedure. It was for the members who had given promises to redeem them. The motion was discussed, and Aid. Rainville said he reserved his right to object. Aid. Thompson spoke plainly, quoting the promises of Aid. Hurteau and Villeneuve, and said it was for them to redeem their promises. Aid. Villeneuve said that as Aid. Bolsean did not feel like resigning, he offered to resign if Aid. Bolsean would, and let the committee choose. This was not approved of, and he said he would do himself the honor of resigning in favor of Aid. Holland. (Cries of """"Hear, hear!"""") He was being demoted instead of promoted in doing so, but he hoped that good feeling would be preserved and that Aid. Hurteau would still remain in the Finance committee. It looked as if the affair was going to be arranged harmoniously, but Aid. Cunningham raised a lot of hard feeling unnecessarily. He said he was opposed to Aid. Holland as chairman of the Finance committee, and gave as a reason that he was from Hochelaga ward, and so was Aid. Prefontaine; a strong team, he said. Aid. Holland would continue to be a representative of Hochelaga ward, for he did not own a brick or a shingle in St. Antoine ward. (Cries of Order, order!) Aid. Voleau objected to Aid. Villeneuve remaining, and so did Aid. Grenier. Aid. Stevenson moved the acceptance of Aid. Villeneuve's resignation and that Aid. Rolland be accepted instead. A lot of useless talk ensued, and Aid. Grenier and Germain demanded a division, which resulted as follows: Nays: Hurtubise, Nolan, Griffin, Lamarche, Grenier, Bolsean, Germain and Cunningham. Ayes: Cresse, Dagenais, Stearns, Beaudouin, P. Dubuc, Savignac, Brunet, Wilson, Villeneuve, A. Dubuc, Perreault, Claudia-mnp, Gauthier, McBride, Farrell, Dufresne, Tansey, Thompson, Rainville, Coarov, Stevenson, Jeannotte, Prefontaine and Dufresne. Aid. Huiteau then resigned as chair of the Finance committee, and Aid. Stevenson moved, seconded by Aid. Thompson, that it be accepted and that Aid. Rolland be appointed. The latter clause of the motion was eliminated, and the resignation was accepted by a vote of 24 to 8. It was then proposed to elect Aid. Holland, but Aid. Cunningham persisted in his opposition. It was finally declared carried unanimously, and Aid. Rolland briefly returned thanks. City Hall Rates: The Mount Royal Park Commissioners meet this afternoon for the purpose of considering their appropriations for the ensuing season. Last year the appropriation was $17,650, but this year they expect to get $25,000. There were seventy deaths among Roman Catholics in the city last week, 8 of which were due to pneumonia, 8 to bronchitis, 4 to consumption, 8 to whooping cough and 1 each to croup, diphtheritic croup, bronchopneumonia, pleuro-pneumonia, congestion of the lungs and grip. Well-known Hamiltonian Dead: Hamilton, Ont., February 22. A private despatch was received from Buffalo this morning announcing the death of Edward Mitchell, one of Hamilton's most prominent and most popular citizens. Mr. Mitchell was for many years manager at Hamilton for the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and on account of declining health he was obliged to decline the position of general manager which the directors of that concern offered him. He was a prominent member of the Masonic fraternity and held the highest degree attainable here. For some years Mr. Mitchell had been in poor health and he was receiving treatment in Pierce's private hospital in Buffalo when he died. Death was due to heart failure. The body of the deceased will be brought to Hamilton and will be interred here with Masonic honors. Wyoming's Subterranean Fires: Chugwater, Wyo., February 22. One third the area of this state is underlaid with coal. In several districts deposits have been on fire for years. There are cases where the conditions have been volcanic on account of the generation of gases in the seams. One of these disturbances has occurred on the Sweetwater cattle range, 250 miles west of Cheyenne. More than 100 acres of surface was disturbed and the report was heard for thirty miles. Coal and dirt were thrown into the air a great distance. The existence of this fire has been known for twelve years. The Shipping Federation's Scheme: London, February 22. A committee of the Shipping Federation, which aims to break up the seamen's and other allied unions, is on the point of completing a long-projected scheme for the absorption of all the industries connected with shipping. The committee's overtures have met with marked success. They have found that numerous employers of labor in different branches of the shipping industry are anxious to be rid of the present irksome conditions, owing to which they find themselves greatly under the men's thumbs. It is tacitly understood that when the details of the desired cooperation are finally settled the Shipping Federation will throw off the mask and declare a war which shall decide the question of supremacy between the unions and the employers. Palpitation of the heart, nervousness, tremblings, nervous headache, cold hands and feet, pain in the back, and other forms of weakness are relieved by Carter's Iron Pills made specially for the blood, nerves and complexion.

Brooklyn Life: I was troubled for thirty years with pains in my side, which increased and became very bad. I used St. Jacob's Oil and it completely cured. I give it all praise. It's Wm. Kidder, Mr. Chalmers: What do you think of the free reform? Mrs. Whalen: Dire reform, is it? Sure it's a great saving. It's only J. I reformed the old man's pants to fit Dainty, and it's no small job neither. Judge: This town seems to be making great progress, said a visitor to a resident of I. O. H. village, Oklahoma.

TALK OF THINGS THESPIAN: What Is Doing at Local Theatres During the Coming Week: """"I'ReleCelreiln"""" receives a dull failure at New York's Pvaetvr Theatre today. The Boston Howard Athenaeum Star Specialty company opened a week's engagement at the Royal yesterday to overcrowded houses. A long name, a brilliant reputation and decidedly good show are the distinguishing features of the combination. There is another feature which is commendable, as it is rare in variety performance an utter lack of anything approaching vulgarity. It is an entertainment that a lady can enjoy. It opens with an overture, which the audience spoiled by taking all through it. The turn of Josie and Eddis Evans was decidedly funny, and it had an encore, but then encores were a matter of course. Fulyoia, the transfiguretor, is a novelty, his lightning channel of costume in full view of the audience being very ingenious. Falke and Simons are a pair of original musical comedians, who really make D-nalo as well as nonsense. Miss Eva Bertoldi, the ventriloquist, is another act worth seeing. The ease and grace with which she performed her many difficult feats drew forth a storm of applause, which was as much in season as snow in the winter time. The Allisons are a clever pair of dancers, and met with a hearty reception, while Duncan, the ventriloquist, whose act is not quite as original as it might be, pleased equally as well. Melville and Stetson, the vocalists, are old Montreal favorites, and it began to look as if the audience did not intend giving Kan, a juggler, whose feats place him heads above the ordinary juggler, a chance to appear. Golden and Unigg, a pair of comedians, were another good team, and the olio terminated with the wonderful head balancing of the Braati brothers. There is not a weak turn in the whole show, while there are several which are distinct novelties. If much count, there will be hundreds of people turned away at every performance this week. The Lyceum: """"Standing room only"""" was the announcement that met late arrivals at the Lyceum last night, on the occasion of the first appearance in this city of the """"English Gaiety Girls."""" Long before the curtain rose the house was packed from the stage to the gallery, and half an hour later even standing room was at a premium. The performance opened with a taking musical extravaganza, entitled """"Students on a Lark,"""" which gave ample scope for the introduction of a number of pretty women, in equally pretty costumes, as well as some clever specialties and any amount of fun. The lady soloists were Letts Meredith, Led Clark and Nina Bertolini. Miss Meredith's song, """"The Master,"""" was loudly applauded, and a pretty duet by Misses Clark and Meredith received a double encore. The interlude was contributed by Charles Hanley, as the impressionable nigger """"Reuben,"""" and Tom Jarvis as the bayseed 11 Klobs. The inter's KDF, """"These Words Shakespeare Never Wrote,"""" fairly brought down the house, and the whole piece went with a vim and snap that showed both the practice of the artists and the excellence of the stage management. The olio opened with a medley of songs and dances by Nina Bertolini, one of the most graceful dancers now upon the stage. Next came a really funny blackface knockabout act by Hanley and Jarvis that kept the audience laughing from start to finish. Mr. Jarvis is a native of this city, and his clever French gags certainly brought down the gallery, who were not slow to appreciate the fact that he was a Canadian. Leda Clark followed in a series of ballads and selections that were liberally applauded, and then Bunnell and Adams appeared, in their comedy musical act, aided and abetted by their celebrated stuffed dog. Both artists are certainly clever musicians and, in addition to this, Adams is a most amusing comedian; but the stuffed dog fairly divided the honors of the evening. Next came Letta Meredith, who established herself a favorite with the house at once. Her songs are all new and catchy, and as a consequence she was liberally encored. Then came the Amazon march and fancy drill, which is always well received in this city, and the entertainment closed with the three-act burlesque, Mercedes, founded on the play of """"Monte Cristo."""" As usual in burlesques there is only the merest thread of plot, but the many opportunities for elaborate costuming, catchy choruses and unlimited comicalities are fully taken advantage of, and the closing tableau is as pretty a stage picture as has been seen at the Lyceum for some time. Keene Coming to the Academy: Patrons of the theatre will next week have an opportunity of seeing Keene at the Academy. The Evening Times, Chicago, says of him: """"There is all that is awful, morbid and uncanny in Thomas W. Keene's crafty, crown-worshipped Louis XI. The dreadful cruelty, cringing church terror and maddening thirst for life eternal racks the artist's emotional powers as did they the tyrant of France, Louis de Valois. He hangs and beheads and trembles and prays in reality when Keene depicts this puzzling monarch. The characterization is so poignant, so nerve-strung, so scorched with tiger-like rage that the tension tells in the eyes of his auditors. After some of the most magnificent scenes, the nervous strain left a worn look about the more sensitive eyes and a sigh-releasing breath, held in horror, came from a hundred lips. When the threatened German dramatic festival asks us for a representative, America will send Thomas Keene and one scene of his masterly Louis will place him with the greatest. All the mighty ruling fire smoldering in the wicked old king finds vent in Keene's glorious eyes. His face is a study worthy of Rembrandt. Querulous age and sly suspicion lie in furrows over his cheeks and every curve is harsh with stubborn ambition and every angle sharpened by servile superstition. The hollow, fearful eyes, full of token tell-tale of physical suffering, make a stirring picture of the king who was such a great monarch and so small a man."""" Philharmonic Society: Next month the Philharmonic Society will come before their patrons with a grand programme. On March 23rd will be performed, for the first time in Canada, Baint Baens' masterpiece, """"The Deluge."""" On the same evening Gade's """"Erl King's Daughter"""" will be given for the first time by the society. On 24th March Dvorak's """"Spare's Bride"""" will be heard for the second time in Montreal, the society having performed the work once before, about six years ago. This work was a revelation of the vast resources of modern instrumentation, and its repetition will produce a crowded house. The last concert of the Festival will open with the overture to Wagner's """"Rienzi,"""" to be followed by a work new to Montrealers, Mackenzie's """"Story of Bayld,"""" Gossip of the Stage: Richard Mansfield is to play a dramatization of the novel $10,000 a Year. Auku, the Daily intends producing Tennyson's play, """"Maid Marian,"""" next month. Geo. V. U. J. Ut of Henripes Disaster in the Channel: London, February 23. As despatches continue to be received the list of maritime casualties due to the fierce gales which have just swept over the coast of Great Britain increases. Among the wrecks is the Norwegian timber barque Dronning Sophie, which went ashore at Galley Head, a promontory of Ireland in county Cork. Her crew of eleven men were saved. A large steamer bound from Glasgow for South Africa is stranded at Merry Castle, county Wexford. She got off her course during the blinding storm that prevailed last night and went ashore at the height of the storm. A rocket was accordingly shot across the steamer and the breeches buoy was rigged after some difficulty and the captain and his wife and all the crew of the steamer were safely landed not much the worse for their experience. The yacht Sur-jptl has been wrecked at Donaghadee, county Down. The schooner Jane and Alice foundered off Dungarvan, county Wexford. Her crew were rescued. The anxiety that was felt concerning the safety of the British steamer Sir Walter Raleigh has been allayed by her re-arrival at Bear Haven. It is now believed that the steamer which was wrecked yesterday forenoon off Penzance was the Fratello Fabris; some wreckage with that name upon it has been washed ashore. It is thought probable that the entire crew of twenty-six men were drowned. The snowstorm in Ireland continued throughout Saturday night. All trains on the Waterford and Limerick system were blocked. Traffic was only partially resumed yesterday. The Limerick and Sorry line is completely blocked. A mail cart going from Limerick to Tullow was buried in the snow. The driver was dug out of the snow half-frozen. The storm has caused heavy losses in livestock. On Saturday there occurred in Limericktown a rare phenomenon which, though often seen at sea, is seldom visible in landlocked harbors. A storm was prevailing at the time and those who were close to the water felt a black heavy cloud drawing near the city. As it arrived over the harbor it could be seen twirling downward and almost immediately the water beneath was thrown into a state of the most violent commotion and there ascended a spiral column that revolved with great rapidity. Everybody watched the sight with great interest. Finally the suspended column of water and the ascending came together and immediately they did so the whole mass fell with an almost deafening crash. No harm was done to shipping. Later information from Penzance shows that the steamer lost off that port was the Violette, 660 tons, bound from Rotterdam for Liverpool. The body of a man has been thrown ashore by the sea at Penzance. It is supposed he belonged to the lost steamer. The terrible weather prevailed in St. George's channel last night. The French steamer Trigano foundered off the Scilly Islands and three of her crew were drowned. A Flushing mail boat stranded at Queensborough during a heavy fog last night. Her signals of distress were heard at Ubeurne and the British warship Scout went out in search of the vessel, but when she arrived at the place whence the signals were heard the vessel had vanished. A despatch from Gibraltar states that during the storm the Italian barque Nina Schallino went ashore at Cape Spartel and was wrecked. Seven of her crew were drowned. The British steamer St. Panoras, from New York, which arrived at Liverpool yesterday, had on board the crew of the schooner Petrel. It was supposed the Petrel crew had been drowned. DISASTROUS STORMS IN SPAIN: MADRID, February 22. Disastrous storms are reported throughout Spain. The Guadalquivir and other rivers are rising rapidly. Much property has been undermined and destroyed. A train was derailed near Borde de Borde yesterday, one guard being killed and three other persons injured. INUNDATIONS IN WESTERN EUROPE: CONSTANTINOPLE, February 22. Railway communications with western Europe are suspended owing to inundation. No train has arrived or departed since Thursday. THE KAISER WILHELM STRIKES GROUND: LENNOX, February 22. A despatch from Bremen says that the North German Lloyd steamer Kaiser Wilhelm is ashore in the Scheldt. No further particulars are given. The Kaiser Wilhelm is now engaged in the Australian service. She sails between Bremen and Australia, stopping at Antwerp and Genoa and other points. The Scheldt is a narrow river through which steamships pass to reach Antwerp. It is full of shoals, and it is a common occurrence for big ocean liners to get stranded. EMPEROR JOSEPH'S PACIFIC SPEECH: BUDAPEST, February 22. Emperor Francis Joseph, in opening the Hungarian Diet today, said that the relations between Austria-Hungary and the powers continue to be satisfactory and intimated that there was no immediate danger of the peace of Europe being disturbed. Continuing, the Emperor urged the Diet to utilize the present time of peace to make domestic reforms. In conclusion, the Emperor remarked that he trusted the peace would be of long duration. A good impression has been made by the Emperor's speech. THE ENGLISH HOUSE OF COMMONS: LONDON, February 22. Mr. Jackson, chief secretary for Ireland, introduced the Irish Education bill in the House of Commons this evening. The Hon. Henry Chaplin introduced an agricultural holding bill and explained its provisions. It aimed, he said, at a wider distribution of land among the people and to re-create or augment the yeoman class, which had been dwindling for many years. The bill passed its first reading. TENDERS FOR PLANS: LISBON, February 22. Hendoa Cortex, president of the Lusitana bank and a peer of the realm, who was arrested recently, was yesterday examined for three hours by the president of the House of Peers. At the conclusion of the examination he was taken to prison. His arrest was due to his inability to furnish guarantees to the amount of $220,000, lacking in the accounts of the bank. STARVING PEASANTS THREATEN OFFICIALS: MOSCOW, February 22. Peasants in the famine-stricken districts along the Volga, made desperate by hunger, are threatening officials with violence. In one village two officials had a narrow escape from lynching because they refused to relieve peasants who were not needy. In other places the people threaten to plunder landowners. THE FRENCH CRISIS CONTINUES: PARIS, February 22. The Cabinet crisis and the excited feelings growing out of it show no sign of abatement. It is rumored that the Chamber will be dissolved. FOREIGN NEWS IN BRIEF: The Neue Zeit says Prince Bismarck will attend the coming session of the Upper House of the Prussian Diet. The picture representing the sitting of the Alabama Claims commission, a present from America to Queen Victoria, has arrived at Windsor castle. The Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfort and Königsberg Jewish relief committees will meet shortly to consider the refusal of America to receive Russian Jewish emigrants brought by North German Lloyd steamer. KICKED TO DEATH BY A HORSE: GAULT, Ont., February 22. William Huntberger, aged 27 years, employed on a farm of J. E. McBain, was kicked to death by a horse. MAN WHO CLEANS A SIDEWALK HAS HIS OWN STYLE OF DOING IT: Some Plow Down to the Pavement, Others Merely Level the Surface, and Others Cultivate the """"Hog's Back."""" """"There’s one thing about it,"""" remarked an enthusiastic Ottawan in the Hall a few days ago, as he and a companion were discussing the relative merits of the two cities, """"that’s in our favor; we know how to clean our streets, and we’re not content to ride let lumbering, refrigerating street cars, which are about as much on a par with the old stage coaches would be. We’ve got twelve miles of electric railway track, and the cars have never been stopped by the heaviest snowstorm there has been this winter. Everybody rides in them, and everybody finds it a pleasure to do so. They are all upholstered and heated by stoves or electricity. I’ve walked about your streets all day, and am devoutly thankful that all my limbs are yet intact. In Ottawa our streets are cleaned by the corporation, and if not always perfect, there is at least uniformity about them, so that one is not constantly in dread of jerking his head off by unexpectedly taking a step downward of a foot or so. Here is a matter for the City council to consider during the summer. If taken up then it might have a tendency to cool the passions which only too frequently arise during the so-called debates. It would be quite refreshing during August or September to consider the proper means to be employed for the removal of snow from the sidewalks, and the question should be settled then, unless the Mayor should rule it out of season or """"everything all out of order, gentlemen,"""" as he phrases it. This question of removing snow from the sidewalks was on the order sheet last fall, but it went the way of most lucky as by-laws which attain that stage. It was proposed to have certain streets cleaned by the corporation at the expense of the proprietors on the street, with the ostensible object of providing work for the unemployed. Ward politicians killed the project, however. Some aldermen wanted the city to undertake the cleaning of the whole city, but as this could not be done they would allow no part of the work to be undertaken. If John Thomas is given a jam tart for lunch by his mother, why must Thomas John have one also, or he will raise a howl that will be heard all down the street? The present council should take this question up early in the summer, so that the Road department will be able to commence work on the first snowfall next winter. If the city cannot undertake the removal of snow from the sidewalks in the back lanes and the streets in the suburbs there is no reason why the principal business streets, such as Craig, St. James, Notre Dame, St. Paul, St. Lawrence and St. Catherine, should not be kept in proper condition. This work is at present left to the proprietors or tenants, and is done in a most erratic, unsystematic manner. In front of stores the work is generally left to the office boy. This young autocrat considers the work infra dig, and everyone knows the result. He is often just budding into swallow-tails and foppish manners, and why should his tapering white fingers be soiled by contact with the handle of a snow shovel? Gabriel Varden never imposed a pre shameful servitude upon Mr. Simon Tapper, that prince of consequential young apprentices. The work of this type of street cleaner is only equaled in badness by that of the professional snow shoveler. He is generally a decrepit old man, driven to this work by necessity. He has several contracts on hand with merchants and others to clean their sidewalks, and the result of his feebleness and multiplicity of duties is that no section of the work is done well or on time. And then what variations in style one sees, what phantasies in snow! Each affects a peculiar system of his own. One considers the best form not a sidewalk, is what is popularly called a """"hog's back,"""" while another holds the opinion that the snow must be removed clear down to the pavement. The artist in the next section considers that all that is necessary is to flatten out the snow into the semblance of a smooth surface. Assuredly there are many """"ups and downs"""" in our sidewalks, as well as in life. One of the most embarrassing experiences in life those mild days is to come across a man with pick and shovel mining for the hard pavement. You stand on a snow-begrimed, slippery block of ice, with the option of taking a drop of a foot or more or going out into the vehicle-crowded street. Probably you make the plunge and your foot strikes on a round piece of ice, much more treacherous than a piece of lemon pie, and your legs plough up the loosened blocks of ice, while your head comes down with a pleasant pat on the step behind. Others laugh, but you don't. You rise up in a calm frame of mind, and some would-be wag asks you if you are hurt, or if you fell, and you vow in your wrath that you will bring pressure on your eldermanic representatives to have this thing remedied, but you never carry out your intention. Your clothes are soiled, and you are sore on the world, and parts of yourself, for the rest of the day. Or, probably, you are walking along the street in a contemplative frame of mind, and an icicle rattles down on your head and then someone shouts """"Look out there!"""" You look up instead, and see a demon seated nonchalantly in a window (out of your reach, fortunately for him), with a long pole in his hand playfully tapping the long pendants from the eaves and the Gothic windows of the attic. A little further down the street two poles rest against the wall; avalanches of snow are tumbling from the roof of the building, and the magnificent form of a policeman is to be seen on the street corner, the limb of the law chatting pleasantly to the cabman on the stand, while the genial afternoon sun lights up the figures of your friend smiling amiably on the other side of the street. You know, or have heard somewhere, that it is AGAINST THE LAW TO SHOVEL SNOW off a tool after nine o'clock in the morning, but then, who ever heard of the police enforcing the city ordinance? Before the Chief can act it is necessary for some reputable citizen to lay information before him, and besides, this is the duty of the street inspector. Why should the hard-worked policeman notice an infraction of this law? He might offend an alderman's friend and lose his position. If anyone doubts that this work of street cleaning would be better done by the city than when left to property owners or occupants, such an one should take a walk along Craig street and then turn up St. Denis. The Craig street sidewalk is almost impassable. It is full of holes and covered with treacherous hummocks. The same system of shoveling is not followed for one block. No matter how vigorous you are, your faith in your balancing powers becomes shaken. On St. Denis street, crossing Viger square, it is different. This section is done on a system, and the director of that system is Mr. St. George. It is kept level and smooth, and when it becomes slippery it is sanded. It is the only good piece of sidewalk in the city. One gentleman, who lives on Hanguinet street, told the Gazette that he always went around by St. Denis street for the pleasure of walking on a good piece of sidewalk during the winter. With a few scrapers, a few horses and a squad of men every principal street in the city could be similarly well cleaned. A by-law to provide for the cleaning of snow from the principal streets of the city should be at once placed on the first order of the council proceedings. If nothing went amiss, it might be reached, considered and passed before the swallows had returned southward from their su",
18910908,historical,storm,"J, September 7 - The terrible storm prevailed here yesterday. LA TORDRAINE'S STORMY TRIP The Big French Steamship Disabled During a Big Cyclone A BIG MOVEMENT OF GRAIN, Over 7,000 Carloads at Kansas City An Original Suicide-Ballroad Official In Jail New York, September 7 With the captain's gig missing, the stanchions and canvas covering of the bridge torn away, the new French steamship La Touraine steamed slowly up the bay today after an eventful voyage, in which a cyclone played a prominent part. La Touraine holds the best record from Havre to New York. The vessel sailed from Havre on August 29, in command of Captain Frangnel and carrying about 600 saloon and 600 steerage passengers. On the morning of the 30th, a terrific storm set in, foreboding a westerly cyclone. On the 31st, the storm increased, and a huge wave came over the port bow, carrying away the bridge stanchions, rails, and canvas covering. Second Captain Rilba, who was on the bridge at the time, managed to cling to one of the stanchions and was uninjured. Another monster wave dashed over the steamship's bow before she had recovered herself from the first blow, carrying away the crow's nest on the foremast and washing the vessel from stem to stern. By a miracle, no one was injured. The big steamship's stern rose out of the waves as her bow dipped into the valley of green water before her. This caused the twin propellers to race. The sudden strain that was brought upon the engines caused the eccentric rod to twist, causing the vessel to suddenly stop. The vessel lay to for three hours while the damage was being repaired. She was finally got under way again and rode out the storm in safety. Thirteen Train Robbers Killed Uvalde, Tex, September 5 The train robbers who were thought to have escaped across the Rio Grande river with a sum said to be $20,000 which they secured from the express car on the Southern Pacific railroad were met yesterday by a body of rangers who had been in pursuit and a battle took place. From reports received, thirteen of the robbers and two rangers were killed and several on both sides were wounded. The rangers followed what was thought to be the course pursued by the robbers through the mountain pass and although they had at several times lost the trail, they pulled up on the robbers Thursday. They discovered evidence that the men were but a few miles ahead of them and were headed toward Las Vegas. The pursuers pulled up on the bandits strongly and made better time, for after pushing on a portion of the night they were rewarded yesterday by falling in with the outlaws. The engagement was short. The bandits were outnumbered. They held the best position, however, and stood their ground until their dead and wounded were so great that resistance was impossible and then the remainder fled. It is said that two men escaped. Bloody Battle Between Convicts Lexington, Ky, September 7 Violent assaults in the penitentiary made by convicts upon each other yesterday as a third attempted to separate them. The result was that all three are in the hospital with fatal wounds. The three men were sent from Louisville. Their names are Ell Lucas, serving a life sentence for murder; William Bellambe, serving 16 years, and William Johnson, serving 21 years. There had been bad feeling between Lucas and Bellambe and yesterday the latter made a rush at Lucas, who drew a knife and made a sweeping cut across Bellambe's abdomen. Johnson interfered and a brick thrown by one of the others struck him on the head. Bellambe then knocked Lucas down and stamped him about the face and breast. At this juncture, the guards appeared and put a stop to the affair. Bellambe's wound is very deep and he will die. Lucas is in such an unrecognizable and bruised condition that it is difficult to ascertain the extent of his injuries. Johnson's skull was fractured. Banana City Choked With Wheat, Kansas City, September 7 The unprecedented movement of grain from the West is choking the Kansas City market. There are miles of side tracks full of loaded cars and the grain men and railroad men are working night and day to clear the jam. All the elevators at the mouth of the Kansas River are crowded to their utmost capacity. One hundred cars of wheat were turned over to the Chicago road yesterday to be shipped from Kansas, through Kansas City, to Chicago. This practice is growing, and unless the dealers get rid of some of the grain on hand they will lose a great deal of business. The Union Pacific, not being a through road, is hauling the grain into the city like a sausage mill. The Chicago, Santa Fe and California road cannot furnish enough engines to haul the cars here to Chicago. The Santa Fe yards, as a consequence, are stuffed to overflowing. Yesterday there were over 7,000 cars in the Missouri Pacific yards. Will be His Own Step Uncle, Fresno, Cal, September 7 Carroll, of Fresno, today committed suicide at the Prescott House here by exploding a dynamite bomb in his room. The explosion shook all the buildings in the neighborhood. Carroll's remains were scattered all over the room and one arm was found in the street. The windows and plastering were broken and the furniture damaged. He told some persons that he intended to kill himself to create a sensation for the newspapers. He left a note saying life was not worth the living. Minister Egan's Instructions, Washington, September 7 The Department of State telegraphed to Minister Egan on September 4th saying that if a government had been formed by the Congressional party which was acceptable to the people he should recognize it and open communications with its head. Today the department received a telegram from Mr. Egan stating that a provisional government had been established on the 4th instant, with Jorge Montt as president, and was universally accepted by the people and that he (Egan) was in very cordial communication with it. Pacific Railroad Rumors, San Francisco, September 7 The Southern Pacific railroad is about to commence active operations in Oregon and Washington which will create a sensation in the railroad world. Articles of incorporation have been filed by the Oregon & California Railroad Company. The project of the corporation is to build a road from Portland to the state boundary line between Oregon and California and also from Portland south to the southern boundary of Oregon. A Destructive Ohio Storm, Alliance, Ohio, September 7 The most destructive storm ever known here passed over the city yesterday morning. Twelve houses and barns were struck by lightning and burned, causing a loss of $10,000. The electrical display was bewildering in its intensity. It is reported that a number of lives were lost, but nothing definite can be learned owing to the damaged condition of telegraph and telephone wires. Railroad Officials Arrested, Hutchinson, Kan, September 7 LOST IN A HURRICANE Details of the Storm In Which the Steamer Came Aboard Two Men Terrific Storm in the Turk Islands, Halifax, September 7 The following details have been received from Bermuda of the hurricane experienced by the steamer Duart Castle. The hurricane, which was from east to northwest, began about midnight of the 28th ult, and was most severe from that time until about 7 o'clock in the morning of the 29th, when the weather began to abate. At 6:30 on the morning of Saturday the 27th, in lat. 40 8 N, long. 63 18, while heavy cross sea was running, a sea boarded the ship and washed overboard two seamen, Sexton and Noseworthy by name. Captain Harrison was standing near the men at the time and would have also been washed overboard had he not got caught in the ship's rail and grasped one of the stays of the smokestack. As it was, he was badly bruised and had to seek medical assistance on his arrival at Bermuda. The seaman Noseworthy was not seen after he was washed overboard. Sexton was seen, and a life buoy was thrown to him. He secured it and got into it. Then a rope was thrown to him, but the heavy sea that was raging at the time washed him away from the ship and he was last seen waving his hand to those on board. During the storm, the sea boarded the steamer on all sides, carried away about fifty feet of the rail and tore up and twisted the iron stanchions that support the rail. A terrible hurricane and thunderstorm passed over Grand Turk on the 21st ult. Several of the small craft in the harbor were destroyed. A fine sloop which had arrived there a few days previous from Cape Haiti with a man seeking medical attendance was blown out to sea with the sick man, a boy, and one of the crew. When the hurricane abated she was nowhere to be seen and it is feared she must have capsized. Several houses were destroyed. The salt crop for this season will be very short, 30 percent of the salt procured having been spoiled. A FEW LOCAL SHOWERS Predicted for Today, But Generally Fair Little Chance In Temperature, Toronto, September 7, 11 p.m. Tonight the pressure is highest over the upper lakes and Manitoba, and there is a deep depression near the mouth of the Bay of Fundy, causing heavy rain in the Maritime provinces, and another over the extreme Northwest territories, accompanied by very warm weather. The weather has been generally fair except in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Minimum and maximum temperatures: Calgary, 30, 80; Battleford, 43, 84; Prince Albert, 40, 76; Qu'Appelle, 36, 74; Winnipeg, 38, 64; Toronto, 69, 69; Montreal, 68, 68; Quebec, 66, 70; Halifax, 62, 72. Lakes Winds mostly north and west; fair weather; not much change in the temperature. Upper St. Lawrence A few local showers, but generally fair, with strong westerly winds; not much change in temperature. H. Kitts shows a good conception of the part of Gill Riley, and Ed. Brennaca makes a good Mr. Carney. Miss Agnes Carlton well fills the role of Norah Maguire, and as Kate Carney Miss Nell Keen is decidedly good. Miss Maggie Leland well delineates the character of Mr. Kelly, and little Kittle Murphy acts well the part allotted to her, that of little Nell Carney. The other characters are all in capable hands. The Lyceum, The Lyceum Opera house was well filled last evening on the occasion of the reopening. During the four weeks that the house has been closed, very extensive changes have taken place. The walls have been recovered, and a more ceiling, artistically painted, has taken the place of the unsightly rafters. The proscenium has been newly painted, eight new boxes have been built, new scenery has been painted, and the seating room has been increased by about 600 new chairs. Many other changes have also been made, the Lyceum being now transformed into as nice a theatre as one would wish to enter. As before stated, a large audience witnessed the performance of the four-act railway play entitled """"Delmonto."""" The piece abounds in stirring situations, and, judging from the frequent applause, large houses will, no doubt, be the order for the week. Mr. Vio Leonzo played the leading part. The dogs, Spot and Panther, were certainly worth seeing. They were always on hand to help Pomp, their master, out of the several close corners into which the piece took him, and their wonderful bounds for his opponents' threat at the opportune moment took the audience by storm. Rohrnrr Park The very large crowd which filled the vast space occupied by Sohmer Park Garden yesterday was evidently exceedingly pleased with the most enjoyable entertainment which had been provided for them by Messrs.

18961014,historical,storm,"THE BIG STORM A Good Deal of Damage Was Done Along the Jersey Coast Atlantic City, October 1 During the storm Werner's Wonderland building collapsed, and the exhibits and building are a total loss. Richard's bathhouses, Ventnor, have been destroyed, and the steamboat pier on Brighton Beach, 300 feet in length, is gone, sections of it having been carried out to sea. Commodore Harry Turner of the Cricket fleet, in company with Charles Jeffries and William Bavday, left on a halting trip on Friday up the bay and have not been heard from since. Their friends in this city are much alarmed. Beach Isle, N.J., October 13 The high tide yesterday tore away sections of the walk and demolished the fences and verandahs of many cottages on the front. The water undermined the Hotel Brunswick, which is located on the beach, and in a few minutes it collapsed. In falling the building carried with it the house of Mrs. German, of Philadelphia, which is a complete wreck. The railroads are badly washed out. The storm shows no signs of abating. Reports come that several houses have been ruined by the inroads of the sea at Holly Beach. The Phillip J. Walsh Seaside Home for Catholic Orphans is also damaged. All roads are badly washed out. Cape May, N.Y., October 13 In Mount Basba Lake, Orange County, a floating island about one acre in extent, and nearly ten feet deep. It is well covered with large and small trees, and brush and swamp vegetation. Recently the island was anchored at one side of the lake, but in the storm of Sunday night it got loose again, and now floats about, interfering with the fishermen. Ottawa Municipal Statistics Ottawa, October 13 The city assessors' figures show the population of Ottawa to be 61,510, an increase of 1,808 over last year. The valuation has gone up by $953,015, and is now $22,079,735. The increase in real estate is $705,415, and in personal property $102,000. The public school supporters are assessed on $10,407,110, and the separate school supporters on $5,577,910, an interesting fact. We are the only house in Montreal which makes a specialty of fur repairs. All kinds of furs repaired and made as good as new at very moderate prices.

""""James' Garotte"""" The exceptional violence of the recent tornado in Paris, analogous to, but fortunately far less destructive than, the fearful catastrophe at St. Louis in May this year, attracts attention to the extraordinary vicissitudes of the world's weather during the last eighteen months. It will be observed that storms of this locally violent character, entirely different from what are properly termed cyclones, generally occur at the close of a long period of drought such as we have lately experienced. It would almost seem, indeed, as though nature, weary of one type, swung over to the opposite with the petulant violence of a spoiled child. The tornadoes which peppered the Middle States of America this spring terminated a drought which affected a large portion of the territory so severely as to allow the bed of the Ohio river to be worked for coal, reduced the fall at Niagara and lowered the St. Lawrence to an unprecedented extent. Extending the area of observation, we find ever since February 1895, equally abnormal conditions prevalent over India, Australia and the Pacific and the Indian oceans. For example, the southeast trade wind of the Indian ocean, and its twin brother, the southwest monsoon of India, were both very feeble last summer, the failure of the latter causing a drought nearly down to famine mark in some parts of India. Coincidently with and following these conditions on the Australian side of the high pressure atmospheric wall bounding the southeast trades, an extraordinary prevalence of hot, dry northwest winds occurred right on to April 1896, throughout Australia and New Zealand, raising the temperature in New South Wales to such a height that the Government actually carried people free by rail from the Interior to the coast in order to save their lives. The temperature in Sydney ran up to such record heights at 100 and 108 degrees, and even in New Zealand, except at the extreme southern end, the famous hot northwesters of the Canterbury district dried up the crops, while the North Island, especially near Auckland, looked as though it had been toasted in front of some Titanic fire. In contrast, but evidently in correspondence with the abnormal features, the North Pacific was unusually stormy, Honolulu receiving quite an unusual supply of """"Koua,"""" or winter storms, while California, at the boundary of the oceanic area, came in for a similar excess of its curiously marked winter rains. Elsewhere drought seems to have been the rule. The """"low Nile"""" was recently a formidable obstacle to the Soukan expedition, and the violent resumption of rain over its basin in common with the similar change which now seems to be everywhere terminating this world land drought, is creating a fresh scourge by promoting the conditions favorable to the spread of cholera. It is not easy to discover even the proximate cause for such a widespread anomaly, or to draw a practical moral; but a general survey would appear to show that the equatorial rain belt has been less developed than usual, and that the atmosphere over the continents on either side of it has been less heaped up into narrow belts of high pressure and more uniformly spread over large areas. Where this occurs in summer we have the conditions which are favorable to drought, emerging subsequently when the lower air remains stationary, as it did over the United States in the spring, and gradually becomes charged with excessive heat and humidity into those favorable to the production of local storms and tornadoes. The storm at Paris was due to such conditions, and the result of a stagnation rather than an increase in the ordinary movements of the atmosphere. When the circulation over the North Atlantic is more than ordinarily vigorous the energy is expended in the larger horizontal movements, termed cyclones, which frequently embrace an area as large as Russia. It is only when these motions are so reduced as to allow the warm lower air to penetrate the upper layers in places, like water flowing through a sink, and like it to draw in the surrounding air in rapidly rotating whirls, that tornadoes are generated. Such conditions, though common enough over a large land area like the United States, are, fortunately, rendered rare in Europe by virtue of its latitude and geography, so that we need not conclude that the tornado epidemic will ever find a favorable breeding ground over here. On the other hand, it is plain that the occurrence of periods of abnormal weather is common to the whole world, and are of much greater economical importance than the daily changes which at present form the sole subject of prediction by the European Bureau. Not prominently marked, and thus to a large extent masked by the latter, these long waves nevertheless dominate the variation in our seasons, regulate our crops and in many ways affect our general welfare. In India, where the daily changes owing to the comparative absence of frequent minor disturbances are less prominent, predictions are officially made of the average weather of each half-yearly monsoon or season, and with such success that the Government there has recently sanctioned an extension of the mean for constructing such forecasts.

New York, October 13 When a financial community sets itself resolutely at work to make itself despondent where there is no conceivable cause of despondency, it is subject to rude awakening from its nightmare. Wall street philosophers have been out-touting one another for a week with assurance that the political horizon was black, that cheerfulness and confidence were inexcusable, that within three weeks the storm would break. All this time the indications of a wholesome issue to the national election were bright to a degree wholly unprecedented in this generation and were growing daily brighter. The whole performance cannot be otherwise described than as a physiological phenomenon. Senator Quay issues a bulletin which contains nothing more than all Wall street was saying ten days ago; the one free coinage organ in New York talks of the silver party's outlook in precisely the dubious terms employed by all the serious free coinage leaders ten days ago: and the Stock Exchange discovers a complete reversal in the situation. If this is the end of the experiment which began with the mutual declaration: """"Come let us be sane,"""" the return of common sense would of itself be welcome. But after but weeks experience the community is quite capable of falling into depths of gloom again. Nobody can predict the certain course of sentiment during the balance of this month or the course of the market which reflects it. The habit of jumping at shadows may have become chronic enough not to be cured before November 3. Today's market, however, made no uncertain response. It started to advance in London before New York opened for business. Its initial gains here averaged half a point and active stocks were up to two points before the afternoon. As it happened, there was more than one noticeable reason for the recovery. Another lot of $600,000 gold was engaged in London for shipment, making a total engagement of $1,000,000 within three days. Still more significant was the renewed and violent advance in wheat, which this time carried up along with it all other domestic produce. Wheat sold today 3c above last Wednesday's lowest, and 13c above its price at the opening of September. Corn sold 3c per bushel above last week, and is above the September minimum. Oats have advanced 2c within the week and 43c since last month's opening. Even in provisions generally a similar movement is going on, and the perfectly obvious basis for the entire upward movement is the very active demand from Europe. The enormous increase in the export of corn is a safe witness to the real urgency of the situation, with shipments for the week as reported today being half a million bushels above the average of the last four weeks, and double the export average of October 1885. Reflecting all these factors in the situation, stocks advanced sharply at the opening. ANOTHER PLEASANT DAY Fine and Not Much Change In Temperature, the Promise Toronto, Ont., October 13 The great Atlantic storm, which has been travelling up the Gulf stream since Sunday, is now centered a little to the southward of Nova Scotia, and is causing a very heavy east and northeast gale throughout the Maritime Provinces.

south and east reached here today, and ever since morning there has been a strong east gale, with rain in torrents flooding the streets On Lake Ontario Toronto, August 29 The storm today in this region was one of the worst for years The rain was heavy and in the morning the wind was so strong that trees were blown down in many places A good many of the excursion boats abandoned their trips altogether, but the Niagara and Hamilton lines each ran two trips each way The yacht Escape, of Toronto, owned by O Chalis, left here yesterday afternoon for Niagara with her owner and lifeboatman Collings and a boy No word has been received of them and there are fears for their safety A telephone came to the city from the harbor master at Cobourg stating that the steam barge Niagara, owned by J and J Matthews, of this city, is lying three miles off that point with machinery disabled The Storm in the City Montreal felt the effect of that West India cyclone in no mean manner yesterday The rain, which set in at 6 o'clock on Monday evening, continued without intermission until after 9 o'clock last night and by that time an inch and a half had fallen The rain fell steadily all day and made outdoor life more than unpleasant Consequently nobody stirred out unless it was absolutely necessary All outdoor labor was stopped, and it will take the shipping interests and the road contractors considerable time to recover from the damage done One feature of the heavy rainfall was that it gave the Road department considerable trouble Mr St George said yesterday that the department had never had a worse experience in getting the water away through the sewers than during that rainfall The William street sewer, with which there had been no trouble previously, could scarcely carry off the flow Some of the other sewers were also choked up The Wellington street subway was flooded by about eight feet of water, which rendered it practically useless, and pedestrians had to resort to the old level crossing while streetcar passengers had to be transferred Moreover, the storm played havoc with the telegraph wires, rendering communication with outside points most difficult, if not impossible The telephone and fire alarm wires were also badly damaged On the River The storm was rather severe on the upper river, and delayed the passengers of the R H while the business department will be managed by Fred Mailette, of this city Leaders of the Canadian independence movement have subscribed $1,000 toward starting the paper Its name will be Independence and will

And Interrupted Yesterday's Shooting at Ottawa THE COMPETITORS' MEETING They Find Good Deal to Grumble About the Social Events of the Meeting By our own reporter Ottawa, August 29 For the first time in the twenty-five years' experience of the members and competitors of the Dominion Rifle Association a day's shooting has been postponed on account of the weather, not because of the storm, which started in on Monday afternoon and then put a stop to the shooting and which continued up to two o'clock this afternoon, but because it was found although the riflemen were willing to shoot that the targets would not work The slides had become so swollen that the targets could not be pushed up and down, while the targets themselves had become so soaked during the night's rain that a patch would not remain on The result of this was that the shooting men who gathered at 8:30 in the morning, in the midst of a driving rain storm and an easterly gale, waited until noon without firing a shot, and then the executive committee met, with the president, Major J THE FENCING MASTER The Mapleson Company Next Week Current Attractions This morning, at 10 o'clock, the advance sale of seats begins at Nordheimer's for next week's engagement of the Mapleson and Whitney Opera Company at the Academy of Music The Fencing Master receives its first Canadian promotion during this engagement, and a party of the New York jeunesse dorée are coming to Montreal on the opening night to witness the sensation of seeing Laura Schirmer Mapleson for the first time in this character They consider it the correct thing to do The original fencing girl students have been retained by Managers Mapleson and Whitney, and Monsieur Senac, the Paris champion of the art of fencing, has been teaching Laura Schirmer Mapleson, and in a recent interview in the New York Herald, declared the accomplished prima donna to be one of his best lady pupils, and expressed the opinion that she would astonish the public with her skill in the great duel scene in the Fencing Master Jarbenn Makes a Hit Last evening's weather was not in any way calculated to draw people to the theatre, but Madame Jarheau and her company made such a hit on Monday evening that their second performance was greeted by a well-filled house, much larger, in fact, than could have been expected Starlight is a success, and should be seen by everybody who desires to exercise their risible faculties Lawrence Hanley A Special dispatch from Boston announces that Lawrence Hanley, the talented young American actor, who appears at the Queen's next week, has scored a great hit in Blanche Marsdea's new drama, The Player The American cities speak in the highest terms of Mr Hanley's ability and the admirers of true dramatic art in this city may look forward to a real treat next week Theatre Royal Rain or shine the Theatre Royal is always well patronized This was never better proved than yesterday when, despite the unprecedented rainstorm, large audiences filled the house at both performances She has evidently caught on to the popular taste, for its rendition is received with great enthusiasm It will be repeated every afternoon and evening until Saturday night Next week the attraction will be the London Specialty Company, direct from the London Theatre, New York, and big things in the variety line are promised THE CODE To the Editor of the Gazette Sir, In your issue of Monday you report the trial of a keeper of a disorderly house, her condemnation, and punishment, the latter being a fine of $100 and costs Apart from the loathsomeness of thus enriching the civic treasury with the avails of prostitution, and of giving the woman a quasi-license to continue her occupation, this judgment is in apparent conflict with the new criminal code Article 318 makes these persons liable to one year's imprisonment, without the option of a fine; and under article 207, if the subsection be relied on, the punishment may be six months' imprisonment with a fine not exceeding $50 Some questions in the public interest are why was not this criminal indicted under article 198; under what article in the Code was she fined $100; and why was she not imprisoned in any event, rather than merely fined and let loose on society? One other question why did not the authorities put the owner of the Cadieux street premises in the dock beside the woman? CENSOR MONTREAL'S BIG FAIR Everything Proceeding Naturally for Next Week's Exhibition The Exhibition directors are working hard to have everything in readiness for the official opening of the exhibition on Monday next They are nothing daunted by the rain of the past two days, but are hopeful that fortune will smile on them next week They have accordingly issued a notice to intending exhibitors urgently requesting them to have their exhibits placed in position on Saturday next as Monday is a civic holiday and Labor Day, as well as the official opening Manager B 6 TVTTT? rt A rI7rpmTi 1 1 I IV rl' I) 1?

rain and accompanying gale, if annoying to the ordinary citizen, was doubly so to the broker and speculator interested in news from the outside world All day the ticker was silent as regards what was going on on the outside exchanges, and beyond some sort of information, secured by means of the long distance telephone, no news was received, as a result business generally was quiet, with little to note There is considerable talk on the street with regard to recent activity in Reading Block, it being noteworthy that throughout the panic there was generally a market for it The Commercial Advertiser sums the matter up as follows: The activity in circles identified with Reading stock and bondholders and the remarkable strength of Reading securities are beginning to attract attention For some time past, in fact throughout the whole of the July panic, there was always a market for Reading stock At present the securities of the road are selling 'mystery on,' and very conflicting accounts as to the nature of this mystery are current To the casual observer Sir Isaac L Rice is the only man that looms up in connection with Reading at present, of whom it can be said that he has a clear cut and well-defined policy There are many who believe that he will control the destinies of Reading next spring By contrast with his position that of the present management of Reading is hopelessly illogical and contrary to common sense There is unfortunately good ground for accusing the two committees representing general and income bondholders of being too easygoing in their dealings with the management Just at present these things are not very important, except in a general way, as showing that life is beginning to re-enter some of the corpses resulting from the recent panic, so far not much importance is attached to the stories of Mr McLeod's reappearance as an active railroad man in constructive partnership with Mr Russell Haire Hill, even the talk with regard thereto is valuable as an index of the extent to which the tendency to recovery is at work The monetary position across the lines must be easing up and the feeling is apparent that the worst has been seen and that the remainder of the year will witness a progress, if a slow one, toward better things The heavy arrivals of gold from Europe and the Pacific coast have had their effect in New York in checking the bearish sentiment to a certain extent, but for all that all eyes are turned to Washington and speculators are still playing a waiting game pending advices regarding the repeal measure Speaking of the course the New York banks have followed and still follow in some cases, the Commercial Advertiser says: It is greatly to be regretted that the Clearing House banks of this city still pursue the policy, at all events the nominal policy, of reserving for themselves the right to refuse cash to a customer in payment for a cheque There is absolutely no excuse at this present time for such a policy, and there is every reason for a public and formal reversal thereof The handle given to Chicago and other bankers by the continuance of the New York banks in a state of placid suspension may be put to very undesirable uses in consequence of the ignorance, perhaps something worse, of these country bankers It is all very well for New York bankers to laugh at or even honestly despise the remarks of Chicago bankers in the circular just sent out by them to their country correspondents, pointing out the impossibility of making satisfactory quotations for New York exchange but it is to be remembered that the people into whose hands this circular will fall are not likely to share these feelings of amusement and contempt, but are rather likely to take them au grand sérieux with the result of additional inconvenience to everybody at a time when there is really no reason therefor A formal announcement by the Clearing House association that the banks are ready to pay cash on all cheques is the one thing required to release money from hoards throughout the country It will render the movement of the crops, which, under the present circumstances, will be a most troublesome proceeding, easy everywhere There is absolutely no reason to doubt this now that the currency premium has fallen away to a vanishing point The policy is one that commends itself to those who are able to see further than their noses, and only the selfish and timid, of which there are three or four first-class examples among the New York bank presidents, are opposed to it It seems a great pity that these men have the power to hamper and inconvenience the public by hindering necessary action, as they have done more than once in the present crisis The local money market is precisely the same All bankers and lenders maintain the conservative course they decided to steer some time ago, and the fact has its effect in restricting speculation The local Stock Exchange shows no alteration Business was nominal today, and the fact above mentioned that there was no outside news at all was not calculated to enliven matters Only a few stocks were dealt in and the transactions in each case were small, no important change in tone being noted Pacific was somewhat firmer in the purchase of 100 shares at 71 and Cable also advanced to 124 123 Duluth common was firm and so was Bell Telephone, Colored Cotton and Street Railway, while Commerce and Molson for the banks were steady In fact the tone of what trading there was exhibited a rather better feeling MORSING BOARD 20 shares Commerce at

from either London, New York or Chicago today Messrs IT WAS A GREAT FIRE The fire, which lasted about three hours, was one of the fiercest that has been seen in the city for years Smoke was seen issuing from the third floor at 6:15, and an alarm was at once rung in from box 321, at the corner of James and Place d'Armes, and as the fire looked threatening second and third alarms quickly followed, calling in the whole brigade By this time the flames were bursting out of the third and fourth storey windows of No 89, and shooting almost across the street The fiery flames, clouds of belching smoke and wind-driven sheets of rain made a fearsome sight, indeed Construction and destruction were side by side, for adjacent to the burning building was the new Banque Feu being constructed The firemen erected the Bangor extension in front of the blazing structure and sent up a stream by this means, but it had little effect on the fierce flames It was some time before other streams were on the front, owing to the delay in getting the Hayes ladder into position All the three streams which were directed from the street scarcely reached the flames on account of the strong north easterly wind Mr d, an inventor, with his wife and two children They likewise had a narrow escape Mr Ford went to try and assist Mrs Mason, but as the fire got so furious he went to the assistance of his wife and children, but he found that they had gone to look for a place of escape, which they did by the roof and there called for help, which was soon given by Messrs Grenier, G Gratton and A Claude, of Pratt, who rescued them by the freight elevator, which Mr Perrault used, and which rendered good service in enabling the firemen to reach the upper storeys Mr Perrault also got all hose in his building ready for action should it be required THE HEAT FROM THE FIRE was very intense, but despite this the men on the ladders stuck to their posts Burning boards and pieces of the roof were falling constantly, and fears were entertained that the walls would collapse About a quarter past nine o'clock the roof fell in with a terrific crash and a pyrotechnic display of sparks The wind carried these as far as Notre Dame street, but owing to the wet condition of the roofs, fortunately no evil results ensued, although watch was kept on all the time A portion of the wall also carried inwards with the roof, telephone wire fell across the trolley and successive flashes of blue flames frightened the immense crowd that stood in the rain watching the spectacle A fireman's narrow escape A fireman was caught in a falling piece of roof and fell from the ladder He was taken in the ambulance to the Notre Dame hospital, but as he was not much hurt he left immediately afterward The tea belched out and glass cracked when the flames were at their height No 87, another alarm was sounded from box 24, and a section of the department had to be dispatched to it It was a pretty sight to see the flames bursting in the western sky and illuminating the darkness Despite the most serious efforts of the firemen the fire spread and lapped up the water as quickly as it was poured upon them There was a fire wall between 81 and 83 and this was looked upon as a good omen as it was felt that it would check the onward march of the flames The fire at one time seemed to laugh at the firemen as it jumped quickly from top coat to the one below and set it ablaze The General and Notre Dame engines responded to the alarms and remained on the scene for a long time THE LOSS IS HEAVY The damage will probably be about $100,000 Mr George Bury, who is agent for the property, which is owned by Judge J 6, said, when seen last evening, that the insurance on each building was what companies usually placed, as the papers were locked up in his safe in his office which, by the way, is badly damaged by water Mr Mareotte occupied seven storeys, two of them facing on Fortification Lane, and all were stored with goods He says he had about $65,000 worth there and an insurance of $20,000, which was placed by his bookkeeper, Mr Gauthier, but as the latter was in Montreal, the amounts and companies could not be ascertained Messrs Mathieu Freres had a heavy stock of liquors, and their loss will be considerable Streams were kept playing on the ruins for several hours During the progress of the big fire a carpenter's shop belonging to Mr Lessard, at 106 St Dominique street, was totally destroyed The fire in the Enterprise Tobacco Company's works, at the corner of Fullum and Notre Dame, also broke out again last evening",
18860106,historical,rain,"M'Williiy Hut Unit in the cold spell in the first of the year, Christmas day was mild and blustery. The day after a blizzard, known to many, it rained for twenty-four hours, the rains, and the morass. Travel by rail and stage was followed by a heavy rain and storm, accompanied by a gale of wind, which played havoc with the telegraph wires, and was very disastrous to shipping on the coast. Half a dozen or more tables are landed in Cape Breton. Two-thirds of the cable business of the continent passes through Nova Scotia and is handled at these offices. A storm that demoralizes the land lines, therefore, also paralyzes the cable business. That was the experience for about forty-eight hours last week. The greatest trouble was found with that section of the line along the narrow neck connecting Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and separating the Bay of Fundy from the Straits of Northumberland. It is exposed on both sides, and when it succumbs to storms of rain and wind, followed by heavy coatings of ice, the work of repairing is almost equal to building the line anew. During the interruption in communication over the land systems, the cable business was performed as best it could be over the short cables via St. Pierre-Miquelon and Duxbury, Mass. Another mild spell followed, and New Year's Eve was as mild as Christmas Eve had been. But a heavy rainstorm set in about noon yesterday, and, within an hour or two, pedestrians had to make their way along the streets through a foot or more of slush, while those unfortunate enough to be in sleighs had their teeth set on edge by attempts to slide over bare earth and stones. There was no levee held at Government House, Governor Richey having sustained a fall some time ago and was unable to endure the fatigue of standing for a couple of hours. But many prominent citizens wended their way through the storm to pay their respects to Archbishop O'Brien and United States Consul-General Phalea. Archbishop O'Brien leaves this afternoon for Rome, where he goes to present himself to the Holy Father for the first time since his appointment to the Archiepiscopal See. Dr. O'Brien received the greater part of his education at Rome; and he goes back today with the proud distinction of being the youngest archbishop in the worldwide Roman Catholic Church, and with a rapidly growing reputation as a scholar, controversialist, writer, and administrator. His Grace will be accompanied by the Rev. Father Ellis. P.J. Gregory, commodore of the Quebec Will Club, will leave today for New York on business connected with the club; he will be absent several days. The members of the L'Isle-aux-Coudres have passed resolutions of respect to the memory of the late Robert Chamber, ex-mayor of this city, and will attend the funeral of the deceased gentleman in a body today. The city council will also attend in a body. A beginning was made last week in the way of opening the Louise docks to public business by the landing thereon of a trainload of square timber, consigned to Messrs. I.R. Dobell & Co. The timber was square birch, manufactured at Lake Kept Island, near St. Raymond, and came into line by the Lake St. John railway. As a lagniappe portion of the timber landed on these docks will be able to go direct into the vessels without light draft, it is probable that a great deal of sawn lumber as well as timber will be handled there this year. The thaw still continues, and under the rain of the last day or two the snow is fast disappearing. LATENT RECOGNITION OTTAWA. Suriname (Mil) Resolutions regarding an International. Ottawa, January 5. The regulations admitting American oil for the Northwest branches free of duty, which expired on the 1st of January, have been further ordered in form until the 1st of September by an order-in-council. Hon. Mr. Cochrane transacted business with the Department of the Interior today. Hon. Mr. Adam, ex-treasurer general of New Brunswick, had an interview with several ministers of the Crown today. An interesting wedding took place this morning at St. Andrew's Church, when Mr. James C. Innes, of Campbelltown, son of Senator Campbell, led to the altar Miss Mary Louise Grant, eldest daughter of Dr. Grant, of this city. The bride was attired in an elegant costume of white satin trimmed with Durham point lace and orange blossoms. She had a beautiful bouquet, the gift of the bridegroom, composed of roses and lilies of the valley. The bridesmaids were Miss Cochrane, Miss Mary Gilmore, Miss Harriet Grant, Miss Gwendoline Grant, and Miss Amy Ritchie. The groomsmen were Mr. Ernest Cochrane and Dr. Grant, Jr. After the conclusion of the ceremony, an elegant breakfast was provided, to which over two hundred invitations had been issued, over a hundred and fifty being accepted. Among the guests present were Major-General Sir Frederick Middleton, Chief Justice Sir William and Lady Ritchie, Mrs. John and Miss J. Gilmore, Senator, Mrs. and Miss Cochrane, Mr. A BRIDGE COMES DOWN WITH A CRASH. Ottawa, January 5. About 10:30 this morning the immense pressure of broken ice coming down the Rideau River proved too great for the dam owned by Messrs. Dunn & Macdonald for the purpose of aiding in the construction of the new bridge across the river at New Edinburgh, and with a tremendous crash the woodwork gave way and was swept over the falls. The rapidly rising water will cover the stone piers in the course of erection, and in a few minutes the ice road across the river broke up and followed the woodwork of the dam, thus cutting off all vehicular traffic with the village of New Edinburgh, except by way of St. Patrick's Bridge. All the work on Messrs. Dunn & Macdonald's contract is temporarily suspended, and as the quantity of ice coming down is still increasing, it will probably be a day or two before operations can be resumed. Owing to the mild weather and heavy rain of the past week, the water in the Ottawa River has risen very considerably. The appearance of things around the Chaudière mills and falls looks more like a general spring break-up than a thaw in winter. At Montebello today a serious washout occurred on the C.P.R. FLOODS IN PENNSYLVANIA. Williamsport, Pa., January 5. The river here has reached twenty-four feet, the highest since the big flood of 1863, when it was twenty-seven and a half feet. It is still rising slowly, but it is believed that it has commenced falling at the head of the stream. The wires are all down west of Pennsauken. Several million feet of new logs went down this morning. The water is now surrounding the Philadelphia and Reading station. No trains have gone out on the Pine Creek or Beech Creek roads today. A train from the East on the Philadelphia and Reading is detained below Loyal Rock Creek, where the bridges are impassable. A train was sent down from here to transfer passengers and it has not been able to return, as trains have been placed on the tracks loaded with railroad iron to prevent the trestle work from going. Almost the entire territory between the canal and the river in this city is submerged and considerable damage has been done. Trains are now running on the Philadelphia and Erie road. Shenandoah, Pa., January 5. The rainstorm throughout this section yesterday and last night was the most severe for a number of years. No less than twelve collieries in the Mahoning Valley are flooded and thrown idle by the rains, and trains on both railroads have been delayed from two to eighteen hours. There are three washouts between Delano and Ashland on the Lehigh Valley Railroad. Some of the flooded collieries are expected to resume operations in a few days, but weeks will be required to remove the water from others. Allentown, Pa., January 5. The water in the Lehigh River was swelled eight feet by the rain of yesterday. Today the city is practically without drinking water and the pumps at the waterworks were flooded and rendered useless. At Bethlehem the water backed into the boiler house of the Bethlehem Iron Works, putting out the fires, and that company was obliged to shut down. The mill will be idle for some time. Hazleton, January 5. Last night's rainstorm did a vast amount of damage throughout this section of the anthracite coal region. Five of the collieries are completely drowned out. Twenty-three mules were drowned. Easton, Pa., January 5. This afternoon the Lehigh River here is sixteen feet high and the Delaware River eighteen feet. The first floors of several mills are covered with water and work has been suspended. Trains on the Lehigh Valley and Lehigh and Susquehanna Railway are delayed by landslides and washouts. The coal and freight trains on the latter road have been abandoned. York, January 5. The Susquehanna here has risen ten feet in as many hours, causing a great deal of damage. This morning the rain changed to snow, but the water continues to rise in this city. Cellars are flooded and many merchants are moving goods from the basements. At Oswego the Erie Railway bridge has been carried away, and trains are being run over the track of the D. F. McCarthy of Philadelphia, and Jack Dempsey, to fight at 110 pounds according to Marquis of Queensbury rules for $2,100 a side. The fight will come off within six weeks, but the place has not been settled upon. The weather this season has been anything but propitious for tobogganing, for no sooner do the slides get in fairly good condition than along comes a thaw and spoils them before they can be used. Fixing a date for a formal opening is a puzzling thing for a committee to do this year. Says the New York Clipper: Possibly the New York State League made a mistake when they declined to take in the strongest of the Canadian baseball clubs and thereby form a strong eight-club international league. Ten times more interest would be taken in the fight between the Canadian and New York State clubs than can possibly arise from local contests alone. A contemporary laments that poker as a game of cards is no longer confined to professional gamblers. Our neighbor does not know what it is talking about. There has never been a time when professional gamblers monopolized poker or any other game of cards. Any game confined to that class would speedily die out. Professional gamblers are non-producers. They cannot live upon one another. On Saturday Mr. Joseph Burroughs and his assistant, in company with the president and secretary of the Winter Trotting Club, chained off a full mile track at Leamy's Lake. The rain of last night put the ice on the lake in good shape for a clear ice track. The fence will be put up during this week, and just as soon as there is a cold snap a program will be issued for an inaugural that will bring out the locals. Ottawa Citizen. There is a pugilist, says an American exchange, somewhat known to fame as """"Jack Dempsey."""" He is quoted in an esteemed contemporary as saying: """"I am willing to fight any man in the world, barring John L. Sullivan. He is my friend."""" No better ground on which to base such an exception has been taken since the black-and-tan terrier refused to fight the Siberian bloodhound lest his huge adversary should take a defeat too much to heart and die of humiliation.",
18950819,historical,rain,"AUGUST 19, BULLETS FIND BULLETS The Sixth Fusiliers' Thirty-First Rifle Matches, THE VICS AGAIN WIN The Team Prize The Montreal Rifle Association Last Monthly Match Drysdale Wins, On Saturday afternoon at the Cote St. Luc ranges the 6th Fusiliers held their first annual matches, and a success they were in every sense of the word. The weather was excellent for shooting, being not too bright, and but for rather an unfavorable wind, which by now seems to be quite the usual thing on a Saturday afternoon, the conditions were most favorable. The rain held off well, too, the first shower just commencing when the men got through at the 600 yards. The scores, as will be seen below, were excellent, in some cases exceptionally good, and the contests were throughout close and exciting. In the open match for teams the Vics again came out ahead with 421 points to their credit, six points ahead of the third team of the M. SATURDAY'S DELUGE The Heaviest Rainstorm Seen in Montreal for Years, BURSTING OF A SEWER Floods Many Houses in Ste. Hypollite Lane Much Damage Done Throughout Ontario, The heaviest thunderstorm of the season broke over the city on Saturday night. People had begun to remark upon the great freedom we were enjoying from heavy storms this summer, but the one on Saturday night made up for all deficiencies. It broke about 9 o'clock, and for a couple of hours the heavens were let loose. It thundered, it lightened, it rained, it hailed, it blew. At the height of the storm it thundered almost incessantly, and flash followed flash of lightning with such vividness and quickness that the mountain was in an almost perpetual glow, and the objects upon it were as clearly visible as at noonday. Some of the peals of thunder were terrific, and one particularly, which seemed to be directly over the corner of Mercury and St. Catherine streets, was so loud as to cause the occupant of a store in that neighborhood to rush out of the building, through the blinding rain, across the street, under the impression that the structure was going to collapse. The building, however, withstood the shock, and in due time the scared persons again took shelter under the cover of their own roofs. Probably the most remarkable portion of the storm was the heavy downpour of rain, as well as hail. It did not come down even in big drops; it came down in sheets so dense that it was scarcely possible to see from the road. It gave the streets one of the most thorough scavengings they had for many a long day. They simply became watercourses for the time being, and any refuse that was upon them was swept along like chaff before a whirlwind. Pedestrianism was entirely out of the question, and all who had failed to reach home before the storm broke for once blessed the man who adapted electricity to locomotion. There is an adage to the effect that """"It is all ill wind that blows nobody good,"""" and the carter came in for his share of what benefits there were in the shape of fares. Altogether the storm was the heaviest that has struck the city for some years. The wind blew 40 miles an hour when the storm struck the city, and during the twenty-four hours traveled 175 miles. The rainfall on Saturday, from about 8 to 10 o'clock (midnight), was 1.68 inches, and during yesterday 1.21 inches of rain fell in the city. It is conjectured that the storm entered Canada at Detroit and swept westward across Ontario, doing much damage, considerable damage, but fortunately there was very little loss of life. The heavy rain on the river, but resulted in Saturday evening in the flooding of the cellars and lower parts of the houses on St. Hypollite Lane, at or near Tularin street. Shortly after 6 o'clock the heavy downfall of rain compelled a large number of the inhabitants to remain indoors, but to their surprise they found water creeping through the flooring and within a very few moments not only were their cellars flooded, but their furniture was seen floating about in the sitting rooms, and before the inmates realized their danger they were standing in from two to three feet of water. Great excitement was occasioned when an invalid named Pierre was taken out from No. 12 Hypollite Lane. At first, it was rumored that the gentleman had been overtaken by the rising water and before he could be rescued he was drowned. This rumor fortunately was without foundation. There are eleven houses in the upper part of St. Hypollite Lane, and not one escaped damage from the flood. Several of the householders stated to the M.P. last evening that they intended leaving the city. Flooding of cellars was reported in many parts of the city. The Montreal Street Railway Company were also the victims of Saturday night's storm. The rain fell so heavily on St. Lawrence streets, while, before the rain had stopped, it had piled up about two feet. The service was delayed for over an hour, but a huge gang of men were soon sent to the scene and in a short time the line was clear. Solmer Park was not the pleasant place to be in during the storm, but the people there were better off than many others. Sure the rain sprayed through the skylights and the wind swept it in from the west side, but it was not until the wind veered round to the south and blew clouds of spray through the immense auditorium that the people began to get uncomfortable. It seemed strange to see people listening to a concert, for the programme went on, with umbrellas over their heads, and startling peals of thunder lent an effect to the musical times that was noteworthy. St. Helens Island and the rain swept river would be remarked upon at times with remarkable distinctness. A momentary view of Victoria Bridge by the flash of the lightning produced a thrilling effect that Mr. Sparrow, no doubt, would give a good deal to be able to counteract on the stage. Occasions like this furnish views of the city which few dream of. For a time last evening the rain was almost as heavy as on the evening preceding. There were a large number of people who had reason to abuse this sudden storm and say hard things about the weather generally. These were the passengers on an electric car, in the close vicinity of Alwater Avenue, that went off the track last evening, due, it is said, to the heavy rain washing the grit onto the track. Matters had just started to get interesting when another and yet another car came up behind and in a short time there was quite a procession. Considering the weather, the passengers evidently thought it the best policy to stay in the car and in a great many cases, sad to say, used violent language. There was nothing to be done, however, but wait, and wait they did until about half an hour afterwards the car was placed again on the track and all was well again. One result of the extremely heavy wind which preceded the storm was the breaking of a new and very heavy looking telegraph pole on Notre Dame Street, near McCord. The heavy timber was snapped as a twig, and had it not been for the quantities of telegraph wire which formed quite a netting, the pole would in all probability have crashed through a photographic studio, a not very substantial building, in the vicinity. The Storm up West, Detroit, Mich., August 17. During a thunderstorm about noon today, lightning struck the United Presbyterian Church, in process of erection at the corner of Grand River and Alexander Avenues. It killed one of the workmen and injured half a dozen others more or less seriously. Simcoe, Ont., August 17. During a severe thunderstorm this afternoon, John Johnson, son of Humphrey Johnson, a farmer in the Ninth concession of Malahide, was killed by lightning. Uxbridge, Ont., August 17. During a heavy electric and rain storm which passed over this vicinity today, considerable damage was done. The barns of Thomas Dales, a farmer living about three miles west of here, were struck by lightning, and were completely destroyed together with the whole season's crops. No insurance, it having expired but a week ago. A heavy gale of wind accompanied it and did great havoc with trees, but more especially at Krieau, a summer resort situated south of here on Lake Erie, where all the tents occupied by campers were blown down and several yachts and sailing boats were driven from their moorings. Picton, Ont., August 17. At five o'clock this evening a very heavy storm broke over this town. The rain fell in torrents, accompanied by sharp lightning, some hail and a terrific wind, which tore up pieces of sidewalk, uprooted and broke shade and fruit trees, and partly unroofed some barns in the vicinity. As yet no serious accidents have been reported. The apple crop is much damaged. Listowel, Ont., August 17. During the heavy thunder and lightning storm which passed over this place about 8 o'clock this afternoon, the barns on the farm of D. CABLE GOSSIP, Earl of Derby has a Small Riot on Hand-Hard on Keir Hardie, New York, August 18. The New London cable says: The late Canadian viceroy, Earl Derby, has engaged in combat with the inhabitants of one of his Flintshire manors, which tonight it is reported has developed into a small civil war. They have enjoyed a shortcut footpath over the hill on his castle domain for three generations; he has now enclosed it with a high fence and ordered that admission to the hill and castle ruins shall be only by ticket. Mobs of indignant villagers tore down the fence as fast as it was built and burnt the notice boards, and a Welsh member, who passed through the district today, tells me the expectation is that a force of Chester police will be brought out to coerce the crowd, which is quite resolved to resist. Keir Hardie, who sails today for a lecture tour in America, deserves no attention from labor leaders or anybody else, and will probably get what he deserves. John Burns really has something in him, but Hardie is a mere empty fraud, who won notoriety in the Commons only by wearing dirty old clothes and a coster's cap instead of a hat of parliamentary tradition. This would have been forgiven as a part of the general scheme of securing an audience if there had been anything genuine behind his affectations, and people tolerantly waited to see if there was, but in vain, just a blatherskite, pure and simple. Gladstone now issues a post-card judgment on some book or ethical problem submitted to him nearly every day, and, sad to say, the papers have taken to printing them in very small type in obscure corners. One today contains the statement that he is personally grateful to science for all that it has done and is doing, but Christianity stands in no need of it, and is as able now as ever to hold its own ground. A curious report is afloat that Swinburne is about to be made poet laureate and a friend who ought to be well informed says that it has always been a mistake to suppose that the Queen opposed him so strongly. The great opposition, according to this account, came from Gladstone, and was based chiefly on personal grounds. The appointment is, however, so strictly a royal prerogative and the Queen has so many things that the story seems to have a wishful origin. I am sure, however, that Swinburne will get it after all. London, August 18. It is reported that the Marquis of Lorne has written a play dealing with Scottish historical events, and that it has been accepted by one of London’s managers, who will produce it before the close of the present year. The question of the development of mining in British Columbia is at present attracting much attention in financial circles in the city, and it is probable that several mining experts will visit the province in the autumn. If the reports made by them of the result of their investigations shall be favorable a large influx of British capital may be expected. Despite the heavy rain storms which occurred during the entertainment of Emperor William of Germany by the Earl of Lonsdale, his Majesty's visit was a decided success. On the 12th instant the Kaiser shot fifty brace of grouse. The Emperor greatly astonished his suite by appearing in an ordinary shooting suit instead of the theatrical attire that he wears on his gunning expeditions in Germany. This costume consists of a braided tunic, high boots, a Tyrolean hat adorned with feathers. However, his Majesty discarded this on this occasion, having ordered from a London tailor a couple of hunting suits, grayish brown in color, and of a pattern similar to the Prince of Wales' shooting dress. The Kaiser, it is said, has decided to adopt this costume for hunting, and his example will be followed by a majority of his suite. His Majesty, during his visit to England, gave grave offence to Nazrulla Khan, the Afghan prince, who has for some time past been in England, by failing to ask the Prince to meet him, and by not sending him any message or letter. The position of the Prince excites public curiosity. It is known that he has received an almost unlimited number of hints from the Government to leave England, and that she has told him that he need not again visit any member of the Royal family, and so Nazrulla never leaves the grounds of Dorchester House, where he is staying. The governments of the countries also which it was Nazrulla's intention to visit have all positively refused to receive him. The refusal of the Sultan of Turkey has been made public. In it the Sultan states that, in compliance with a request of M. Nelidoll, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, he cannot receive the son of the Ameer if he should carry out his intention to visit Turkey. MISSIONARY MASSACRE The Commission Arrives at Ku Chenf - Several Arrests Made, Kiangsi, August 17. Mr. & O. company was favorably commented upon, the steamers from Jacques Cartier wharf and at Hochelaga being well patronized. Although dark clouds hovered over Longueuil the whole of the afternoon it was not until the evening, when the young folks were tripping the light fantastic in the new club house, that the rain commenced to fall, and up to midnight the heavy patter on the roof seemed to be endeavoring to keep time with the dance music. The threatening rain, however, was an incentive to the officials to start each race at the specified time, with the result that in addition to the keen competition the spectators were not only much pleased but were able to get under cover to discuss the several events. Following is the list of events, with the names of the respective winners: Yacht race, once round course - Lulu, Win; by an M. Good Luck, K; third - Alabisc, sailing, canoe, open: 2 miles - H.

The lightning almost completely stripped the clothing off his body. August 3 During the storm at Centre Tambridge yesterday afternoon lightning struck a farmhouse occupied by Edna Brownell and his family. The only daughter of Mr. Brownell, about 10 years old, was instantly killed. Eight or nine persons in the house were prostrated by the bolt. The house was badly shattered. Qkkmcc, August 4 The unceasing rain which has prevailed here for the last two weeks will prove fatal to the crops in this district. In many places hay was bundled ready for housing, and a very considerable loss will be sustained. C'nFFieKviLLR, Miss, August 4 Near Sparta church the other night a cloud burst, destroying crops for miles around. The Inman family, who were in camp near a rivulet, were surrounded by water and a little girl was drowned. Halifax, August 4 The barque Zenobia, which arrived at Parrsboro yesterday, was struck by lightning in the Gulf Stream, carrying away the top of the topgallant mast, striking the vessel in two places, and doing serious damage. St. Jonas, August 3 About 11:50 tonight a very heavy rainstorm set in, with hail from a quarter to a half inch in diameter. The hail lasted two or three minutes. The continuous rain, it is feared, will cause incalculable damage to the crops. Danvii, August 4 One of the greatest rain and hail storms ever witnessed in this vicinity passed over this village today, doing great damage to the crops and shade trees. Great damage was done to windows from the falling hailstones, which measured from one-eighth to three-eighths inches in diameter. S. Carsley, of Montreal, was interviewed by a Boston Herald reporter when in that city last week, when the following interesting conversation occurred: Mr. Carsley, what can you say of the state of trade in Canada? """"The prospects for the coming fall we consider good, particularly in Lower Canada, where the large quantity of rain has increased the hay crop, which is a very important element down there. All through Canada we consider the prospect good for fall trade."""" """"Is the mercantile soundness of houses in your section generally satisfactory?"""" """"I should say that our importing houses are sounder than they have ever been. One weakness, however, is the large number of 'supply stores' throughout the country; branch houses would be the term used in the United States; retail stores opened by wholesalers."""" """"In what way is that a detriment? It is supposed to extend business, is it not?"""" """"No; the object of opening those branch stores is to get rid of surplus stock that cannot be sold in a legitimate way; also for financial purposes."""" """"But how does this work to the detriment of general business?"""" """"By bringing more stores into existence than are necessary to do the trade for the particular locality where they are. A wholesale firm sends a quantity of goods to a city or town and opens up a store, placing the name of, perhaps, one of the employees over the door. They then go to some mercantile agency and get this employee rated as being worth, say from $10,000 to $20,000 when they well knew he is not worth a hundred dollars. Then they get his promissory notes and take them to the bank, refer the banker to his agency rating, and the banker, acting upon the rating, discounts the notes. If the real names of the bona fide proprietors of all the retail stores in Canada were over the doors, jobbers' names would appear very frequently all through the country."""" """"Is not that method somewhat similar to our practice here of raising money on accommodation paper?"""" """"Exactly the same, but our people seem to do it under cover, and your people do it openly. Our people seem to know how to use mercantile agencies, perhaps, better than you."""" """"Are the bankers aware of this method of raising so much money?"""" """"I have reason to believe that too frequently they are aware of it."""" """"Why do not they (the bankers) object to it, if it is a detriment to the mercantile community?"""" """"Because I believe that a large number of business houses, both in Canada and the United States, although not financially weak, are largely dependent upon the banks to keep them going, and the banks may bring on a crisis if they refuse to do this. I may say here that I do not think that the banks are aware of the enormous extent to which this thing is carried on."""" """"Is it true that with you, as with us, a large proportion of bank directors are also engaged in active mercantile business?"""" """"They are. There is a safeguard, however, in that the amount of the paper that the directors have under discount has to be reported to the Government monthly."""" """"Isn't a mercantile agency system a necessity as business is now transacted?"""" """"I believe that mercantile agencies are an evil in every way you take them, inasmuch as much of the information they give is second-hand. The only people who can give the standing of a man are those from whom he buys his goods and with whom he has transactions. To an embarrassed firm, or a firm that is financially weak, doing more business than the capital justifies, mercantile agencies seem to be a necessity in order to enable them to obtain credit."""" """"Can you tell us wherein the agency system of Canada differs from that in the United States?"""" """"I do not know how the mercantile agencies are conducted in the United States, but in Canada, when any of their subscribers fail, they are found to have been nearly always rated as being wealthy, up to the day of their failure. I maintain that mercantile agencies have no means whatever of knowing what a man is worth, and that the man who is fool enough to tell them what he is worth is knave enough to tell wrongly; that men's character and standing are too sacred to be dealt with as articles of merchandise, even by fairly inclined people."""" """"We do not see so many of your Canadian buyers in our markets as formerly. How do you account for that?"""" """"By our increased facilities for manufacturing."""" """"How many Americans visit Montreal during the summer?"""" """"Yes; the number seems to have increased of late years, and they have spent more money for merchandise the last two summers than they have for some years before."""" """"What are your views on commercial union?"""" """"I think that all the talk about commercial union is a perfect farce.""""

Four new schools are being built in Hinchinbrook, and the claim is made that no municipality in the district surpasses Hinchinbrook in its school buildings. The Bar of the district of Bedford held a special meeting at Sweetsburg last week, and adopted a resolution to the effect that in the opinion of the Bar the judge should reside at the chef-lieu of the district. The Cowansville Observer says: Crops of all kinds are looking splendidly. Hay will be somewhat damaged in harvesting by the rain which has fallen, but the crop will be abundant and of good quality. The Bedford Times says of Clarenceville: A number of good farms are offered for sale in this and adjacent parish of St. Thomas. Anyone intending to invest in farms would do well to give these parishes a visit. The Shawville Equity reports a prolific stalk of oats grown on the farm of Mr. Edward Dale, lot 8, range 4, this township. The stalk is double-headed, the heads containing 100 and 190 grains each respectively. A scheme is on foot to increase the water power of the Coaticook River by damming Norton Lake and the Averill Ponds, and so create a reserve of water for the dry season. The land is expected to cost $5,000 or $6,000 independent of the works. Some Waterloo people who imagined that the Salvation Army would one of those like boys die a natural death, have been put out by the new female captain, who promised last Sunday that the """"Salvation Army will stay in Waterloo till Gabriel blows his trumpet, and don't you forget it.""""

Mails, of Melbourne, and Profonlain, of South Durham, were the judges. Their decision was: 1st Mr. Hen Reed, Ulverton; 2nd Mr. William Hall, Kirkdale; 3rd Mr. I. Late barley looks also as if the rain had affected it, but dry weather would do much yet to put it right. Although this is the first of August about half of the hay is still in the field; part of it standing in water, and all difficult to cut and haul from the exceeding softness of the soil. A dry spell would be gratefully welcomed. Rivers and creeks are as high as they generally are at the close of April. Train Leave Montreal FROM WINDSOR STREET STATION 9:00 A.M. WAD-EL-JUMI ALSO KILLED. Imprisoned William's Ovation in England Irene h lect lona 1 Tourist Murdered in Scotland. Cairo, August 4 Gen. Grenfell engaged the Dervishes near Toski yesterday and completely routed them. Wad-el-Jumi, the Dervish leader, was killed. The Dervish loss was 1,500 killed and wounded. The Egyptian loss was slight. Besides Wad-el-Jumi, the slain on the Dervish side include twelve Emirs and nearly all the fighting men. Fifty standards were captured by the Egyptians. General Grenfell marched out of Toski at 5 o'clock in the morning with a strong reconnoitering force of cavalry and camelry and advanced close to the Dervish camp. Making a feint of retiring he drew the whole of Wad-el-Jumi's force to a point within four miles of Toski. Here the Egyptian infantry were held in readiness for an attack, and a general action was at once begun. The Dervish Leader Killed The Dervishes made a gallant defense, but were driven from hill to hill. The Egyptian cavalry made a succession of effective charges, in which Wad-el-Jumi and the Emirs were killed. After seven hours of hard fighting the Dervishes were completely routed. Later particulars say that the Dervishes fought desperately, throwing themselves upon the advancing columns repeatedly and refusing quarter. The crisis of the battle was reached when the Dervishes attempted to burn the extreme right of the Egyptians. Then the cavalry here swept through the lines of the enemy breaking them up. The steadiness of the troops was admirable. The cavalry pursued the retreating rebels for miles. General Grenfell ordered the gunboats to pick up fugitives and wounded. Gen. Grenfell's Official Report Gen. Grenfell, in his official report of yesterday's battle, says the Dervishes made repeated and desperate charges upon his men. They were met by the infantry in line of battle, supported by the Twentieth Hussars and the Egyptian cavalry. The Egyptian horse artillery did excellent service. The Dervishes numbered 3,000 fighting men. The British troops will now return to Cairo. The Khedive has sent congratulations to Gen. Grenfell. It has been decided that a permanent occupation of Surras is necessary for the protection of the frontier. A movement upon Dongola is deemed useless unless the Government assents to the view of English generals, that Berber should be held as the true key to the Soudan. The latest advices give the Egyptian loss as 17 killed and 13 wounded. One thousand Dervishes were made prisoners.

The Valois folks were not in the best kind of good luck on Saturday in two respects, while in one they had nothing to complain of. Valois had very bad weather and only managed to capture one first, but this drawback was made up for by the large number who went from the city to look on. Misfortunes began early in the day; and everybody said it was just the same luck as Valois usually had. It ruined; it partially dried up; it got damp and muggy; it got sunshiny; it got damp again; it discovered a couple of unoccupied squalls that enjoyed themselves to their heart's content with the yachts; it turned out a rainbow, which was made prettier by a river steamer incorporating itself in the multicolored mist; it blew a gale; it calmed down again; the rainbow promised good weather; but Noah's celestial men was this time a farce, a delusion and a mate, for it rained again, and rained hard, the pluvial genii just stopping long enough three or four times to get breath and a fresh start. In the beginning the lake and sky were blended in a harmonious blue; then both got leaden; there was a very perceptible ripple in the waters; the rain came down in straight spurts as if squirted from a celestial syringe; it came down hard that it flattened down any tendency to ripple which the lake had previously flattered itself with; the streams of rain were almost countable in a given area, and each stream made a little continuous hole in the dull grey of the water, sending out perfectly made little vibratory rings which met and joined each other till the whole surface looked like an immense piece of aqueous chain mail, with just the suspicion of some undulating power underneath, which latter force was particularly perceptible from the breakwater of logs which protected part of the course. Damp and dreary and drizzly; with spots of sunshine here and there, were the conditions which accompanied the seventh annual regatta of the Valois Boating Club. It would have been one of the most successful of the season had the weather been favorable. As it was there were nearly a thousand people scattered over every point of vantage on the bay. Those who waited for the 2 o'clock train had the satisfaction of waiting in the cars until half-past 2, when the start was made which brought them to the course shortly after 3 o'clock, after the sailing events had been started. The handicap yacht race was a great success, at least in the number of starters; and as the handicaps were given at the start the spectators knew when each boat crossed the line who were the winners, without muddling themselves with the mysterious workings of time allowances. In this race a surprise was in store for the yachtsmen, the Virginia, which was excellently handled and made to carry every stitch she could bear, finishing first and winning the race. The Minnie A crested the line at 3m 25s later, and the Jiabel 11m 25s after the winner. It was the Virginia's race, although on actual sailing time the Minnie A beat her 1m 25s. Following are the starters and their handicap allowances: Limit B, teze allows 1 min, White (Squall) allows 1:80, Virginia 1:30, Chaperon 2:00, Pearl 2:30, Mabel 4:00, Black Eagle 4:00. To ride to Valois, there was a small turnout Saturday afternoon for a ride to Valois, owing, no doubt, to the threatening look of the weather and the strong wind blowing, but all the same old-timers, who care nothing for rain and wind, turned up under command of Capt. Harlow who, by the way, had just returned from his holidays, having taken a trip through the West. There was a general shaking of hands by the members before the start. The wind along the Lachlino road was very strong and the roads were not in the best condition. On arrival at Lachlino a regular storm came on with rain, but the boys in blue kept on the road to Valois, arriving there about 4:30 after a very tiresome trip. Master Bertie Lane turned out and did the trip in good style. The Grand Trunk Football Club further increased their record last Saturday by defeating the East End Thistle on Logan's Farm by eleven goals to nil, which makes their record 18 goals won; lost none for this season. The friendly match between the St. Gabriel Quelling Club and the Montreal Club commenced on Saturday last on the St. Gabriel grounds; seven rinks were played, but owing to the absence of one of the Montreal club players, could not be finished, but will be completed this evening. Mr. I. Marsh, of the Dominion Club, was chosen as referee, and his services were very frequently called into requisition owing to the close playing of several of the players.",

AN ALDERMAN'S COMPLAINT About the Blockades of Bleury Street. Alderman Jean D. Villeneuve Ward. The Alderman and the Foreman, The Road Committee met yesterday afternoon, there being present Ald. Prefontaine (chairman), W. Kennedy, P. Kennedy, J. B. Dufresne, Brunet, and Dubuc. After the usual routine business had been transacted, Ald. Jannotte introduced a deputation of St. Catherine Street property owners and stated their grievances. They had to complain that the sewer on St. Catherine Street, between Panet and Papineau Streets, was in bad order. It was made twenty-two years ago, and was insufficient for present purposes, as whenever there was a heavy rain the water flooded the cellars along the street, causing great damage. Ald. Dubuc spoke in favor of action being taken in this matter, and pointed out that a similar condition of affairs existed on Ontario Street, but he thought the Health Department should take the initiative. Ald. Jannotte pointed out that, as the new pavement was being laid on St. Catherine Street, this matter required immediate attention, so as to prevent the necessity of having to tear up the new pavement to build the sewer. On motion of the chairman, the affair was left to a subcommittee, consisting of Ald. Brunet, Dubuc, Wilson, and Mr. St. George, the city surveyor, who were to have authority to act in the matter. Then the aldermen engaged in a desultory chat, and as there was no sign of business, Alderman P. Kennedy made the suggestion that they adjourn and go to see the lacrosse match. Business was then temporarily resumed and Alderman Thompson was given a hearing, as he wanted to make a suggestion. He dwelt upon the unsatisfactory condition of the drains generally, and suggested that the committee recommend to the council that all matters relating thereto be left to a standing committee on drainage. In his opinion, not until this was done would the present unsatisfactory state of affairs be remedied. The Chairman, however, was of the opinion that there were too many committees who had to do with the streets and, as most of the aldermen agreed with him, no action on Ald. Thompson's suggestion was taken. A COMPLAINT. Aid. Cunningham was then allowed to speak with reference to the grievances of the business men on Bleury Street in regard to the drain now being made on that thoroughfare. He pointed out that last year the water pipes were laid on Bleury Street, thus blocking traffic and interfering with business; this year a drain was being made from St. Jacques Street to Dorchester and he understood that next year it was their intention to extend this to St. Catherine Street. He did not see, nor did the business men he had come there to represent, why the whole could not be completed this year, thus having the nuisance over and done with at once. No one saw any objections, and instructions were given for action accordingly. A CHARGE OF INCIVILITY. Aid. Villeneuve also had a complaint to make. He complained about the incivility of Foreman Rousseau, who had charge of the street improvements in St. Jean Baptiste Ward. He, himself, had only recommended one man to be taken on the works, but the foreman had returned his letter unopened. He had treated Dr. Germain most uncivilly, and whenever he (Aid. Villeneuve) met the foreman he turned his head and looked the other way, for fear he might be spoken to about some much-needed improvements. The sidewalks were in a most disgraceful condition; in fact, they had never been worse when the ward was a small village; and when Mr. Rousseau was spoken to about the matter he promised to do something, but never did it. No attention was paid to their remonstrances. Aid. Dubuc and Aid. Wilson defended Mr. Rousseau. Everybody spoke at once. Mr. St. George tried to obtain a hearing to defend Mr. Rousseau and explain to Aid. Villeneuve, but could not. The Chairman said there were grounds for complaint in regard to the condition of the sidewalks in St. Jean Baptiste Ward, but not more than in any other. This was not the question, however. Mr. St. George, being allowed to speak, said the sidewalks were in a bad condition, but they had no money to better them. Whenever Aid. Villeneuve asked for anything he put it down to compute the cost. He defended Mr. Rousseau, saying that he could not lay a sidewalk or repair one without coming to him (Mr. St. George) for instructions. Aid. Villeneuve: Let me interrupt you to let you know how matters stand. Mr. Rousseau stated to one of the assessors that St. Jean Baptiste should never have been annexed. Mr. St. George had stated the same thing himself, for the reason that when it was annexed the streets were in a very bad order and they had not since had the money for repairs. When Mr. Villeneuve saw the official statement he would be satisfied that the best possible had been done. Aid. Villeneuve with some animus reiterated his statements about Mr. Rousseau. """"I know,"""" he said, """"that he is the enemy of St. Jean Baptiste Ward."""" Mr. St. George warmly defended his foreman, saying he was a most efficient workman and it was most unfair to so abuse a man who had no chance of defending himself, and who, in doing as he did, had only acted under his (Mr. St. George's) orders. Aid. Villeneuve: He does not obey his orders. I would like Aid. Brunet, who lives near, to give me half an hour and I would convince him of the truth of my statements about the bad order of the sidewalks. Aid. Brunet was willing to make the examination and report to the Road Committee and let it report to the council. Aid. Villeneuve: We have been annexed five years and not a cent has been spent on seven streets. Then after all this talk had been talked and nothing done, Mr. St. George was instructed to inquire into Aid. Villeneuve's complaints. The Market Committee. A meeting of the Market Committee was held yesterday morning, Aid. M alone in the chair. Messrs.

The highest flood which has been known in this section since 1850, with one exception, visited the valley of the Canisteo this morning. After a night of unusually hard rain at 8 o'clock this morning a third of the city was inundated. Crosby Creek was sweeping down Canisteo Street and covering the Erie yard. Canacadea Creek was overflowing, as was the river. The fire department was called out and did good work in securing bridges and buildings. The Erie is completely tied up, no through trains running since midnight, when train No. 6 went up the western division, but that has been stopped at Andover all day, unable to go either way. Three through trains have been lying at this city all day, one is at Addison and a fifth at Cameron, with no prospect of an opening before morning. It is now raining heavily and the streams are rapidly rising again, and unless it stops within an hour disastrous results will follow. Advices from Canisteo report that the village is completely under water and at the mercy of the stream. Almond and Alfred Centre are badly flooded and much damage has been done. Advices from Wellsville say that the water is unusually high at that place and all the bridges in that section are gone. At Corning many houses are surrounded and much damage done. The Northern Central has trouble at Watkins, where the tracks are flooded and washed out. ANOTHER RAILWAY HORROR. Albany, September 10.

The engineer on the train noticed the danger signals and stopped his engine about 300 feet from the crossing. Shortly afterwards he was given the signal to go ahead and obeyed. At the crossing, however, owing to a misplaced switch, the passenger train was sent onto a track on which was standing an engine with steam up attached to a loaded freight train of thirteen cars. The passenger train clashed into the freight train, but beyond a general shaking up of the passengers no one was injured. The Steamboat Express always passes the Lumber Street crossing at a high rate of speed and had the train been stopped for some reason or other above the crossing, it would have run into the freight train with terrific force and a number of the passengers would have undoubtedly been killed. TRAIN WRECKERS IN COURT. Troy, September 10. John Kiernan and John Cordial, two of the Knights of Labor charged with wrecking the Montreal Express last Monday night on the Central Hudson Railroad, were arraigned before County Judge Gilfiith this morning. The prisoners pleaded not guilty to a charge of placing obstructions on the track and the examination was adjourned till Saturday at 11 a.m. Lee gave each of the prisoners money. They were taken back to the Troy jail. Reed was not arraigned and it was stated that he is still a prisoner in Albany. The affidavit of A. Harrington, assistant superintendent of the Central Hudson Railroad, charges five men with the offense: John Reed, John Cordial, John Kiernan, Thomas Cain, and Arthur Buett. It is said Buett fled the next morning after the wreck. His right name is said to be Buell. Troy, N.Y. ESTABLISHED - 1880. Capital, $100,000. JOHN G.

18830205,historical,rain,"P for Cumberland County died at his home in Pittsburgh this morning. Another warrant has been issued against the young man Guy, now under arrest for misappropriating $5,000 from the Halifax Bank. On a previous occasion, he appropriated $2,000 belonging to the Bank. Cleveland, February 3. Flood and fire caused widespread damage here today. The rain began last evening and has been falling continuously for more than twenty-four hours. The Cuyahoga River and its tributaries have overflowed their banks and are still rising, with small prospects of the rain ceasing. Houses, barns, and factories in the valley are inundated. The damage will be large. No loss of life is yet reported. Early this morning, the waters of the Kingsburg River rose beyond their usual height and spread over hundreds of acres of the lowlands surrounding a leaky petroleum still of the Standard Oil Works located a considerable distance above the company's main works. The escaping oil refuse swept away down the stream and was carried under the boilers of the Great Western Oil Works, which were nearly submerged. The oil ignited and floated to the tank containing 50,000 barrels of crude petroleum, which was fired and exploded, spreading the blazing oil in all directions. Some of it was carried to Merall & Morgan's paraffine works, which were also fired. The flaming flood next attacked the Standard Oil Company's works, located in the valley, one after another of which took fire, until tonight five twelve-thousand-barrel tanks, two two-thousand-barrel tanks, four stills, the agitator, engine house, five hundred feet of railway trestle, and various small works are destroyed, and not less than 50,000 barrels of oil consumed. The loss is estimated at from $150,000 to $300,000. The machinery in the still is worth $270,000. The fire engines have been working all day, and a large force will be required all night. Later, tonight the eighth large storage tank of the Standard Oil Works exploded. The loss of oil thus far will be 61,000 barrels, worth $100,000. Midnight. The conflagration is thought to be under control and the wind has changed, turning the flames back over the burned district, though no prediction can be made as to what the fire may do, as the water may at any time break in the tank and scatter the burning oil. The Standard Company's loss may reach a quarter of a million. The insurance is small. At midnight the river is booming and rain falling steadily. This evening a schooner was torn from its moorings and hurled against the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio Railway bridge, the draw of which is so severely wrenched that cars cannot pass, thus destroying southern connections. Cleveland, Ohio, February 4. The fire at the Standard Oil Works is nearly exhausted. The scene of the conflagration resembles chaos. The loss will be at least $300,000. The flood reached its highest point at noon today. The flats are covered with floating lumber, and the elevators, iron works, mills, packing houses, and freight houses are more or less submerged. It is estimated that twenty-three million feet of lumber and 10,000,000 to 15,000,000 shingles are washed away. In the New York, Pennsylvania & Ohio freight house, the cars are submerged to the floors. The company refuses freight for the present. Fifty horses at lumber yards stood all night in the water up to their breasts and were rescued with difficulty today. Two mills of the Cleveland Paper Company containing forty tons of manufactured paper were submerged nearly to the top of the first story. The tug Florence capsized and sank. Schooners and steamers were tossed about but rode through without much injury. The lower central way bridge is broken. The district all about presented the appearance of a lake dotted with chimneys, roofs of buildings, and lumber piles. The freshet is the most destructive ever known. The water is higher than since the great flood of 1850, and the damage scarcely less than a million, and perhaps much greater. The weather turned rapidly cold today. Two freight trains went through the bridge near Munster, and a man was killed and another lost his leg. Much stock has been lost in the country, and bridges have been carried away in every direction. New York, February 3. The Pennsylvania and Ohio Valley Railway tracks are flooded, disabling the latter badly. The bridge of the Pittsburgh, Cleveland & Toledo Railway is threatened. The water swept away John Kennedy's house and Mrs. Kennedy scarcely saved her three children. Mary Strapp was drowned. Harrison Greer and his three children were washed out of their houses but were rescued. It is raining steadily, threatening further destruction. Akron, Ohio, February 3. It has been raining steadily since Friday night. The entire region is flooded. The Little Cuyahoga has risen three feet in four minutes. In Middleburg, most of the factories are submerged. The Hydraulic Company's new dam is washed away. Indianapolis, February 3. It has been raining and sleeting for the past thirty hours, and is still raining hard. Streams are swollen and trains delayed. Telegraph communication is cut off between Lafayette and Kankakee, and the lines are down for miles. Delaware, Ohio, February 4. The freshet is the worst ever known here. The Suspension Bridge is swept away, and two other bridges are expected to go. Families living near the river were rescued in boats. Mount Vernon, Ohio, February 4. The Kokomo River is booming. One house is surrounded by water, and the family is cut off from help. A bridge on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was carried away while a freight train was crossing, and the locomotive and part of the train sank out of sight. The train hands escaped except a brakeman, who was drowned. Warren, Ohio, February 4. The rolling mill is flooded, and the factories on the flats are so inundated that work must be suspended for several days. Piqua, Ohio, February 4. The first ward is under water to the second floors. All available boats are used in rescuing the people. Every house at the east end of the town is flooded. Rossville is completely under water. No passenger trains are running on the Pan-Handle or Dayton & Michigan railroads. McKeesport, Pennsylvania, February 4. Last night the ice gorge broke and the whole central part of the town was flooded. This flood subsided, and then a third of the city was submerged in consequence of the ice gorge in French Creek. Over 300 families were rescued by boats. There is much suffering from exposure and cold. The gasworks are under water and the city is in darkness. No trains can enter or leave the city. Ashtabula, Ohio, February 4. The drawbridge at the mouth of the river is gone, and the Nickel Plate bridge at Willoughby is swept away. Titusville, Pennsylvania, February 4. There is a flood on Oil Creek that went down this afternoon and two young men drowned. The water is slowly falling. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, February 4. The Allegheny River and tributaries have overflowed their banks, washing away bridges, houses, and barns, damaging property between Pittsburgh and Oil City to the amount of several hundred thousand dollars. The rise came suddenly, and many people barely escaped. A number of coal barges and twenty rafts were swept away from here this afternoon. The loss will be a hundred thousand dollars. The river is still rising, and the lower portion of Allegheny City and the south side are threatened with inundation. Residents are moving. At points above, the damage is estimated at a quarter of a million dollars. Columbus, Ohio, February 4. The Scioto River is higher than ever known. A large portion of the city is under water. The loss is enormous. Indianapolis, February 4. Floods are causing serious damage throughout this state. Arrival at Hamilton, Bermuda. Warm welcome by the people. Hamilton, Bermuda, January 31. Halifax, February 4. The fortnight of suspense with regard to the movements of the Princess Louise was ended on Sunday last when the Orinoco arrived from New York, for then it became known that Her Royal Highness, attended by Miss McNeill, Miss Hervey, and Mr. Josephus Hagot, had embarked on H. S. Some months ago, the head of the Criminal Investigation Department organized a system of espionage similar to the method adopted in Pennsylvania in bringing the Molly Maguires to justice. In connection therewith, Jotkinson, the Director of the Department, visited London some time ago and conferred with Sir Vernon Harcourt, Secretary of the Home Department. As a result, men in public stations have been more vigilantly guarded, especially the Marquis of Hartington and Sir Wm V. Harcourt. The French police undertook to protect Gladstone while in France. Dublin, February 4. Over a hundred persons suspected of being connected with secret organizations have left the city.

Meteorological Office, Toronto, February 5. The depression which extended from Texas to Indiana on Saturday morning has contracted and moved northeastward across the lakes, and is now passing off the Atlantic coast to Newfoundland, causing a general fall of snow throughout the Lake region and eastern Canada, and rain in southern Ontario, whilst the higher area then over the Northwest has moved southeastward, and is now passing over and to the south of Ontario, bringing fair and colder weather. PROBABILITIES. Lakes: Moderate to fresh northwesterly to southerly winds, fair to clear cold weather, with light snow in some localities. St. Lawrence, Upper and Lower: Moderate to fresh westerly to southwesterly winds; fair to clear cold weather. Gulf and Maritime: Fresh northwesterly to southwesterly winds; fair to clear cold weather. Six young men belonging to respectable families in Philadelphia determined to rob a merchant of theirs, named Leon, by pretending to rob him. They threw him down and robbed him of his watch and chain, leaving the part that conceals art; the thief was marked when he slid an expensive oil painting under his coat. Boston Transcript. An exchange says the city of Washington is full of Congressmen and thieves. Why this redundancy of expression? The Boston Journal. Quite so: Naturally, the initial questions propounded to the host by his well-informed and experienced guest are: How is your water? Is it pure and untainted? Free from gases and pollutions? And the drainage, are there bad gases continually passing through the house, arising from an imperfect drainage? Few are the hotel managers that can answer these pointed questions affirmatively. Bumbleton gave forth his first conundrum the other day. He was out of a conceit, and too many of the best (vacant) seats. The usher came to him and gently led him to a bench in the rear. Then he asked Jones, """"Why am I like an old pair of shoes?"""" and Jones replied, """"Because you're no account."""" But Bumbleton wanted to say something about being reseated. Mutual Herald, Astrological Predictions for 1883: In 1883, Mars will be the ruling planet. The influence of this heavenly body upon the irascible humor in man and animals is well known. Particular care should be taken by persons of a naturally impatient disposition to avoid outbursts of temper, especially during the oppositions of Mars to the moon, which occur on or about January 22, February 21, March 22, April 19, May 17, June 15, July 14, August 12, September 10, October 8, November 6, and December 3 and 31. At such times, also, bulls should be restrained from running at large, and water should be frequently thrown upon dogs to see if they manifest any symptoms of hydrophobia. On New Year's Day, Mars is in trine with Saturn and Uranus, these planets occupying respectively the terrestrial signs of Capricorn, Taurus, and Virgo. This is an unusually unfortunate aspect, and the events that accompany it will cast a gloom over the New Year felicitations. The aspect will continue until Mars enters Aquarius on the 31st of January. All acts of even necessary violence should be abstained from or deferred until this date. The corporal punishment of children even should not be indulged in. Better allow their misdeeds to accumulate and punish them in the aggregate after all danger has passed away. Jupiter at this time is retrograding in Gemini and can offer no alleviation to the evil aspect already mentioned. Jupiter is stationary on St. Valentine's Day, and engagements made then may be total. The conjunction of Mars and Mercury on St. Patrick's Day indicates that large amounts of money will be collected for the liberation of Ireland. The first days of May will be lovely, with a little rain at night. Poetry of some merit may now be written, and a thorough revolution in dress and cookery expected. On the 4th, events fatal to domestic happiness will be extremely liable to occur. Startling developments in aristocratic families will now be made. No destructive frosts will happen in this month, and corn-planting will be early. From the 2nd of June to the 13th of July, a severe drought will take place. On the 19th, a European sovereign will die. On the 20th, an ocean steamship will take fire, with great destruction of life. The 4th of July will again be signalized this year by an event of great national importance. On the 17th, however, an instance of solicitors' official misconduct will come to light. Much needed rainy weather will begin on the 13th, and thenceforth the summer will be intensely hot. The aspect of the asteroid Melpomene now indicates great disaster to members of college faculties, a railroad accident being the probable danger threatened. The 13th will be a day of peculiar horror. August will be fine until the 31st. Lunatics should be very careful of their behavior during the whole of that month. Fits and falling sickness will be quite general after the middle of October. Avoid trifling, tumultuous, or incongruous days. November will be fine and frosty. A new washing machine will be patented on the 11th. The cocoa's excellence is about three times the strength of the best homemade or pie cocoa, in which the exponents of fatty matter, composing fifty percent of the cocoa nib, is disguised by the addition of arrowroot, sugar, etc. In the preparation of the cocoa essence, about two-thirds of this latter matter is removed, thus rendering any admixture of sugar, arrowroot, etc., unnecessary and producing an article long desired by many men, and by those who require perfectly genuine, and at the same time, a thoroughly wholesome and nutritious cocoa.

18880903,historical,rain,"THIS CHOPS IN QUEBEC, A Current Account of Farming Done by the All-Continuous Rain, Huntingdon Gleaner To what extent the crops have been injured by the broken weather of the past fortnight will not be known until threshing is general. The loss has been so serious that the harvest can no longer be spoken of as an extra one. During the storm of Sunday morning many fields of dead ripe grain were threshed by the wind. That losses by lightning have been few is gratifying. The same paper's Athlone correspondent says: A good many farmers have suffered more or less from the sprouting of grain as well as shelling, the seed in many cases being left on the ground. A few along the river had small patches floated away entirely. It is hoped that what promised to be an abundant harvest will yet be an average one, although somewhat damaged. Err'ord Times Harvesting is very much retarded by the continued wet weather. Considerable grain will be lost in consequence, and the straw will be a poor article of fodder the coming winter, which must have a tendency to raise the price of hay. On Saturday morning last, cut grain was found in many places lying in pools of water, and the grounds so saturated with water as to invite it too soft for a team to move on. Not for twenty years have I seen so wet a harvest season. This is not a prophecy, mind you now, """"Coming events cast their shadows before,"""" but these events leave a shadow behind, for at this writing it is still overcast, with heavy shadows, and no appearance of fair weather. Hit 1,1110ml Cuanliun; It has rained 21 days during this month, and it was getting alarming. All round the grain has badly lodged when it was fully ripe; though fortunately, a good deal of it is only ripe now. Some unharvested hay has been out in cock for three weeks and of course is spoiled. Farmers have been very busy in the field for the past three days (Thursday) and it is more to be hoped that we shall not get any more rain. It has been the wettest season for twenty years. Waterloo Advertiser, The weather for the past three weeks has done incalculable damage to the crops. Just as harvesting was beginning, the rain came on and there have not been two fair days in succession since. The grain that was cut is practically ruined by the prolonged wet and standing crops have been injured to a deplorable extent. The damage extends to wheat, oats, barley, corn and potatoes. Three weeks ago the crop prospects were excellent and the farmers in capital spirits. The unparalleled rains since have changed all that and the harvest will be much poorer than was confidently anticipated. There would be some hope were the weather to come off fine now, but it is not settled yet and more rain may be expected before harvesting operations can be advanced a great deal. Altogether the prospect is not a pleasant one. St. Johns News, Continuous rain has done much damage to the crops. Even in high and well cultivated lands serious loss may be counted upon, while in the low lands and in the more poorly tilled farms the destruction is sad to contemplate. Whole fields of wheat, oats and peas have been submerged by the water, and in other cases grain has sprouted badly or more or less injured in quality. It is also feared that potatoes will rot, but fortunately these fears are not yet realized. Everywhere in the province the ground is like a sponge, and unless there is soon a change for the better many tillers of the soil will have a hard time of it this winter. CROWLEY IS DEAD, The Famous Chimpanzee In New York Succumbs to Pneumonia, Crowley, the famous chimpanzee of Central Park, died a little before noon yesterday of pneumonia. As the end drew near weakness compelled him to lie down. He rolled over on his back, drew up his legs, clutched his lower jaw by the teeth with both hands, uttered a farewell cry of anguish, and his day was over. Next to Crowley's cage is one occupied by his chimpanzee sweetheart, Miss Kilty O'Brien. Kilty knew that Crowley was sick, as was evident by her tender regard for his welfare as manifested by her conduct at the bars. She would sit there by the hour with her face pressed against the cold iron and she would cast sympathetic glances at her miserable lover while he rolled in convulsions on the floor. Kilty did not give a sign that she knew of Crowley's death until his body was being taken away. Then she began to whimper and moan and shed tears in a way that was almost human. She remained in a melancholy mood all day. Today Crowley's body will be transferred to the Museum of Natural History, at Eighth Avenue and Seventy-seventh Street. There it will be prepared by Prof. Richard, son and casts made of the head and shoulders. An autopsy will be made by Dr. THE CROPS' CONDITION, The Weather Generally Favorable for Harvesting in the States, WASHINGTON, September 2, The weather crop bulletins for the week ending September 2 state that the weather during the week has been unusually favorable in the greater portion of the corn belt, but too much rain occurred in the extreme southern portions of the states bordering on Ohio. Reports from Kansas indicate that the corn crop is secure and past possible injury from frost. Light frosts occurred in the upper lake regions, probably causing some damage to the cranberry crop in Wisconsin. The weather has been too cold in Michigan to favor a rapid growth of corn, but no injury is reported to the crop in that state and cutting will commence next week. Reports from Kentucky show that the heavy corn crop in that state has been somewhat damaged by recent rains and that the season has been sufficiently favorable to secure an average tobacco crop. The heavy rains have damaged the growing crops in cotton and sugar regions. Chicago, September 2, The Farmer's Review says it is now possible to arrive at a fairly definite conclusion regarding the yield of winter wheat and oats as shown by the strong returns which we have been receiving from our crop correspondents during the past two weeks. Our reports do not, however, tell the whole story of the returns for in some localities, as parts of Dakota, Minnesota and Northern Iowa, but a portion of the crop has been threshed. The report received to date may, however, be taken as fair evidence of what will be found to be the average yield. Yield of winter wheat: Illinois A full summary reports of threshing place the average yield at 18 bushels per acre, the highest average yield is 29 bushels per acre; Wisconsin, 21 bushels per acre; Indiana, 12 bushels per acre; Ohio, 11 bushels per acre; Missouri, 18 1-3 bushel; Kentucky, 13 1/2; Kansas 20 1/2. H. Johnston and Elijah Beckler, president, teller and solicitor of the Savings Bank at Roseland, have disappeared. About $30,000, comprising the entire funds of the bank, are also missing. Minor Items, The heavy rain has ruined the crops in the vicinity of Vicksburg, Miss. Window glass workers throughout the continent will resume work on Tuesday. It is estimated that the reduction of the public debt during August was $7,700,000. A waterspout caused much damage on the Cincinnati & Southeastern railway on Friday. Over 1,000 children are reported to have died from measles in Santiago de Chile in the last two months. The Field Biscuit and Cracker Company of San Francisco has assigned. The liabilities are $100,000. The Department of State has not as yet received any information confirming the reported rejection of the Chinese treaty. Word has been received at Pueblo of the drowning of six cowboys northwest of Pueblo County just west of Pike's Peak, Colorado. A collision occurred a few days ago between a band of Utes and the Piutes in the Paradox Valley, Col., and several on both sides were killed. Jay Gould has ordered the construction of a new union depot at St. Louis, to take the place of the old sheds that have been a disgrace to that city for years. The building is to cost $100,000. The Chicago, Santa Fe and California has cut the rate on dressed beef from Kansas City to Chicago to 13 cents per 100 pounds. The tariff rate is 20 cents. This action is the direct outcome of the war in livestock rates with the southwestern roads. THE PLAGUE SPREADING, Terrible State of Affairs at Jacksonville A Refugee Stricken in Philadelphia, New Orleans, September 1, The Times-Democrat's special from Jacksonville, Fla., says Eleven new cases of yellow fever up to 1 o'clock and one death is what Dr. Neal Mitchell reports by telephone. This is a big report for so early in the day and it rather scares people as generally the forenoon list is light and the larger portion of new cases are reported from 5 to 6 p.m. The peculiar weather is driving the infection all through the city, and it is feared few will escape a touch of it. There will be so few people in town in a few days from now that hardly one can hope to escape the disease. Tomorrow an excursion train will leave here for North Carolina, in accordance with Surgeon-General Hamilton's suggestion and permission, and it will be filled, too. This is especially urged, now that the women and children are got out of the city, and great efforts are being made to send them off. The rush to Camp Perry continues, and those who intend to stay will be rather lonesome by next week. Jacksonville, Fla., September 2, Following is the official bulletin for the twenty-four hours ending 6 p.m., September 2: New cases of yellow fever, 24; deaths, 2; total number of cases to date, 258; total number of deaths to date, 34. A moderate cyclone passed over the city this afternoon. After the vortex went by there was a gale from the southwest accompanied by loud thunder, keen flashes of lightning and a heavy rainfall continuing several hours, clearing the atmosphere wonderfully and lowering the temperature, washing the surface of the streets perfectly clean, as well as carrying several hundred barrels of lime which had scattered abroad into the river. """"The effects of the storm,"""" said a leading Cuban physician today, """"will probably be excellent, on the whole tending to lessen materially the infection, but will be bad on the sick unless watched with great care. Many patients may have a serious backset in consequence of the change of weather."""" It is still raining. Clear, bright moderately cool weather is hoped for tomorrow. Washington, September 1, Surgeon-General Hamilton has received a dispatch from Philadelphia informing him that a case of yellow fever has been discovered there in the person of a Florida refugee, who passed the inspection at Waycross, Ga. The patient was sent to the municipal hospital. Philadelphia, September 1, In reference to the supposed case of yellow fever in this city it was impossible to obtain any information from the Board of Health as the office had been closed for the day before the news reached here from Washington. At the United States Marine Hospital it was learned that the refugee had been taken to the United States Marine ward in charge of Dr. Bailbacho and Dr. Heyer. Dr. Heyer, it is reported, found the case a doubtful one, with some indications in favor of the theory of yellow fever and made a report to the health authorities at once. Upon this report the patient was ordered to be sent at once to the municipal hospital.",

Not an alarm sounded recently but has been tumbled and the brigade puzzled as to what direction to go. Insurance men threaten to increase their rates.

QUEBEC, September 11 - The heavy rain storm to-day prevented the artillery competition from being continued. No. 3 Battery Quebec, which commenced firing yesterday morning, did not finish till four o'clock, having exceeded their time four hours. In consequence of this No. 2 and 5 Batteries of the Montreal Garrison, who were booked to commence at 1:30, only got to work at 4. No. 2 Battery managed to get through just at dark, but No. 3 had to lay over till the morning. The scores for No. 2 Battery with the 12-pounder at 1,200 and 1,500 yards are as follows: Lieut. Finlayson, 25; Corp. Morris, 22 and with the 40-pounder at the same ranges Sergeant Harper, 0; Gunner Murray, 0. The fact of Harper and Murray not scoring was principally due to the late hour at which they commenced firing, as it took them some time to judge their aim, and on account of this, what points they made by firing were lost by running over the ten minutes allotted to them; one point being deducted for every half-minute or fraction of nine. No. 5 Battery commenced firing at an early hour, the scores with the 12-pounder being: Corp. Drysdale, 22; Gunner Letcere, 0; and with the 40-pounder: Corp. Drysdale, 22; Corp. Henry, 23. The weather, although rainy, was calm and the light good, in fact, it has been one of the best days for artillery firing, although the men were exposed to torrents of rain which fell nearly all day. The Halifax team commenced three or four hours behind their time on account of former delay. In the first five rounds fired No. 1 detachment with the 64-pounder knocked two targets to pieces and made splendid direction in the other three shots. No. 2 detachment on their first shot with the same gun knocked another target to pieces, but the rest of the firing did not turn out so good, although they came close upon the heels of the English in aggregate scores. They lost a number of points on account of over-time deduction, caused principally by the slippery state of the battery platform. In fact on the first shot from the 64-pounder being fired it swung right off the platform into the ground - started, and it was only after wedging the planks by means of barriers in the shape of large cedar logs, spiked down, that the gun could be kept in its place. At one time the rain came down so heavily that the team had to seek shelter and stop firing for over an hour. This, with the time occupied in replacing the targets, kept them from finishing till near 3:30 p.m. They made the following score with the 64-pounder: Corp. Maxwell, 20; Corp.

The Prince Edward Island team then commenced firing, but had to postpone it till the morning after firing a few rounds, as it was getting too late to see the targets. Lieut.-Colonel Oswald's block at the camp, Island of Orleans, promises to prove a brilliant affair. Over two hundred invitations have been issued.

The very handsome Quebec Challenge Trophy is valued at $230. With the exception of the Queen's Cup all the prizes on exhibition are the workmanship of Mr. Beifert. OVA (SCOTIA) Naval movement still a camp at Halifax, September 11 - THE WEATHER, Toronto, September 11, 1 a.m. The depression which was over the lake region last night is now situated over the Gulf of St. Lawrence and an important area of high pressure covers the lake region and the Western States. Rain has fallen generally along the Lower St. Lawrence and in the maritime provinces, accompanied by an moderate gale in the gulf, and in the lake regions and the upper St. Lawrence the weather has cleared and become considerably cooler. Prominent winds are comparatively variable to northwesterly. A total of 1 percent on all postal rates has been applied from the 11th instant. The Alexandria Losses Awards France and the Chinese Declaration of War Paris, September 11 The government denies that China has declared war. The chambers will not be summoned to meet before October 16th. At Shanghai the Chinese are taking steps to obstruct the fairway at the outer bar. General Tso has been appointed military commander of the province of Fuh Kien, in which Foo Chow and Formosa are located. The naval commander of the province will be Chang Pi Lung. It is said that Patenotre received from the Tsung Li Yamen a declaration of war, but the ambassador refused to give the document official recognition, upon the ground of diplomatic usage, it being necessary that such a declaration should be made direct to the French government. A Nihilist proclamation Wahhaw, September 11 Thousands of copies of a Nihilist proclamation are circulated here. It is signed by the central committee, and says: """"In the struggle to sustain the people against the rule of the Czar we ought to have recourse to the same weapons as he uses. Our fight is now as it was ever, a fight against outrage. We have done justice on the journalist, Skirintsyk, whose death was wrongfully attributed to the violence of thieves, but he was executed by us as a spy. No traitor escapes."""" The police have failed to discover the source of the publication of the proclamation. The police seized a Nihilist at the railway station disguised as an officer of the guard. The time for the departure of the Emperor William for Hkiernevic is kept secret. Francis Joseph leaves on Sunday, and, after the imperial conference, returns on the 17th, going to the Tyrol to inaugurate the Vorarlberg railway. The Alexandria losses London, September 11 Earl Granville, through the English ambassadors, has informed the powers which participated in the recent Egyptian conference that the question of the Alexandria indemnities will be the first object of Lord Northbrook's mission to Egypt, and promises that early proposals will be made for the settlement of the question. A Cairo despatch to the Paris Temps goes further and says that the English government has submitted a proposal to the powers to pay the Alexandria indemnities in cash less twenty-five percent, or in full in installments extending over ten years. The failure to settle the indemnity causes great hardship. Already many have been obliged to sell the certificates of their awards to speculators at 50 percent discount. The result will be that when the settlement is made by the government usurers will have the benefit of the indemnity instead of the original creditors. An alternative route Cairo, September 11 In consequence of the falling of the Nile, General Wolseley has ordered preparations to be made so that if necessary the expedition can proceed from Debbeh to Khartoum via the desert route, though General Wolseley informs the government that he will adhere to the Nile route. The German in Africa London, September 11 Official communications have passed between the English Foreign Office and Germany upon the reported annexation by Germany of the African coast. It is reported that Bismarck repudiates the authorization of such annexation. Minor and personal The child born to the Comte de Paris last Tuesday was a son, not a daughter. The French have bombarded and temporarily occupied Mahanoro on the Madagascar coast. The Russian flagship Berlin has been anchored in a Korean port while the fleet remains at Nagasaki, waiting orders. It is said the German foreign office ignores the right of the Cape Colony government to annex any portion of the coast of Africa. THE CHOLERA OUTBREAK The sufferings in Naples Cases in Rome Death in Malta NAPLES, September 11 The situation here continues most distressing. The epidemic increases hourly. The misery and suffering are appalling. For the day ending at 9 p.m. there were 906 new cases and 328 deaths from cholera here, and elsewhere in Italy 150 cases and 99 deaths. It is thought the situation here is slightly improved. The King today again visited the hospitals and quarters of the poorer classes. The municipal authorities have prohibited all religious processions. Two hundred nurses have offered their services to the hospitals. ROME, September 11 The Catholic newspapers eulogize the bravery displayed by the King during his visit to Naples. Subscriptions have been opened in Milan to present the King a medal in commemoration of the event. Another death occurred here today believed to be from cholera.

There have been twenty-seven deaths at Montfort and twenty-seven deaths and forty at Alicante since the 1st of September. BY FLOOD AND STORM Damage by high water in Michigan and Wisconsin - A severe cyclone AMI, Mich., September 11 A violent thunderstorm occurred here yesterday. The rain fell over an inch in eight minutes. Thomas Scarf was struck by lightning and killed on the street. Another man's arm was broken, a house and mill were blown down, and 40,000 feet of lumber swept into the lake. CAIWNA FALLS, Wis., September 11 The most disastrous flood ever known is now upon us. The river has risen over 20 feet, and is still booming at the rate of a foot per hour. All the upper dams on Duncan Creek, which passes through the city, are out. A portion of the flood that ran that course reached here yesterday and swept every bridge, five in number, outside the city limits, with a large number of buildings, including K. Seib's planning mills, Caim feed store, and Bailey livery stable; also several Werner agricultural buildings. The loss in the city is estimated at $104,000. The worst is still to come, a dam threatens at Chain Lakes, Mich. September 11. A NEW K, French recognition of Iglesias' government Lima, September 11 The French minister to Peru was publicly received yesterday and presented an autograph letter from Grew recognizing Iglesias' government. All officers found bearing arms against the late government are to be tried by court-martial. The Buenos Ayres congress has voted five hundred thousand to effect a definite occupation of the Chaco territory. The expedition, commanded by the minister of war, leaves at the end of the month. The Bolivian minister, Vora Guzman, has presented his credentials and been publicly received. OXTA HIO LENTATIVES The Port Dalhousie drowning accident - Forest Fires TIVERTON, September 11 Fires are raging in the swamps along the lake shore in this vicinity. Large tracts of valuable cedar have been burned. A farmer near Port Elgin has lost his dwelling-house, barns, and almost his entire crop. Near Inverhuron a number of the residents have been obliged to watch their buildings night and day for the past week, and in some cases all the furniture has been removed from dwellings. Rain is eagerly looked for to stay the lamentable destruction of valuable timber and property that is going on. PORT DALHOUSIE, September 11 The names of the four young men drowned in the Welland Canal last night were Henry McEntyre, of Leamington, Ont. THE PHOTOGRAPHICAL DISPLAY Some of the Special Features of the Exhibition The Firemen's Parade this Morning Other Attractions The sixth day of the great Dominion fair passed off as successfully as its predecessors. Owing to the rain in the fore part of the day, the attendance was not so large as usual, but in the afternoon the attendance rapidly increased, until the grounds were well filled with spectators. The feature of the afternoon, outside of the regular show, was the programme of athletic sports which took place on the exhibition track and which passed off in a most satisfactory manner, the different events being all well contested. In the evening there was again a very large attendance and the display of the electric light contrasted finely with the mammoth display of fireworks which took place from the mountain and which was seen to splendid advantage from the grounds. Today's programme will include a grand parade of the Montreal Fire Brigade, which will take place on the Champ de Mars. Tomorrow will be the closing day of the great fair, and those who have not yet visited the grounds should not fail to do so. THE SWIMMING EXHIBITION The exhibition of swimming feats by Professor Riley, the Boston swimmer, which was announced to take place in the canal basin yesterday morning, came off on time and proved very successful. There was a fair attendance of spectators, who watched with much interest the daring feats of the aquatic wonder. Prof. Riley first jumped from the yardarm of the steamship Newfoundland, a distance of fifty feet, and accomplished the daring feat in safety. He also gave a display of fancy swimming in the basin, showing that he was a thorough master of his art. THE ATHLETIC SPORTS Considerable interest was manifested in the athletic sports which took place on the park side yesterday afternoon, the grandstand being thronged with spectators by the time the programme was commenced. The rain which had fallen during the early part of the day rendered the track rather heavy, but nevertheless the competitors came pluckily forward, and in some of the events the contest for first place was very keen. The time was taken in several instances, and is given below, but it must not be taken as infallible, as in one or two cases the time given would seem to indicate that the track was rather on the short side. The following were the field officers: Judges Messrs. Angus Grant, Alex. McGibbon.",

London, Ont, December 3 The Bee, Isaac Barkholder, of Winona, died suddenly at the residence of his daughter, Mrs. COMMERCIAL, Grain Office, Monday Evening, December 29 The improved tone which was noted in the Liverpool market on Saturday assumed more decided form today and extended all through the grain trade. It is generally admitted that the stock of wheat at the principal points of accumulation has been much depleted, which has caused buyers to become more anxious. The advance on this side has a stimulating effect, materially helping the improvement, and it now looks as if the market was fairly started on the upgrade. At Liverpool it was strong and advanced 1d per cental. Beerbohm's quotations were: Fair average red winter, 7; white Michigan, 7; red American spring, 6s 1d; and standard California, including club, 6s 9d. The public cable quotations were: Spring, 6s 1d; red winter, 6s 7d; No. 1 California, 6s 1d; and No. 2 red, 6s 1d. Corn closed at a decline of 1d per cental. Beerbohm quoted mixed maize at 5s 3d, while the public cable was 1d lower at 5s 5d. Canadian oats were unchanged at 5s 9d. Wheat at Mark Lane was strong and advanced 1s 1d per quarter, and corn was firm. Cargoes of wheat off the coast were firmer. Wheat and corn on passage or for shipment were the turn dearer. The English market wheat markets were firm, and so was the weather in the United Kingdom today. From all quarters there were stronger reports of the market, which seemed to have followed the lead set by Chicago, and which further stimulated the advance there. The news items were more in favor of the bulls, who found the market and its surroundings much after their own heart, which was the more appreciated by them after such a long spell of hope deferred. The opinion gained ground rapidly that, whatever the future may hold, the lowest figures on this crop have been touched. Heavy rains have cleared the snow from the winter wheat in many sections, which, it is feared, will expose it to serious injury by frost. Receipts are expected to fall off, and the visible supply must be very nearly at its maximum. Buying orders were larger and more frequent, and although some realizing was done everything was readily taken; cables were strong and the crowd have all flipped around to the bull side; in fact, it is the best bull market seen for many a day. Trading was active. It opened strong and a shade higher, then rose 1c to 1.5c, but toward the finish reacted and closed 1c to 1.5c above Saturday at 75c January, 75c February, 81c May. The corn pit was deserted, all the interest being centered in wheat. The market, however, although dull, was firm and closed 1c better at 35c year, 35c January, 37c May. Oats were quiet but firmer, closing 1c higher at 25c January, 25c February, 28c May. Rye was quoted at 62c December, 52c January, 53c February. Barley was unchanged at 58c cash. Today's inspection was 11 cars winter wheat, 209 spring, 303 corn, 58 oats, 10 rye, and 33 barley. Milraine, Bodman & Co, of Chicago, telegraphed W.J. Fairbairn as follows: The wheat market has continued very strong, closing at 82c May. There was liberal realizing by small local longs, but there was sufficient fresh blood to absorb the offerings, together with a decided increase in the number of outside orders. Cables were strong and 6d higher. The visible supply will probably show a small increase tomorrow, but the belief exists that it will be the maximum. Steady rain has fallen for forty-eight hours, clearing the ground of snow, which strengthens the bulls on the theory that a cold snap will injure the winter wheat. To say the least of it, it is a bull market. The heaviest operators on the floor are large buyers, and double up to bet on profits. Corn was almost dead, being entirely neglected, closing at 33c January. Packers were liberal sellers of hog products, which scattered the shorts who were the main support. There was covering of short pork and lard in order to buy wheat. Something has dropped on the December corn shorts in New York, who have had the price hoisted six cents per bushel on them, the market closing at 60c. The remote options were firmer and closed 1c higher at 48c January, 47c February, 47c May. Wheat was strong and advanced 1.5c, closing at 86c January, 86c February, 92c May. At Toledo there was a regular boom in wheat, during which prices rose 2c to 3c, No. 2 red closing at 74c January, 76c February, 81c May. Corn closed at 40c cash, 37c January, 39c May, and oats at 27c March. The Detroit wheat market was buoyant and advanced 2c to 2.5c, No. 1 white closing at 80c cash December, 80c January, 82c February. Wheat at Milwaukee was again very strong. This time it advanced 1.5c, No. 2 spring closing at 74c cash December, 73c January, 74c February.

A new and distinct form of disease which is afflicting many women. How some of them trained for complete restoration, perfect health, and superb physical beauty. A great London physician says that he notes a new and distinct form of nervous disease prevalent in certain women by worry and overwork in caring for the home. This is only too true. It is why we see so many ladies pale, weak, languid, and suffering from headaches and innumerable weak-nesses. They cannot stand the strain upon their nervous system. Many of them have found the means to sustain their failing strength, to give color to the cheeks, and new life and vigor to the body, in Paine's Celery Compound.

HEAVY RAINS AND MELTED SNOW CAUSE WIDESPREAD HAVOC. ALL TRAVEL INTERRUPTED. Valleys Turned Into Rivers and Farms Inundated. Portland, Ore., February 5. Heavy snow storms and rain south of here are causing very great damage to the railroads and telegraphs. The Willamette River, at Portland, has overflowed its banks, and the water is two or three feet deep in the streets of Portland. The Southern Pacific Railway, between Portland and Sacramento, has been practically abandoned for the past two or three weeks. There is great damage to the telegraph lines in all directions, and the Canadian Pacific have the only wires working out of Seattle. The Associated Press despatches from the east were transmitted last night over the Canadian Pacific wires from Chicago, via Montreal, the Western Union having no outlet. The Damage in Oregon. Jacksonville, Ore., February 5. A phenomenal rainstorm has prevailed in Southern Oregon since last Friday, which, in connection with the melting snows in the mountains, has caused the greatest flood known since that country was settled. The damage cannot be estimated as yet, for postal communication is so uncertain and limited that only surmises can be made of the ravages of the water. On the line of the numerous tributaries of the Rogue River, many small ranches have been badly damaged, if not ruined, and miles of fencing have been swept away. Much of the finest soil in the lower valley has been washed down to gravel and bedrock, and the spectacle of fields flooded, roads washed out, and bridges and culverts demolished is common. Valleys Turned Into Seas. The fertile Bear Creek region has not escaped the visitation. Part of the valley has presented the appearance of a turbid sea for days, and communication between its many towns has been almost suspended by the swollen streams. Bear Creek itself has borne along a great deal of wreckage, including fences, outbuildings, and even barns and houses, and has wrought much destruction in undermining and sluicing off the deep alluvium that composes its banks. In the Applegate region, there are few bridges left. Many people were obliged to leave their homes for safety. Great damage has been done to the mining interests of the section by the bursting of dams and reservoirs, the breaking and filling of ditches, and the loss of flume boxes and machinery. The Oregon and California railroad track in Southern Oregon has been washed away for miles, and the roadbed is seriously damaged along the whole line. There has not been a mail either north or south for weeks. No estimate can be made of the loss to the county in bridges and private property. Hundreds of thousands of dollars will not cover it. More than the Snow Blockade. St. Paul, Minn., February 5. The damage from the snow blockades in Oregon, California, and Southern Washington seems about to be followed by a much greater loss by flooding. The heavy snow filled valleys as well as the railroad cuts, and milder weather had begun to make way with the drifts, when last Friday an unusually heavy rain set in. It is reported that Portland is flooded and entirely cut off from the outside world, but the public reports of the Northern Pacific railroad officials indicate otherwise. The city may be partially under water, but Northern Pacific trains, it is stated, are arriving there from the east with comparatively little delay. From another source, it is learned that the Southern Pacific's California line is still blockaded and suffering severely from washouts along the streams, which are rising rapidly from the recent rains and melting snows. The latest information from Portland is that the Union Pacific line is again closed, this time owing to heavy rains, melting snows, and landslides along the Columbia River between The Dalles and Portland, where the road suffered so severely two years ago from the same causes.

18951011,historical,rain,"ML COST $400,080 Several New Intercepting Sewers Proposed by Mr St George THE FLOODING OF CELLARS In Great Part Caused by Outside Municipalities-The City Surveyor had Reported This but no Action was Taken by the Council The City Surveyor has addressed the following important communication to the chairman and members of the Road committee on the flooding of cellars, and also on the necessity of constructing a new intercepting sewer on Sherbrooke and St James streets. It reads as follows: Gentlemen, I beg to attach you herewith a report of Mr Brittain, recommending the construction of a new intercepting sewer on Sherbrooke street from Beaudry street to Coteau Neiges road. The construction of this sewer has become necessary by the fact that the city is receiving so many claims for flooding through the overflowing of the Coteau Harron main sewer and the intercepting sewer during very heavy exceptional rain storms. In my opinion these claims should not be entertained for the following reasons: 1. The Coteau Harron main sewer was built in 1867 in a low swampy valley, when the street was not formed and consequently no houses could have existed then. The natural conclusion is that the houses must have been built since the sewer was constructed, and therefore, the city should not be held responsible. In regard to the intercepting sewer on St Catherine street, there is only one portion of it which is at present needed during heavy rainstorms, that is between St Lawrence and St George streets. These floodings take place only when there is an exceptionally heavy rainstorm, but these floodings would not have occurred if Westmount municipality, who had the permission of the city to drain their drainage into the intercepting sewer, had abided by the plan which they submitted to the city. However, I find that the said municipality have extended their drainage system so as to take in the whole of the water from the little mountain, as it is called, above Sherbrooke street, running lateral sewers away up into the mountain, carrying the drainage from that mountain too rapidly into the city sewers, and I therefore think that it is just that the municipality of Westmount should be charged a portion of the cost of the intercepting sewer which is rendered necessary by their action. 2. In regard to the duplicate sewer in St James street, from McGill street to the western city limits, the necessity of building this sewer has been caused entirely by the action of the municipality of Lachine and the municipality of St Henri, diverting a natural water course which used to drain into the little St Pierre river into their sewers which empty into the St James street sewer. I have repeatedly notified the city of their action and have asked the city to allow me to dam the end of our sewer so as to prevent the water coming from Lachine and St Henri doing damage to the properties of the citizens of Montreal, but so far I have received no instructions to do so, and in consequence, the cellars of the properties on that street, and also on the adjoining streets, are nearly always flooded in heavy rain storms; therefore, it is necessary to build this sewer, and the cost of same should be charged to these two municipalities, and I would advise the city to notify them notarially of it. You will note by the agreement between the city and these municipalities that they rendered themselves liable for all damages which they might cause to the city. 3. In order to relieve St Catherine street, east of Amherst street, on the old Coteau Harron main sewer, we can make a temporary relief for these floodings by constructing a sewer on St Catherine street between De Lorimier avenue and Papineau road this autumn. I would also remind you that a year ago I recommended an intercepting sewer on de Levis street to drain the northeast part of the city; this report has gone before the Finance committee, but we have heard nothing further. It is necessary that this sewer should be constructed in conjunction with the other sewers, which is included in the estimate made by Mr Brittain herewith attached. In conclusion, in regard to the construction of these works recommended, I would recommend that the Sherbrooke street intercepting sewer and de Levis street sewer be let by contract, and that the St James street sewer be done by day work. The reason why I recommend that the work be done by day on St James street sewer is because the ground is swampy and the sewer will be very shallow and the work must be specially done irrespective of cost. Yours truly, (Signed) Perival W St George, City Surveyor. The estimated cost of the Sherbrooke street sewer is $149,300; St Catherine street, $411,740; St James street, $103,894; de Levis street, $139,409, and $10,000 for the extension of the main sewer now discharging into Elgin basin, making a total of $414,403. The above has been forwarded to the council and Finance committee for immediate action. The City Council The regular monthly meeting of the City council will be held on Monday evening, when, after routine business, of which there is considerable, is disposed of, the orders of the day will be taken up. The first is for the council to go into committee of the whole and consider clause by clause the early closing by-law. When this is complete the by-law will be considered. On Tuesday night there will be a special meeting of the council to take up the gas contract. An effort was made yesterday morning to get a meeting for tomorrow evening, a most unusual thing for the council to meet on Saturday, but after a conference between the City Clerk and those anxious for the meeting, it was deferred to Tuesday night. The Street Railway company owes the city $47,000 for removing the snow from the tracks last winter.

unbleached ginger firm at 14c to 14.5c, and Cochin do at 11c, Rice, in sympathy with the advance in England and the prospective advance in freight which usually takes place at this season, is very stiff here and values are hardening, $1.00 to $1.41 now being the ruling rate at this quality, In canned goods the market is firm and advancing, and we quote prices at $1.75 to $1.80 per case for herring, and at $4.00 to $4.79 per case for mackerel, sardines are steady at 25c each for quarters, The sales of brandy have not been large during the past week as those reported for the week previous, although in a jobbing way they have been fairly satisfactory, Our buyers have also met with fair enquiry, the ordinary jobbing demand for sherry, champagne, and other wines being favorable, Reports from the French vineyards concerning the vintage expected during the past month indicate that the greater part of the demand done by the cold has been met, In fact, in many districts rain would be exceedingly beneficial, In B—, it is stated that the village on the Medoc will take steps to build, out of which one is already disposed of about $10,000 worth of goods, There is no change in prices, which are likely to remain steady, It is noted that some manufacturers report a steady business, while others find orders coming in rather slowly, Those manufacturers who supply the jobbing trade are still running on full time, Prices are steady, but there is a general complaint of small profits, We quote: Men's thick boots, waxed, $2.50 to $4;

18820707,historical,rain,"THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JULY 7, 1882 WEEKLY REVIEW OF THE PRODUCE AND FUEL MARKET Montreal, July 7 There has not been much warm seasonable weather in this part of the Province, and the experience, on the whole, has been unequal, and this applies to the midsummer month so far as it has gone. Rain fell here on nine days during the first part of June, and on six days of the latter half; and only on two or three occasions has the temperature been up to a fair summer heat. July came in with heavy rain, which continued with more or less frequency until the 3rd inst, showers coming on again on the 5th and 6th. The highest temperature (74) of the past six days occurred on the 4th and 5th inst; the lowest (53) was on the 4th inst, the average daily mean being 61. Inquiries respecting the season's prospects in the Eastern Townships and part of Vermont and Maine have elicited information as follows: Country looks backward; cold weather and too much rain; hay crop on new meadows good, but light on old land; Indian corn and potatoes very backward; oats looking well; wheat considerably damaged in some sections, by wire worm. Notwithstanding very unfavorable weather in some of the Western States, crop prospects are said to be fair. Business has been interrupted this past week by holidays, Dominion Day falling on Saturday, and the United States national holiday on Tuesday. Latest advice from Europe were by Atlantic cable to date; by mail per S.S. Peruvian and Parthia, dates from London, Liverpool and Glasgow being to 24th ult.

Local shipments for the week ending 6th July, 17,801 brls. Total shipments from 1st January to 5th July, 219,600 brls, against 227,607 brls at corresponding date in 1881, being an increase of 11,933 brls. Business since the holidays has much improved, and a considerable quantity of flour has changed hands this week, some 2,000 brls being on lower ports account. Superiors have sold at $6.25, $6.22, $6.20 and $6.17; extra superior (which is specially in demand) at $6.05, $6.00 and $6.05; spring extra at $5.80, $5.90 and $5.96, and superfine at $5.25.

18980623,historical,rain,"THURSDAY, JUNE 23, Lord Herschell, who is to represent Great Britain at the Quebec conference with the United States, is a Liberal, although appointed by a Conservative Government. He was twice Lord Chancellor under Mr. Gladstone, but was not at all popular with the Radical wing of the party, owing to his refusal to accept nominations to the magisterial bench from local Liberal clubs. The magistracy in the Old Country is esteemed a great honor and is much sought after by local magnates. The Radicals wanted to use it as a political tool, and Lord Herschell persisted in following his own judgment and refusing to accept the political nominees. There was a big fight over it, and the Liberal clubs and members of the House of Commons demonstrated forcibly, but the Lord Chancellor stood his ground and carried the day. He is, therefore, a man of independent judgment, as well as of high legal acumen, and may be trusted to make a good fight for Canadian interests. His appointment by a Conservative Government is, of course, a great compliment but it is not without precedent. Sir Stafford Northcote, a Conservative, was appointed by Mr. Gladstone a member of the international commission which met at Washington in 1871. The more the Letter failure is discussed the more disastrous does it appear to be to the young Napoleon of the wheat pit. For a month he seems to have been on the verge of collapse, and it was only by a bolstering process of buying in Europe as well as in America that he averted the evil day so long. The latest Chicago calculation of his losses is as follows: On cash wheat in America $3,000,000 On futures in America $500,000 On cash wheat in Europe $2,500,000 On futures in Europe $1,000,000 Total $7,000,000 Probably saved $1,500,000 Total loss $5,500,000 Mr. Leiter's is like the case of the soldier who caught the Tartar, whereupon the Tartar ran away with him and he was lost. The list of members of the House of Commons who have thought a permanent place better than hanging on with Laurier, Tarte, Blair and Sifton and their fortunes, continues to grow. Mr. Lister is No. 7. Here is the record of less than two years: Mr. King, Sudbury and Queens, a senator; Mr. Devlin, Wright, an immigration agent; Mr. Lavergne, Drummond and Arthabaska, a judge; Mr. Fiset, Rimouski, a senator; Mr. Langelier, Quebec Centre, a judge; Mr. Cameron, West Huron, a lieutenant-governor; Mr. Lister, West Lambton, a judge. Mr. Walker, the general manager of the Bank of Commerce, in his annual address, uttered a warning against the too great use of corn in feeding hogs. One of the most prosperous industries in Canada depends for its continued success on the maintenance of the high reputation of Canadian bacon and cured hog meats, and this reputation depends a good deal on the feeding of the animals. It was built up when the feed used was largely peas; it is being endangered by the use of corn. That inestimable blessing of free corn the Laurier Government gave the country has its drawbacks and dangers. Ottawa's diocesan synod has voted to forego the right to select its own bishop as a step to its being made the metropolitan diocese of Canada and the see of one of the archbishops. The change, if it is finally made, will be in keeping with Anglican traditions, which associate the highest dignity in the Church with a special see. The system adopted in Canada, of making the senior bishop metropolitan, wherever his diocese may be, is calculated to be somewhat puzzling to those who do not understand how the federation of the dioceses in Canada was brought about. Advices from this province indicate that though there has been much rain in some places the crops have not suffered, and the promise is for a good yield of agricultural staples. The season in Quebec is rather later than in the other provinces, and the weather that has created anxiety in some parts of the West has here, so far, only helped to force on the growth. QUEBEC CROPS The Heavy Rainfall Has Not Done Any Damage Waterloo, Que, June 22 So far, crops do not seem to have suffered from too much rain. On the contrary, they seem to improve.

IN CARNIVAL AT OTTAWA Was formally opened yesterday by Sir James Grant. THE WEATHER WAS NASTY It rained nearly all the afternoon and poured all night. The Shamrocks defeated the Electrics. From our own correspondent, Ottawa, January 21. The clerk of the weather has not been kind to the Ottawa Winter carnival. A cold mixture of rain and sleet has been falling all this afternoon and evening and the streets are in such slippery condition that walking is not only difficult, but dangerous. Nevertheless, the carnival has opened with considerable éclat and indications are that it will prove a great and unqualified success. The decorations are exceedingly good and the electric display is far ahead of anything hitherto attempted in Canada, and probably excels that of any other city in this or any other continent. Sparks and Bank streets have been converted into fairyland. Thousands of colored incandescent lights are strung across the streets. Almost every building on the two thoroughfares is decorated with banners, streamers and flags are flying everywhere. The cars each carry 21 colored lights and as they flash along the streets the effect is very beautiful. The cold drizzle has had a depressing effect, but nothing short of a second deluge could dampen the ardor of people who have thronged the streets all day and are still trudging about tonight despite the icy sidewalks and the chilly wind. The formal opening of the festival took place shortly after two o'clock, when the president of the Carnival committee, accompanied by Sir Adolphe Caron, Hon. Jno. Haggart, Hon. Jno. Costigan, Hon. C. Rooms. There was not a very large attendance at any of the sports owing to the inclement weather. Rain fell all night, and walking was next to impossible. At Dey's rink the Shamrock team of Montreal covered themselves with glory by defeating the unconquered Electrics a second time. The score was 5 to 1. In the first half both teams scored once, but in the second half the Shamrocks played all round the Electrics. The teams were as follows: Shamrocks: Electrics - Mobile (goal), Hliua, Klyfe, Point, Nolan, Steven, Cover point, Murphy, McOulsten, Forwards: Murphy, Fairbairn, """"I"""" Wall, """"Baldwin, Brown, """"O'Neill.

STEEL RAILS TWO GREAT SHOW STORMS One Extends Over America and the Other Over Europe. TRAFFIC IS PARALYZED In Western Canadian Cities, and at Many Points In the United States Disasters In England. Yesterday appears to have been most remarkable as far as storms are concerned. Sunday evening's despatches brought the news that a very severe blizzard was prevailing in Kansas. This storm has since spread all over the Western states, going as far south as St. Louis, where the phenomenal fall for that latitude of four inches of snow was recorded. Chicago's winds never blew before as they did yesterday and from all points in the Western states come the same reports of unprecedented snowfalls and heavy winds. In Canada the storm, or another, appeared at an early hour yesterday morning, and by six o'clock the electric car services in all the important points west of Toronto had been completely paralyzed. This continent was not alone. The cable reports extraordinarily high winds as prevailing in Great Britain, attended by many shipwrecks, while reports of the same nature come from Europe as far distant as Austria, showing that the European storm was almost as widespread as the American. IN CANADA, Yesterday's Storm Paralysed all the Western Ontario Towns. TORONTO, February 12. The snow storm here was one of the worst recollected by the average citizen. The streetcar service was badly blocked early in the afternoon and electricity gave way to horse power in the outlying lines. Unchanged street electric cars were kept running with difficulty all day. Drifts were formed in many streets to the depth of several feet. Trains coming into the city were very late. Meetings announced for the evening were in every case very thinly attended, and the streets were empty tonight. No damage in the city is reported from the storm at present. ST. CATHARINES, February 12. A terrific wind and snowstorm has prevailed here most of the day and is still raging. The electric street railway car line is knocked out and traffic generally demoralized. LONDON, LONDON, Ont, February 12. The storm today was the severest that has visited this city this winter and was made up of wind, sleet and snow; it completely paralyzed business. The wind reached its greatest velocity about noon and prevailed with undiminished strength for the remainder of the day. Comparatively little snow fell, but what there was was blown into drifts about the sidewalks and pavements. On the eastbound railroads trains were running a little behind time owing to the storm. NIAGARA FALLS, Niagara Falls, Ont, February 12. The worst snowstorm of years struck town this morning. A regular northeast gale blew the snow in all directions. Towards evening the gale reached a terrific force, piling the snow up in piles eight to ten feet deep, completely suspending traffic on the streets. The horse cars to Drummondville shut down for the night early in the afternoon. The electric lines on both sides of the river, after fighting the storm, gave up in despair. The railways are having their hands full trying to keep their lines open for passenger traffic only; passenger trains on all the lines are running from three to five hours late, freight traffic being abandoned. HAMILTON, Hamilton, February 12. A genuine blizzard struck here today. A snowstorm, accompanied by a very strong northeast wind, has been raging nearly all day. The electric service is entirely suspended and street traffic generally is much impeded. Trains east and west are pretty well on time and from the north and south the service has been kept up fairly well so far. WINDSOR, WINDSOR, Ont, February 12. The Windsor, Sandwich and Walkerville street railway lines were tied up by the storm about 10:30 this morning, and the cars stand in the street where they were deserted by their crews. Traffic and business of all kinds is almost entirely suspended. The ferry boats are almost deserted and it is almost impossible to make a landing on the other side. The water in Detroit River is rapidly backing from the lakes below and has risen nearly three feet since yesterday, the current being at a perfect standstill. It is almost an impossibility to run the car ferries, and trains on all roads entering Windsor are several hours behind time. THE AMERICAN END. It Began In Kansas and Ended In the Atlantic. CHICAGO, February 12. The worst blizzard that ever struck this city, so far as the weather bureau records show for twenty-three years, is raging here. Street traffic is greatly impeded and walking is accompanied with great danger to life and limb. Many persons have already been injured by being blown to the ground, against walls and street posts by the wind. The velocity is eighty miles an hour, the highest ever recorded for this city and almost double the velocity of the wind which is blowing a blizzard in the Western states. The wind was so furious at the corners where skyscrapers are built, especially the Monadnock annex block, bounded by Jackson, Van Buren and Dearborn streets and Custom House place, that extra policemen gave all their attention to the pedestrians. Dozens of women were lifted off their feet and blown to the ground, or else pushed across the streets until they came in violent contact with walls, posts and other obstacles. Mrs. Brahany, of No. 361 South Clinton street, a charwoman at the Art Institute, was lifted in the air and dashed against the fireplug of the Dearborn and Van Buren street corner. Two of her ribs were broken, and it is believed she is internally injured. She lay in the snow drift until men rushed to her rescue, and the police ambulance took her home. The gusts of wind and blinding particles of snow frightened men as well as women from attempting to cross Dearborn street at Van Buren. The effect of others kept them within sheltering doorways. Civilians and policemen became a volunteer brigade, and on the principle that in union there is strength, they locked arms with the belated police workers and crossed in safety. At the stockyards there was a practical suspension of business all the morning. No buyers were to be seen. Stock trains were late, and when they did arrive were covered with snow. In the suburbs the storm was felt with rather more severity than in the heart of the city. One of the big front windows of the Leland hotel was blown in early this morning at the very beginning of the storm. The glass was blown clear across one of the parlors by the force of the wind, but the window was boarded up before any serious damage was done by the snow. The drifted snow and the high wind played havoc with the mail. Nearly all the mail trains were late, and from some of them no tidings were received until late in the day. All the roads suffered, both the eastern and western trains being from one to eight hours late. The driving snow made signals on the railroad tracks practically useless, and caused a collision between two freight trains on the West Shore tracks near 97th street and Stoney avenue about noon. Luther J. Webster, fireman on the second train, had his foot crushed. More accidents were reported to the police today resulting from the high wind. In spite of the fearful weather and the condition of the streets the ambulances were kept busy a large part of the day. BLOOMINGTON, Ill., February 12. A violent snowstorm raged throughout central Illinois all today. The snow is ten inches on a level, and is badly drifted. Many trains are delayed, and one passenger train on the Big Four is stuck in a drift near Tremont. There are drifts here five feet deep. INDIANA, FORT WAYNE, February 12. The great blizzard reached this city at four o'clock this morning and is still raging. All streetcar traffic was abandoned at an early hour. Every railroad centering here is blocked and traffic is practically suspended on all lines. WABASH, February 12. The heaviest snowstorm of the season raged here yesterday and today. The wind blew sixty miles an hour. The thermometer was below zero and the suffering among the poorly clad and half-housed people on the big prairie north of here is fearful. NEW YORK, SARANAC LAKE, February 12. The worst storm of the season is now raging here. The thermometer has dropped 42 degrees in four hours and now registers eight below zero. Snow is falling and aided by a terrific west wind is drifting badly. NEW YORK, February 12. The city tonight is covered with a mantle of snow several inches thick. Travel of all kinds is greatly impeded. The storm is the most severe one of the season and is expected to last until tomorrow night or Wednesday morning. The thermometer is down to 20 degrees, and the wind is blowing from the northeast at the rate of thirty miles an hour. Railroad traffic is almost demoralized. All trains are behind time, and the mails from the south and west are greatly delayed. The ferry houses are blocked with belated passengers waiting for the overdue ferry boats, which are compelled to run at a considerably reduced rate of speed. The elevated railroad trains are delayed. The effect of the snow is felt on the outskirts of the city, and the markets are stagnated by the lack of farm produce, the roads being almost impassable on account of deep snow drifts. Sergeant Dunn, of the weather bureau, said tonight that this storm was but the advance guard of one more severe, which would be followed by a very cold wave. Danger signals have been ordered up all along the coast and vessels have been warned not to leave port. At the rate the snow is falling tonight it will be a foot deep by the morning. Reports from all points throughout the state indicate that the storm is general and very severe and that traffic is greatly impeded; trains are badly delayed everywhere. Despatches from New Jersey report a similar state of affairs. The storm along the New Jersey and Long Island coast is particularly severe. A high northeast gale prevails, and the air is thick with flying snow. Mariners off the coast will have a hard night of it. It is probable that several wrecks will be reported tomorrow. The life-saving crews have doubled their patrols and are on the alert so as to promptly answer signals of distress. One wreck was reported tonight. It occurred on Rockaway Beach, opposite the Arverne hotel. The Arverne life-saving crew cannot go to the relief of the vessel on account of the blinding snowstorm and the high and heavy sea which prevails. The vessel is stranded some distance off shore, and her size or the crew she carries cannot be ascertained. The fate of the crew is in doubt, but their position is an extremely dangerous one. NEBRASKA, OMAHA, Neb., February 12. Nebraska is snowbound. For the past twenty-four hours a terrific blizzard has prevailed throughout the state. The fall has been about twelve inches and, following the eight-inch fall of snow on Thursday, makes the depth at least twenty inches. The cold is extremely severe with few exceptions. Omaha traffic of every description is suspended. Trains in every direction last night were abandoned. The mail trains are being got through with difficulty. The high wind has been piling the snow in great drifts. Reports from the interior show stock is in good condition and farmers are pleased with the immense snowfalls, as it assures a fine winter wheat crop. OHIO, CLEVELAND, February 12. A severe wind and snowstorm from the northwest struck this city this morning. Nearly all trains are late. Streetcar traffic is almost entirely suspended. FREMONT, O., February 12. In a blinding snowstorm, which had been raging all morning, freight train No. 40, westbound, and eastbound light freight No. 25, on the Wheeling and Lake Erie railroad, collided two miles west of Bellevue about 10:30 o'clock. Both engines and several freight cars were smashed and piled up in confusion. Engineer Connell, of light freight No. 25; Fireman McMullen, of engine No. 25; Brakeman Johnson, of freight engine No. 28; and Engineer Samuel Stowell, of engine No. 28, were killed. MISSOURI, ST. LOUIS, Mo., February 12. Without warning from the weather bureau a veritable Kansas blizzard struck this city at 11 o'clock last night and continued up to 6 o'clock tonight. Rain, hail, sleet and snow alternately swept over the city before a high wind. At daylight the street railways had abandoned efforts to run cars till the tracks were cleared by snow plows. All the railway trains that were not abandoned entirely were late, the Alton express from Chicago being eight hours behind time. The snow is four inches deep, which is phenomenal for this latitude, as time passed the storm increased in severity and at 2 p.m. the wind had risen to a 30-mile gait, with the thermometer 8 degrees above zero and falling. The casualties are numerous, but none serious. The overhead wires look like masses of white ropes and many have been snapped by the weight of ice. Two horses were shocked to death by coming in contact with a broken live wire. Telegrams from all points from the South and West show that the storm is widespread and disastrous. MISSISSIPPI, NEW ORLEANS, February 12. Advices received here today and tonight indicate that a storm approaching in violence a cyclone is raging in Mississippi, and that the town of Newton has been wiped out of existence, but as the telegraph wires are all down full particulars cannot be obtained. MEMPHIS, Tenn., February 12. A special from Jackson, Miss., says: A terrible cyclone passed between Martinsville and Beauregard, 40 miles south of here, at a late hour at night within a few miles of a patch of the terrible cyclone of April, 1884. The cyclone was about a mile wide and everything in its path was leveled. A great many houses were swept from their foundations, trees twisted off, fences destroyed, several people killed and a great many seriously injured. KANSAS, KANSAS CITY, February 12. The worst snowstorm in years raged all over Kansas and Missouri last night and today, for not a single train was on time. The snow averaged from one foot to two feet on the level. High winds accompanied it, and at some points it is 20 feet deep. In many sections schools were closed today. In towns with street railways the service was paralyzed. The snow was dry and the telegraph service was not injured. TOPEKA, Kan., February 12. All railroads in Kansas are blockaded with snow and scarcely a wheel is turning in the state. VESSELS ASHORE, LONG BRANCH, COLD WEATHER. That Is What the Probs Say of Today's Weather. Meteorological Office, Toronto, Ont, February 12, 11 p.m. The storm which was developing in the Lower Mississippi valley last night has divided into two parts, one moving to the lake region and the other to the middle Atlantic coast.

February 12. The old Government House conservatory, which cost the province $3,000, collapsed last night under the weight of snow. Since the Government house has been closed up by Attorney-General Blair the premises have rapidly decayed. James H. McLeod, a well-to-do farmer of Johnston, Queen's county, perished in Saturday night's storm. His horse got home and after daybreak McLeod's body was found about one mile away on the road. A wife and family survive him. Paxton Baird's dwelling and barn on St. John street, Woodstock, were burned this morning. The house and furniture were insured for $1,500. Carroll Ryan will open a branch of the Murphy Gold Cure in St. John on the 20th instant. All the St. John newspapers today made kindly editorial mention of the late John Livingston. Mayor Peters has aroused the ire of the temperance folks by stating that he will pay no attention to petitions against granting liquor licenses so long as the applicants for license secure the legal number of ratepayers to the applications. The Church of England institute holds daily half-hour noon-day religious services for men in Orange hall during Lent. Today's service, conducted by Archdeacon Brigstocke, was largely attended by business and professional men. Resuscitation Method. Yesterday afternoon the Fire hall in No. 1 Fire station was crowded with firemen who could be spared from their duty, to hear and see an illustrated lecture by Professor Killick, of the Turkish Baths, on life saving, new ladder work, and how to resuscitate quickly firemen and others overcome by smoke. Among those present were Chief Benoit, some of the tub-chiefs, Alderman Stevenson and Dr. de Cotret, the physician of the brigade. Dr. de Cotret, at the lecturer's invitation, will study the system, which is the invention of Dr. Howard, of London. In the center of the hall a ladder was erected, which ran up to the ceiling, to which a double whip, or rather endless rope with a single block pulley was attached, with the tail end tied to the upper rung of the ladder. He demonstrated that it was possible to rescue individuals from four floors by swinging themselves into belts attached to the endless rope, the life belts being so distanced when being drawn up that they corresponded with the windows. The last part of the lecture was taken up by showing how to resuscitate anyone overcome by smoke. KILLED BY A SAW. ROSSEAU, Ont., February 12. Mr. John Richardson, of Windermere, was engaged in shoveling snow off some saw logs this morning when one of them accidentally started to roll, striking him on the head and crushing it in a frightful manner, instantly killing him. He was picked up immediately afterwards by his companions but nothing could be done for him. His remains were brought to Rosseau and Dr. Waddy, having examined him, notified Coroner Bely of the accident and he considered an inquest unnecessary as no blame could be attached to anyone in any way whatever. A Doctor Injured. BRANTFORD, Ont., February 12. Dr. Davidson, of Cainsville, was this morning driving with a team and carriage and when crossing the Grand Trunk railway track about four miles north of Brantford, was run into by the morning train from Brantford to Harrisburg, the buggy smashed to pieces, one of the horses instantly killed and the doctor seriously injured. The train stopped and the doctor was brought to the Brantford hospital. As far as can be learned his injuries are an arm badly broken, a leg broken and a bad cut on the head. NOVA SCOTIA LEGISLATURE PROROGUED, Halifax, February 12. The local Legislature was closed today by the customary speech, one clause of which was as follows: This being the fourth session of the present General Assembly, it will probably be unnecessary to again summon you to the performance of your legislative duties. The Assembly will be dissolved at an early day, and the usual steps will be taken to enable the electors of the province to choose representatives to serve for another term. There were 110 bills passed by the Legislature this session. WANTED $1,000 for the Job. HALIFAX, February 12. A propeller and shaft for the disabled steamer Forsttholme will probably be obtained from England. The salvage said to be claimed by the Priam, which towed the Forsttholme to port, is placed at $25,000. MR. SARAH Muir, of Minneapolis. For Women Hood's Sarsaparilla Is Especially Adapted to Cure Difficulties Peculiar to the Sex - the restoring and invigorating properties of Hood's Sarsaparilla, combined with its power to vitalize and enrich the blood, render it peculiarly adapted for all troubles peculiar to women that tired feeling, or debility caused by change of season, climate or life. Hood's Sarsaparilla has accomplished very gratifying results in many cases, read the following: I was for a long time a sufferer from Female Weakness and tried many remedies and physicians, to no good purpose. One day I read one of the Hood's Sarsaparilla books, and thought I would try a bottle of the medicine. It made so great a difference in my condition that I took three bottles more and found myself perfectly well. I have also given Hood's Sarsaparilla to the children, and find that it keeps them in good health. I am willing that this shall be used for the benefit of others. MRS.

Snowshoers At Work. A Friendly Doubles Match. Luetqne Wins the Pool Match. General. The success of the championship races in Montreal has given an impetus to skate racing here that was to a certain extent unlooked for. After the first attempts at the Amateur championships great possibilities seemed to be on hand, and then the professionals came along. The Montreal Snowshoe club added to the attraction of their races by offering a purse for the professionals and medals for the amateurs. This arrangement was so enticing that such a shrewd man as T. W. Fairman Keeree, Geo. H. Baird, The Holly Veteran's Night. The Holly Snowshoe club hold their annual veterans' tramp this evening, starting from their club room at eight o'clock sharp. It is to be hoped there will be a large turnout of the old timers as well as the new members. A special programme has been prepared for the occasion; the lady friends of the members are cordially invited. Their annual """"at home"""" takes place a week from tonight, the 20th instant. Blasi's orchestra will furnish the music. Tickets, of which there are a limited number, are nearly all sold. The president, Mr. Thomas Reid, has the deepest sympathy of the officers and members of the club in his recent bereavement in the loss of one of his family by death. They Had a Good Tramp. Forty-five members of the Emerald Snowshoe club discovered their way to the Club house last night. A most enjoyable evening was spent in music, dancing, etc., among those contributing being G. Parks, T. Malone, Mitchell, J. Flynn, X. Mathews, A. Faean, Galloway, Cawthorn, J. Bennett, J. McLean. The regular football match was played between old and new members and won by the latter. Emerald Green Steeplechase. The green steeplechase of the Emerald Snowshoe club was held last night, the objective point being Lumkins' hotel. When the finishing point was crossed the following was the summary: T. Mathews 22, V. Buchanan and W. S. Weldon. Only a limited number of tickets will be sold, and to get them at all it is necessary to get them early. The programme to be rendered between the acts is a very well arranged one, and will certainly be enjoyed by the audience. FROM THE ANCIENT CAPITAL. LEON CARRIER is Committed for Trial. Personal Gossip. From our own correspondent. QUEBEC, February 12. The investigation into the case of Leon Carrier, the defaulting flour commission agent, was concluded this morning. The prisoner was committed to stand his trial at the next term of the Court of Queen's Bench on eleven charges. After commitment he declared that he was much worried with the affair and anxious to see the end of it as soon as possible, no matter how it came out. A difficulty has arisen in connection with the ice bridge leading to the Island of Orleans. Mr. Trudel, the contractor for building and maintaining the road, complained that the ice cutters had made the road impassable and opened a more convenient one a short distance away. Mr. Kancourt, an ice dealer, who takes his supply near that place, contends that Mr. Trudel has no right to open a new road and has lodged a protest to stop this further construction. The city health officer reports four cases of diphtheria, two of typhoid fever, six of scarlet fever and one of measles existing in the city at present. The Intercolonial railway train due at Levis at noon yesterday only got in at 8 o'clock last night. It was derailed three times by ice which covered the line on some of the curves. There was no damage. During Saturday night unknown thieves stole the flags, furniture and fixings of the handsome allegorical car of the Levis Snowshoe club. The car was stored in a shed belonging to one of the members of the club. An unfortunate Jewish peddler was overcome by the storm on Saturday and sank fainting to the ground near Dorchester bridge, unable to reach the nearest house. She was seen and rescued by the people of the house. Lieutenant-Governor Chapleau and Don, Mr. Royal, ex-lieutenant-governor of the Northwest territories, attended High Mass at the Basilica yesterday morning. Hon. P. Garneau has gone to New York in connection with the Quebec Steamship company, of which he is president. Mr. John H. Holt, of the Renfrew fur establishment, left today for Europe with Mrs. Holt.

18980207,historical,snow,"JANUARY WEATHER Some Official Facts and Figures on Temperature and Cold Waves The meteorological weather map for January says: The temperature conditions over the Dominion were, on the whole, decidedly abnormal, as in the Northwest Territories the mean for the month was from 11 degrees to 16 degrees above average, the greatest excess being in Alberta, while in the province of New Brunswick the mean was from 4 degrees to 7 degrees below the average. The change between the unusual mildness of Alberta and the abnormal cold of New Brunswick was gradual from west to east, and the Ottawa and Upper St. Lawrence Valleys, and also Vancouver Island, were the only parts of the Dominion where the mean temperature was just equal to the average. Referring to this province, the report says: The principal cold spells of the month occurred during the first five and last five days. The rest of the month, between the 6th and the 26th, was on the whole moderately cold, but the temperature seldom fell as low as zero; during this period, however, much snow fell, and two particularly heavy storms occurred. The first of these was on the night of the 20th, when nearly a foot of snow fell in Montreal, and in Quebec, where the snowfall was not so heavy, the wind reached an hourly velocity of 66 miles from the north. The other severe storm occurred three days later, on the 23rd, when another foot of snow fell in Montreal, and in Quebec five inches fell, with a northeast gale reaching 68 miles an hour. In Quebec the temperature fell below zero on 13 days, and did not rise above zero on 8 days; during the last few days the weather was very cold, and an ice bridge formed on the river in front of the city. FRACTURED HIS THIGH A sad accident overtook little George F. Stafford on Saturday afternoon, when he was enjoying that fun, dear to the hearts of all boys, jumping into the snow from the shed roofs. The little fellow, who resides with his people at No. 2065 St. Hubert street, was playing on a neighbor's roof. In jumping into the snow below he fractured his thigh, and it was found necessary to remove him to the Royal Victoria Hospital in the ambulance. TOLD IN A PARAGRAPH Passengers on the Toronto train arriving at Windsor street at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday reported that they had travelled through a continuous snowstorm all the way from Toronto. The meeting of the Gleaners' Union announced for the afternoon of Monday, February 7, will not take place, in consequence of sudden illness, at the house where it was to have been held. TRADE IN CANADA Reports From Different Cities Toronto February 6 Bradstreet's weekly trade summary says: Victoria and Vancouver The gold excitement continues to increase. Steamers are now leaving here almost daily, with passengers and freight accommodation taxed to their utmost in many cases freight space being booked several days ahead. One order, amounting to nearly two hundred thousand dollars, was recently secured by merchants here, from an Alaska company for shipment in May, and most dealers report January sales over 10 per cent higher than the corresponding month last year. Trade in the Interior remains quiet, with collections slow. Winnipeg Wheat has taken a drop and the grain market in general is flat. There has been quite a demand for shipments of felt shoes, moccasins, snowshoes, etc., but solely for the Yukon trade. Underwriting has been an unusual feature for this season, but the possibilities of it being taken from the free-list is doubtful. The manufacturing in hardware, paints, etc., is improving slightly, but no important change in prices is noticeable. Owing to the mild winter the country produce trade has been the largest on record. Grocery prices remain firm. The most disastrous fire in the business history of the city occurred on the morning of the second, involving the total destruction of the McIntyre block and two other buildings, with twelve large retail stores, the bulk of the travellers' sample rooms, and some of the principal law offices. The staggering loss, it is estimated, will reach four hundred thousand dollars, with an insurance of probably two hundred thousand. Halifax There is no improvement to report in trade circles, and the volume of business for the week has been light. Collections only fair. A heavy snowstorm blocking trains and delaying traffic was much felt all over the Maritime Provinces. St. John, New Brunswick, reports business for the past week rather quiet. The lumber trade in St. John is perhaps never in a more depressed state than it has been for some little time, partly owing to the large quantity of snow that has fallen lately in different parts of New Brunswick. A number of lumber contractors were compelled to leave their operations. The output of logs this winter is not expected to exceed 60 per cent of that of last year. Toronto Heavy snowstorms and extremely cold weather throughout the province have interfered with business this week. The weather conditions have been against any extension of trade, and the shipment of goods to retailers. But the conditions of trade may be said to have greatly improved. There are now good winter roads in all sections, and the prospects for large deliveries of grain, and a brisk demand at country points for staple goods, are better than at any time since the winter set in. Yesterday was the most important day of the year for payments on dry goods paper; it was attended with quite a few failures, but on the whole the paper was generally well met, and when the customers at a distance are heard from within the next few days, it is expected the results will be quite up to expectations. There were some requests for extensions, but the percentage of renewals was not as large as last year. The fourth of February in the dry-goods trade is regarded as a crucial test for country traders. The wholesalers are not anxious to ship goods for the coming season till it is found how payments are met, and now that the date has been passed, rather more satisfactorily than expected, trade will become more active in many lines. Wools are in good demand and firmer. Hides are firm. Leathers are moving out well and at good prices, and tanners say they have sufficient orders to keep them busy for two months. A better inquiry is experienced from Klondike parties for outfits both in the way of provisions and clothing, it being found that supplies can be bought cheaper here than in the west, and as these orders are for cash the result is that such business is bringing about the circulation of a good deal of money. Canadian woolen mills are busy on orders for goods suitable for the mining camps. The money market here is unchanged. Montreal Extra severe weather and a general blocking of country roads by snow has lowered the record for business. During the earlier part of the week, travellers were snow-bound, in the majority of instances, when off lines of railway. Remittances were sensibly decreased, and orders scarce. Towards the close conditions became nearly normal, and obligations maturing on the fourth were met better than last year, but, as usual, too many renewals were asked for. The failure list has also kept up the averages, but there were no very serious ones in this province. A steady business continues in paints, oils and glass, and retailers seem satisfied to pay an advance on last year's prices. Hardware fairly active, with a good general distribution, and in this trade the losses by bad debts continue light. Grocery firms are just now taking stock; some have inventories completed, and the general results show an improvement over the preceding year. In this trade short credits and a quick turnover, even with comparatively small profits, show that there is money in the business. Flour dealers report business quiet, the demand being largely local. Canned goods are also moving slowly, but at firm quotations. Railway earnings show handsome increases, with a likelihood of an early termination of the cutting of rates. The trade of Montreal city keeps up satisfactorily, and has not suffered to any great extent by snowstorms, the Street Railway having successfully overcome any opposition there may be from that source; in fact, the service is considered one of the best on the continent. The stock market has shown up well for the week, but there seem to be few spots that can safely be engineered to much higher figures. Quebec A slight improvement is noticed in general business during the past week over that of the preceding one. Wholesale dry goods and grocers report orders coming in better, but collections are not quite up to the mark. Local flour dealers report a better demand, and prices have advanced 10 cents to 15 cents per barrel. Shoe manufacturers appear to be busy. Hides are reported scarce and in active demand. THE FORTIFIED CITY Speaking of Quebec, the paper says: The fortifications are on the old Vauban bastioned system, adapted, of course, to the configuration of the ground, with steep escarps, counter-scarps, and deep ditches, with ravelins at intervals. The """"old lines,"""" or ordinary ramparts of the city, followed the windings of the ground, and encircled most of the city, having five ancient gates. In its good old times there used to be an officer's guard at each during the night, but in the peaceful days of 1870-71 the officer's guard was confined to the Citadel, and sergeants' guards were de rigueur elsewhere. However, there were plenty of guards and sentries, which were carefully visited day and night, by the officers and held officer on garrison duty. As the numbers of field officers were small, I had, when a captain, the honor of being on the field officers' roster for that duty, and as horses could not often traverse the snow-clad city in winter, we had to drive, with the orderly sergeant, in sleighs. The opposite shore at Point Levis, being within easy cannon range of Quebec, had its commanding ridges of country occupied by three bomb-proof casemates, pentagonal, and solidly-constructed forts, mainly on the German system of fortification. There was bomb-proof accommodation for the troops who lived in them, and the ditches, wide and deep, were flanked with saponiers. These three forts, one of which I superintended, as to its construction, occupy the high ridge of the land between the picturesque village of Point Levis and the Grand Trunk Railway depot. The pleasant summers of 1870 and 1871 were enlivened with practical joking of a unique, if a ridiculous, character. The exhilarating nature of the Canadian air possibly assisted matters, but the secrets were well kept, and the perpetrators never discovered. To such an extent was practical joking carried as regards dinner parties and dances, that it became almost necessary, in a delicate, round-about manner, to make private inquiries, after receiving an invitation, whether it was genuine or not. A TOBOGGAN INCIDENT Col. Mitchell refers to tobogganing, a sport now almost dead. At the Citadel ground a portion of the fence had been taken away, through which the toboggan could skim to the flat level ground. I am afraid that fence was responsible for a good many disasters to amateurs, who, instead of steering their toboggan through the gap, occasionally steered it into the fence. A broken leg, a broken jaw, contusions, and various minor accidents made up a good list of casualties at the end of the season. One casualty I disinter from the """"waters of Lethe."""" A widow, fair and fat, and said to be forty, was tempted by a Control Officer to try this novel motion. She was carefully packed up into the toboggan at the top of the hill, and the Control officer sat behind. They started and arrived safely as far as the fence. For some reason the widow availed herself of the opportunity to scream, and so disconcerted the nerves of the control officer that he steered badly, and he and the widow were shot out. In less time than I take to narrate the tale, the widow went head first into a heap of snow, the only thing visible being a pair of black boots. But she speedily emerged, collided with the control officer, and they playfully rolled one over the other, as some funny gentleman suggested like the """"Control cats,"""" to the bottom of the hill, where the toboggan had arrived before them. I am afraid that they received little pity, for the upset was unanimously voted to be the best toboggan incident of the season, and the story in various forms long rivalled the tale of the immortal pussy-cats. Finally, the control officer, to the sound of marriage-bells, led the widow up the nave of the local church to the altar. A TRIBUTE TO DR. SOME REFLECTIONS Quebec stands out in the world's history as a locality in which causes produced the most rapid effects, and in which in each case the effects were exactly opposite to what shortsighted mortals anticipated. In 1758 the French, in possession of certain provinces, attempted to wrest from England others. After a war, perhaps unequalled for cruelty and atrocity, both parties employing savages, who alternately tortured and burnt to death their prisoners, France lost all, and in 1760 had to surrender its own provinces to Great Britain. England's prosperity made the nation arrogant. She believed the colonies could not resist her imperious will, and imagined, as the French were chased out of Canada, America was all her own. So long as the French were there the American colonists had an enemy on the frontiers, and looked to England for support and protection. The American colonists gained their independence, which they probably would not have done had not France, irritated by the loss of Canada, aided them by sea and land. But the French King and his advisers forgot that each attempt by either party to crush the other resulted in the celebrated dictum of the Athenian Menelaus, who warned his countrymen against making rods for their own backs, a practice said to be by no means unknown in a certain branch of a State department high up in Pall Mall. France upheld American principles; the French people, their armies and navies, became imbued with the principles of equality, that seeds of revolution were sown, and resulted in mob law; and the King and Queen and many nobles ended their lives on the scaffold. STATE OF TRADE Stormy Weather Checked the Distribution of Goods New York February 4 Bradstreet's tomorrow will say: Severely cold weather, accompanied by high winds and heavy snow, has been a feature exercising considerable influence upon the movement and distribution of staple goods. The Northern and Eastern States appear to have felt the effects of the storm most severely and reports of checked distribution come from many points in New England, the middle States, and the Lake region. Some improvement in the retail demand for winter goods is, however, reported as a result thereof. In spite of this interruption a satisfactory trade for the season is reported in most lines, with special activity reported in the iron and steel trades and kindred lines. In the East, the distribution of dry goods and wool has been checked and the movement of produce greatly interfered with, but the tone of the cotton goods situation is, if anything, improved. The middle States and in the Central West the movement of iron into consumption is very large but nervousness as to possible overproduction anticipates the market. Steel is slightly lower at the East, but firmly held in Chicago, which also reports advances in iron bars, wires and nails. Western mills will not agree to deliver steel rails, billets or rods on new orders before July 1. Steadiness in prices has been a feature of the week, the only decreases noted being in wheat, corn and flour, on a speculative reaction, and in lead, while the prices of oats, pork, beef and coffee are higher. Print cloths show a further advance and the cold weather has affected anthracite coal production, with a consequent advance of 10 cents per ton. Business failures, though slightly larger than last week, numbering 293 against 188 the week before, are a little above the normal. They compare with the total number falling in the corresponding week of 1897, of 65, in 1898 of 31, in 1899 of 293; and in 1894 of 330. The total number falling in the first week of February, 1893, was 128. Bank clearings, totals at 17 cities, as telegraphed to Bradstreet's, with comparisons, show total clearances of 11,470,800,821, an increase of 40.6 per cent, as compared with the corresponding week of last year. The clearances outside of New York city were 1,508,570,620, an increase of 14.7 per cent. They Are Against Zola Here is a letter, addressed to Zola, signed by ten mayors and two councillors of the Department of Aisne, and published in the Nouvelle de L'Aisne: You have insulted us by sending us your sickly lucubrations. We indignantly protest against your abominable work, which aims at the destruction of the respect which we owe to the army and to the nation. Sir, you are laboring in the interest of the Traitor. You are not a Frenchman. In that feigned emotion which is attached to hypocritical mercy, you dare to ask France to outrage the commanders of her army. Be assured that your appeal has produced profound disgust and that it is covered with an contempt which it merits. It is by the cry of """"Vive l'armée!"""" that we respond to your infamy. Accept, Monsieur, the assurances of our most profound contempt. IF YOU WISH TO BE WELL You must fortify your system against the attacks of disease. Your blood must be kept pure, your stomach and digestive organs in order, your appetite good; Hood's Sarsaparilla is the medicine to build you up, purify and enrich your blood and give you strength. It creates an appetite and gives digestive power. HOOD'S PILLS are the favorite family cathartic, easy to take, easy to operate.

FLAMES SPREAD QUICKLY Were Hardly Noticed Before the Entire Building was on Fire Just how the fire did start is a question which nobody seemed to have any clear conception of. The men working in the building, about three in number, attributed its origin to something going wrong with the transformers. The firemen said that they had hardly time to realize that fire had broken out before the men were obliged to relinquish their post, owing to the quickness with which the flames spread over the woodwork of the building. They scarcely had time to realize that the building was on fire before the whole structure was ablaze. This is probably to be accounted for by the quantity of oil which, in every place where similar machinery is used, soaks into the floors, and gets spattered over the walls, causing them to be excessively inflammable. It was about 7:45 o'clock when the fire broke out, and although the Cote St. Paul fire brigade was quickly on the scene, the flames so quickly assumed threatening proportions that no hope of saving the building was entertained for the first. Still, the men set themselves at once to their task, and two teams were diverted from the hydrant at the corner of Notre Dame street, (just at the terminus of the Street Railway) and Cote St. Paul road, and directed onto the burning structure. Just in the rear of the power house, and directly adjoining it, there is a small wooden building, the property of the Dominion Government, used by the lockmaster as a dwelling-house, and the firemen directed their labors at once to save this property, which they succeeded in doing. There was also a collection of buildings, about fifty yards away, opposite the power house, the safety of which the work of the firemen, no doubt, ensured. Owing to the fact that there was but little wind blowing at the time, there were but few sparks emitted from the blaze, and what did rise fell into the snow-covered vacant lots surrounding the property, and did not threaten any of the other buildings in the vicinity. The St. Henri fire brigade also sent a detachment of men with a couple of reels, to be present in case of emergency, and also to assist in beating down the flames in the burning building, and an engine was afterward sent from the city. These firefighting facilities, however, were practically of no use so far as saving property was concerned, for, as already stated, the flames had pretty well marked out their work of destruction even before any of the firemen arrived. Nobody unfamiliar with the valuable nature of an electrical plant and apparatus would have had any idea of the extent of the damage done last night, by a mere sight of the fire. The power house, although a valuable structure in itself, seemed a comparatively small building, as seen amid its fiery envelopment. The building, a solid structure with an iron roof, was erected in 1901 for the Citizens' Light & Power Company. It was not so much by the building itself, however, that the loss was to be estimated, as in the valuable plant and equipment which was destroyed with it. Among the machinery with which the power house was fitted, there were 5 arc light machines, 2 two thousand light incandescent, 1 one thousand light incandescent, and 1 seven hundred and fifty light incandescent light machines. There were also 2 synchronous motors, 4 exciters, 3 engines, 11 boilers, switch-boards, shafting, belting, wiring, lamps, etc., together with other expensive items of equipment. 75 25 II tW Overcast 80 t)!W 80 91 Snow a imz ai 1 ill!

McMULLEN Offered the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Northwest Territories No Black Diphtheria Minor and Personal Ottawa, January The drawing-room held in the Senate chamber last evening by their Excellencies the Governor-General and the Countess of Aberdeen, was the most brilliant function which has graced the halls of Parliament since the memorable historical ball of two years ago, and was the most numerously attended drawing-room held for many years. The reception proper lasted exactly one hour and thirty-five minutes, and during that time 378 ladies and 359 gentlemen made their curtsey and bows to their Excellencies. All of the Cabinet ministers were present in uniform, and there was a large number of members of Parliament present. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir Richard Cartwright and Sir Oliver Mowat wore the baldric and cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. There was a brave show of smart gowns by the ladies, and ostrich feathers and veils were almost universal. Your correspondent, who is of a statistical turn of mind, being only able to discover 23 ladies, mostly young girls, who were not thus adorned. The graceful plume and snowy shimmering veils mingled pleasantly with the many-colored hues of the headquarters' staff uniforms, and the brilliant costumes of the ballet knights, and by the time the floor had become filled, there was to be seen one of the most gorgeous aggregations of youth, beauty, fashion, and harmoniously-blended color which has assembled in the Senate chamber for many a long day. The preparations were over shortly after half-past ten, but for an hour longer receptions were held by Madame Pelletier in the chambers of the Speaker of the Senate and by Mrs. Edgar, and her charming daughter, in the chamber of the Speaker of the House of Commons; both of which were attended by His Excellency and the Countess of Aberdeen, and at each of which light refreshments were served. Amongst the ladies present from Montreal were Madame Horace Archambault, Mrs. Jeffrey Burland, Mrs. A VETERANS' NIGHT The Red Cross Knights Spend a Pleasant Evening A SPLENDID FARE-FOR-ALL Victoria Defeat the Ottawa at Hockey Other Matches Bowlor Busy at Quebec General Sporting Sing a song of snowshoe, A sleigh and two score men All fell into a snow bank, And then fell out again. This is not poetry, as Ben Jonson would say, but it is true; so true that if anybody cares to take the trouble he may go up in the neighborhood of Churchill avenue and count out the snow mask of twenty-four Red Cross knights and some American visitors who had done honor to the veterans, and who, on their way home, were incontinently dumped into about ten feet of the nicest, whitest and coldest snow that is produced in this neighborhood. A moment before the party was as full of warmth as furs, a good dinner and congenial company could generate. When it was all over they were trapped, just huge specimens of what one might have expected to see traveling round in the glacial period. They were all rosen up, everything except language and that was of a kind to prove that there was considerable caloric left on the inside. And the heat soon wore through the crust, for even Montreal's best brand of snow could not withstand the igneous eruptions that took place where snowbanks sunk as it cues, big sleighs and other things should be. Fortunately there was nobody hurt, and no barbed wire reached out its hand to gather in any bits of superfluous clothing. There were some gloves left in the capacious maw of that snowbank, a job lot of assorted rubbers, a few eyeglasses, and other small things easily replaced, but there was tumultuous laughter and it was a romantic wind-up to one of the jolliest and most enjoyable functions that ever graced the hospitable halls of the St. George Snowshoe Club. The only anachronism in the whole thing was a middle-aged gentleman, clothed in gold-rimmed spectacles, an incipient Italian moustache, several coon skins, and a quantity of easy dignity that glued him to his seat. When the sleigh toppled into the ditch he objected to leave it; he was the only one who recognized the usefulness of the immediate propinquity of the sleigh; he even refused to leave it when willing hands and strong arms wanted to put the sleigh right side up. He said he was the only man in the party who knew anything about staying in a sleigh under difficulties. There was no use controverting that argument, for he was in the sleigh, and the fellows were out; so the big vehicle got the runners right again without his moving, and then careful driving in the middle of the road avoided further catastrophes, so that at an early hour in the morning the veterans of the Veterans' night had scored another victory without a casualty being reported and no ambulance being called. At three o'clock in the morning, a jolly party of trampers left the Windsor; they had snowshoes with them. Some of the most daring strapped them on; a few others said they would put them on when they reached deep snow, and so lingered carefully behind. Then they manfully faced the drifts that spoil travel in the neighborhood of Peel street, and reached the clubhouse before the other fellows who had started earlier, but did not know the road so well. At 10 o'clock a comfortable looking sleigh left the same celebrated hostelry. It was filled to repletion with a couple of dozen men inclined for dinner and music. They got urns for dinner, and some of the music still lingers in the air. None of the dinner lingers; it was put away in unsearchable places, and pronounced good. The real fun began after dinner, for a musical programme had been provided that eclipsed all the records in the history of the club, and they are famous. Two hundred guests were present, and little time was wasted in toasts and responses. They were all duly honored with the soul of wit. The Harmony Band, the Zinaari Club, under the direction of Mr. Meredith Heward, Mr. J. Furnald, New York; W. Watts Hurt, San Francisco; George W. Stearns. They all enjoyed everything, and said not a word when told that being thrown into a snowbank was only an ordinary incident of snowshoe life in Canada, under the auspices of the St. George Club. OVERHAND SNOWSHOE CLUB STEEPLECHASE Westlake won again with McKenna a good second. The Overland Club steeplechase was run off on Saturday afternoon over the regular mountain course from the foot of McTavish street to the Club House. A large number of the members of this and sister clubs turned out for the occasion, and demonstrated the fact, by the interest they evinced in the race that snowshoeing is certainly not the back number which some people are led to believe. The track was very heavy, but despite the fact of a strong headwind and snowfall, the time was fast. The race was won by T. Westlake, the Canadian cross-country champion, with J. McKenna a good second. Bayers third. Peacock and Doherty put up a stiff fight for fourth place, but Doherty was beaten out at the finish. There were ten starters and the five prize winners were as follows: 1st T. Westlake; 2nd J. McKenna; 3rd W. A TRAMP TO BACK RIVER A large number of the old Tuaque Bleue Snowshoe Club tramped out to Back River on Saturday afternoon last, when a good old-fashioned snowshoe time was held. It looks as if there was to be a revival of the fine healthy old sport. SOME EXCELLENT RACING ON THE JACQUES CARTIER TRACK There was only one drawback to the races on the ice on Saturday, and that was that at an inopportune moment the snow came down in swirls, and while there was still plenty of daylight left, the falling snow, driven by a fairly stiff wind, interfered considerably with both drivers and horses. Some of the owners said they were being handicapped by the conditions, and requested the management to hold the finishes of both races over until today. A few there were among the spectators who were dissatisfied with this, but the great majority recognized the wisdom of the judges and the management, as all the horses taking part in these races are entered for the Ottawa campaign, and Monti Sal is the most convenient place to stay over at. Outside of the postponement, there was nothing to cavil at, for better racing has never been seen on the St. Lawrence. The free-for-all was a beauty from the word to the wire, and both heats were what is rightly known as real horse races. Heads apart was the order for the first three finishers, both times, and it was apparent to the veriest tyro that everybody was out for the money. It is anybody's race yet, or nobody knows the possibilities of the six horses in it. There is no doubt that before the race is over the heats will be pretty well split up. Canton got the first heat, after a hard drive, and it was nip and tuck all through the last half, but there seemed to be one horse not calculated on. That was Winfield, who had to waver all over the track. Perhaps conditions may be different today. In the second heat Canton finished first on a well-planned gallop, for which he was sent back to fourth place, and Nellie Sharper was moved up into first place, Dick French and Winfield being noses apart for second. Ada P. had a lot of followers in the pool room, but it did not seem to be the little mare's day and she served as a whipper-in. Dick French was also thought a lot about, but he did not realize his admirers' expectations. As before remarked, this race is only just begun, and anything may happen today. As to the forty class, there again was some excellent work seen, although Clay Lambert looked somewhat too good for his field, and after the first heat he sold for $10 against a field at $8.00, holding such good ones as Sir Oliver M., Johnnie P., Miss K., Hattie C., and others. When Lambert gets away first it is hard to overtake him and so on Saturday he never broke and got in two heats. The races will be finished this afternoon, beginning at 3:30. Inquiry into the cause of a little grumbling about the postponement traced it to a man who was expelled a couple of years ago for using foul language to the judges, and therefore it could be taken for what it is worth. One of the horses that started Saturday was the late Meadow Banks. This was in the 40 class. It appears that there is a mark of 29 1-8 connected with the name, and the owner will have to do some explaining today, for the penalty seems to be expulsion. The guideless pacing mare Josephine will again be on exhibition, and as the races are uncompleted ones, the management will only charge 25 cents admission. The purse of the free-for-all should be worth more than double that amount. Following is the summary: Purse $250; 1st Clay Lambert; 2nd Johnnie P.; 3rd Sir Oliver M.; 4th Hattie C.; 5th Miss K.; 6th Black Dan; 7th Minnie F.",

the gale than by freezing $6,000,000 Though the earnings are $102,000 less than in the preceding year, there will be few who will not feel that the result was a very satisfactory one The Bank of Montreal's interests are as wide as Canada itself, and usually it is affected but slightly by a depression that may visit even a large section of the country In 1891, however, it had to seek employment for the great resources at its command at a time when slowness of trade affected all parts, not of the Dominion alone, but of the commercial world There was here no crisis and no financial crash; but everywhere trade was restricted, and the demand for bank accommodation proportionately curtailed Though it is not customary to give information on such matters to the public, it is no doubt the case that to a lack of opportunity for safe employment and diminished rates of interest, and not to losses on account of bad debts, is to be ascribed the falling off in earnings in 1894 compared with 1893, Canada, in the latter year, having, it will be remembered, suffered very little from the commercial calamities that befell her neighbors The annual statement of the Bank of Montreal is always looked for at this period, both by commercial and public men It is an index of the state of trade equal in its way to the national revenue returns Whether from a shareholder's or a public man's point of view the results just announced can be viewed with content It is not minimizing the importance of the efforts of those responsible for the direction and management of the bank's affairs at such a time to say that so satisfactory an outcome could hardly have been obtained in a time of financial collapse or crisis Fortunately it can be said, also, that signs of improving trade are now visible in many quarters, and there is reason to expect that with the increasing commercial activity there will come a better demand for money for business purposes, a demand which the statement of the bank's assets shows it is in good position to meet, and profit by H Smith, an ex-conductor of the Chicago & Grand Trunk railroad, was arrested at the home of his father, near here, this morning,

which the suburban resident who has braved the sleet and snowdrifts of outrageous winters and whose chief end in life, outside of business hours, has been to keep the furnace going, reaps the reward of his labors At least it will be so when the present cold snap is over, the city resident who has sniffed pityingly at the suburbanite during the past six months will be the one to be pitied, while the suburbanite comes into town each morning redolent with bucolic happiness All sorts of jibes, jocose and otherwise, have been made by the humorist at the expense of the poor suburbanite, his garden

18981128,historical,snow,"November Snow caused a postponement of the racing at the Pennings race track this afternoon. The day a card was declared and new entries were compiled for Monday as follows: First race, selling; 5 furlongs-100 yards-Dan Hill, Azael, Hurry Crawford, Chatagrace, 100, Cam-anh, 1ona, Deu, Marslan, 8quan, Wordsworth, Endeavor, Beau Ideal, Taranto, Talisman, 50. In addition to this, the plaintiff claimed $2,000 for a puddle wall to be constructed outside the foundations to prevent the water from continuing to damage the wall. This item I refuse because the puddle wall would not be necessary if the defendant constructs it, and if it does not do so it will be liable for damages in the future. With regard to diminution in value of the property, I found the proof insufficient and I appoint experts to report on that point. They report unanimously that the property has been diminished in value by the raising of the level of the river two feet to seven feet, along a line of 60 feet, whereby the appearance of the building is materially affected, and they assess damages at $2,507.50. Amount above detailed Total under this head $3,057.50 to the next item of property as a brewery by the increased difficulty and expense of handling the product. For this item, the plaintiff claims $1,000. The proof establishes that the loading of the mash became very difficult by reason of the change of grade, and also that the grade was so steep at the place where this product was loaded that buyers refused to come, and a considerable portion thereof could not be sold and had to be thrown away; also that the beer, which before the change of level was simply rolled into the express wagons, had now to be lifted, incurring a considerable extra expense. The plaintiff's proof indicates that the extra costs under this head would amount to between $200 and $400 per annum. If this be the case, and the defendant has led no evidence to contradict it or to show that remedy could be applied to avoid or diminish such extra cost, I cannot think that the sum demanded by the plaintiff is excessive. I therefore grant the plaintiff the sum of $1,000. The next item, namely, for damages from flooding, for which the plaintiff claims $2,500, must be understood to refer to the costs of cleaning after the various floodings, as the other damages by water have been already taken up. I am disposed to think that this item has not been satisfactorily proved, beyond the sum of $100, for which the plaintiff must have judgment. There remains the item of $1,000 claimed by the plaintiff for half the value of the mitoyen wall used by the defendant. The proof offered by the plaintiff brings this item up to $195.50. The defendant has offered proof on this point, which reduces this item to $116.97. I am disposed to adopt this latter figure. There is another item which I think it is reasonable to award to the plaintiff. The circumstances of the case were such as to require an examination by experts before bringing the action. This the plaintiff did and the value of these services is proved in the case as follows: THE RAILWAYS BLOCKADED New York Has to Go Back Ten Years for a Storm as Big and Boston to 1881 for a Comparison. New York, November 27. When the people of New York awoke this morning they found the blizzard that raged when they retired was still in progress. The storm, which had begun with the soft, sleety snow on Saturday, at noon had increased greatly, and with the heavier snowfall, the wind was blowing a gale at midnight. There was a slight abatement of the wind this morning, but the snow still fell, and drifted high, and the temperature dropped rapidly. It looked this morning as though the blizzard would continue all day, but at 10 o'clock there was a breaking away in the west, a brightening of the light, and finally the storm ceased altogether, and the greatest blizzard since the memorable one of March, 1888, came to an end. With the brightening of the skies in this city this morning, came an increase in the velocity of the wind, and the loose dry snow was sent swirling and eddying everywhere. Nearly a foot of snow had fallen, but in places it had drifted to four and five feet. Broadway and all the great thoroughfares of the city presented a fantastic appearance. There were drifts on the sidewalks through which the early morning wayfarer ploughed to his waist. In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity. As soon as there were signs of abatement in the fall of snow, the street cleaning department went to work. But there was very little progress made. The street railroad ploughs had thrown up huge banks of snow on either side of the rails, forming an almost impassable barrier to anything but sleighs, very few of which were out. The street cleaning department, with its limited resources, removed a few thousand loads from the principal thoroughfares, but this made an impression on the banks that was scarcely noticeable. CAR LINES BLOCKED Today the cable roads were more fortunate than the trolley lines. Nearly every underground trolley line in the city was inoperative all day, owing to the filling up of the slot by freezing sleet, and then filling the conduit with snow and sleet, thus making the trolley wires unavailable. Hundreds of men were employed by the trolley companies to put them in condition, but their efforts were futile. Suburban traffic was blocked for several hours in the morning and after that trains ran at long intervals. All trains were delayed. Some that were due in the early morning hours had not been heard from at night. The superintendent of mails in the general Post Office reported that the mail train from Boston, due at 6 a.m., had not been heard from, nor had the mails been received up to 10 o'clock tonight. The incoming mails from other parts, he said, were from two hours to an unknown number of hours behind time. The damage to small shipping in the harbor and down the bay was very great. It is reported tonight that several tug boats belonging to the Kingston Towing Company, together with a large number of canal boats, were sunk up the river by the force of the gale. The shores of the Hudson are littered with wreckage. At 9 o'clock this morning a fleet of twenty-two ocean-going steamships were anchored in the bay. The Lucania, more than 21 hours behind her schedule, was the first of the liners to weigh anchor and put to sea. The others bound east and south followed soon after, one by one. An order was sent out from police headquarters to the various precinct commanders to have arrested all persons found alone in a condition that would raise even the suspicion of intoxication. As a result, the police courts today were crowded with eminently respectable looking persons who were let go with a small fine and an admonition to get in out of the snow. Notwithstanding this precaution on the part of the police, there were a number of casualties, including several deaths from exposure. HIT BOSTON, TOO Boston, Mass, November 27. A record-breaking November blizzard swept over the greater portion of New England last night and today, completely demoralizing traffic of every description and well nigh paralysing telegraphic and telephonic communication, while the northeast gale, coming on a high course of tides, drove the sea far beyond its usual limits and made a mark along shore only exceeded by the memorable hurricane of 1801. The heaviest part of the storm was in the southwestern part of New England, that section experiencing a snowfall of from 18 to 24 inches. Fortunately the storm was heralded sufficiently in advance by the Weather Bureau to detain most of the coastwise shipping in safe harbors, but the warning was entirely ignored by those on shore, with the result that nearly everyone, especially the railroads and electric companies, were caught napping and suffered accordingly. There was not a railroad in New England that was not more or less tied up by the storm. Trains north, east, south, and west were nearly all stalled early in the night, although one train from Bangor reached Lynn this morning, and two Chicago trains came into the city this evening. In cities and towns dependent upon electric car service it was even worse, for the damp snow packed hard on the rails and held up even the very snow ploughs. The service in this city was probably the best of any of the surrounding communities, yet even here there was no attempt made to run more than a dozen cars on Wellington Street and one or two others of the main thoroughfares. During the gale last night and this morning thirty barges and schooners lying in Boston harbor were wrecked and sunk and at least twelve lives lost. The Wilson liner Ohio is ashore at Spectacle Island, in the bay. No serious damage is expected. Only the barest reports were received tonight of the effects of the storm on the coast, but even those gave rise to the gravest fears for the safety of what little shipping may have been off Cape Cod last night or today. It will probably be two or three days before a complete list of the disasters can be made. All points south of this city and east of Providence were isolated early in the evening, New Bedford being lost to the outside world before eight o'clock, while Newport and Fall River disappeared into the night long after. Farther to the west at Providence and in other parts of Rhode Island, communication was intermittent and subject to great delay. Night trains over the shore line to New York reached Providence with only a few minutes delay, but beyond that point they met terrific drifts, and it was morning before either of the two regular trains reached New London. Here they were stalled nearly all day by freight wrecks in the road between that point and New Haven. AT OTHER POINTS Hartford, Conn, November 27. The storm in this city is the heaviest known since the blizzard of 1888. The snow is about two feet on a level, and is drifted badly. Trains on the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad were much delayed. The train from New York Saturday night reached here at 4 o'clock this afternoon, 14 hours behind time. Trolley travel has been entirely suspended during the day, but some short lines are being cleared up this evening. John A. Horn, an electrician, was killed on the Glastonbury line this morning while working at clearing the track. He was shifting the trolley bar when he was struck by a snow plow. Nyack, N.Y, November 27. A storm raged through Rockland County last night and today, doing much damage. The snow drifts are from three to seven feet high, and have made traveling through the county impossible on some roads. This has been the severest snowstorm since 1888. St. John B, November 27. Winter struck in with a rush this morning, a furious northeast gale prevailing all day. The wind blew down chimneys on St. Luke's and the Coburg Street churches, breaking valuable stained glass windows, overturning trees and sweeping down fences in many parts of the city. Only about three inches of snow fell, but the drifts steadily demolished the street railway service, which was caught napping. AS TO KING MENELEK British Policy Is to Compel Him to Stay at Home Not Much Credence Placed in the Story That He Has Taken to the Warpath With 100,000 Men London, November 27. There has been much wild telegraphing from Rome, Cairo and elsewhere about the mysterious movements of King Menelek. Most of these rumors come from Rome, where Menelek is somewhat of a bogey. The Daily Mail's correspondent at Rome says that Menelek has left Addis Ababa at the head of 100,000 men, which is an absolutely disproportionate force for the quelling of Ras Mangascia, who has only about 6,000 men. The suggestion, therefore, is that Menelek is making for Uuhr-el-Qhuzel. Menelek is certainly somewhat of a problem, but these stories are probably gross exaggerations. According to the best obtainable information, he has only 40,000 men in the field, while Mangascia is strong enough to find them employment. According to Lieut. Harrington, the British military representative in Abyssinia, Menelek is still sitting on the fence, endeavoring to play off one European power against the other. Such a policy is elementary and probable. It is unlikely that Menelek will interfere with Marchand's expedition through his country, and it is equally and even more unlikely that he is meditating the immediate provocation of England. If Menelek's object is to establish a kingdom, any premature trouble with England, he well knows, will spoil this. Meanwhile, British policy is determined that Menelek must stay at home. Under no circumstances will the Abyssinian frontier be allowed to extend beyond the Nile. THE WEATHER Fair, With Stationary or Slightly Higher Temperature Toronto, Ont, November 27. A severe storm covers the Maritime Provinces, attended by heavy gales and snow and rain. Pronounced depressions also exist in the Northwest Territories and the west southwest States. Minimum and maximum temperatures Victoria, 42, 50; Kamloops, 30, 40; Calgary, 18, 38; Qu'Appelle, 10, 20; Parry Sound, 6, 30; Toronto, 8, 28; Ottawa, 10, 28; Montreal, 12, 22; Quebec, 6, 20; Halifax, 30, 40. Ottawa Valley and Upper and Lower St. Lawrence Fair, stationary, or slightly higher temperature. Montreal observations taken at 11 a.m. The recent comparatively mild weather which has prevailed in Great Britain has been interrupted by a thorough blizzard in many parts of the country, especially in the North, where the snowdrifts have been several feet deep. Three men perished in the snow in the Highlands, a train was blown off the rails near Tralee, Ireland, numbers of fishing boats have been lost, many fishermen have perished, and the Irish mail boats and cross-channel mail services were interrupted or seriously delayed. The Belfast mail boat was twenty hours in making a trip which is usually accomplished in six hours, trains have been snowed up at several places, and, generally, the snowstorm is considered to have been the worst for many years. The severe weather reached as far south as the Mediterranean, where a French transport, bound for Tunis, was obliged to return to Toulon in a damaged condition. She also reported that some of the recruits on board of her were killed or injured during the storm. THE QUEEN Queen Victoria is taking keen interest just now in the progress of the scheme for connecting Cape Town with Cairo. She conversed with General Lord Kitchener on the subject during his recent visit to Her Majesty, and she expressed the hope of living to see it carried through. The dislike of the Queen for the late William K. Gladstone was well known, but since the death of the great statesman Her Majesty has given several proofs of her kindly regard for Mrs. Gladstone, the widow. She has written frequently to the latter, enquiring very compassionately regarding her health, and expressing the hope that her bereavement has now lost its keenness. Mrs. Gladstone has been greatly touched by the tenderness and sympathy which marked these epistles. Her health has improved during the last few weeks. There is some discussion this week as to whether the Queen will again go to the south of France next spring, in view of the Anglophobe feeling excited by the Fashoda dispute. An article by M. Paul Necassagnac, in the Autorité, has especially given offense here. He declared that the visit of the Queen to Cannes would be an insult, and he expressed the hope that Her Majesty would have more tact than to provoke a demonstration of ill-feeling by her presence on French territory at the present moment, when, he adds, Great Britain is doing her best to humiliate France. These outbursts on the part of the French newspapers are having a certain effect, and letters are appearing in the English newspapers urging that pressure be exercised in the proper quarters to induce the Queen not to go to the French Riviera, but to go to Florence instead.

point, The question had never before been raised in this form, When Mr Tarte arrived he explained the facts to him, and the latter affirmed that what Mr Crankshaw called the scum-laden article of the Herald was true in all particulars, and in effect gave the lie to the revising Barrister, finally he apologized for his statements, An appeal may be taken by Mr Maclennan, Maclennan, A Street Railway Communication, To the Editor of the Gazette: Sir, In the matter of the Street railway and salt, Montreal seems to be in just as bad a plight as St John, but in Ottawa, where the use of salt is prohibited, there seems to be no trouble, The following would appear to be a way of getting over any trouble there may be, and keeping the streets in good condition for sleighing, Let the car company provide a tank car, something such as they use in Toronto for summer street watering, and beside, with perhaps rollers, hangers and ice cutting plough, to cut the ice down at the rails and round the surface up between and at each side, Instead of salting the street promiscuously let them water the snow when the thermometer is well below freezing, Once having brought the surface into proper shape it would last well, the plough would clear it easily, and the snow would not be continually working back on the rails, As it thawed it could from time to time be built up again by a further watering on cold nights, J, dissenting, Mowub (defendant in court below), appellant, and Malo (plaintiff in court below), respondent The appeal was from a judgment which condemned the appellant to pay the respondent the sum of $134, Wurtele, J, giving the judgment of the court, said that appellant was the owner of three cottages at Longueuil, They had been damaged by the ice, and he was desirous of having the damage repaired, He asked de Martigny if he knew anyone who could repair the houses for him, They went over to Longueuil together, and Ferland, a contractor, said the work could be done for $150, Ferland stated afterwards that he meant $150 per house, De Martigny told appellant the work could be done for $150, and appellant instructed him to go on and get it done, He thereby constituted de Martigny his agent for the repair of the three houses, De Martigny told Ferland to do the work, There was no contract, Ferland ordered lumber from the respondent De Martigny gave respondent a note for the amount of his account When it became due, it was not paid, Malo took an action against de Martigny and obtained judgment, but there was a return of nulla bona, Malo then sued appellant and obtained judgment against him, and the appeal was from this judgment, The question was whether the principal was liable under the circumstances, The majority of the court were of opinion that article 1710 of our code, which states that a mandatary who acts in his own name is liable to the third party with whom he contracts without prejudice to the rights of the latter against the mandator also, governed the present case, The judgment of the court below was therefore well founded, and it was maintained, Blanchet, J, dissenting, Lonnitrs (defendant in court below), appellant, and DomoN (plaintiff in court below), respondent, The judgment appealed from maintained an action by respondent and awarded him the sum of $100 for the loss of four fingers of his left hand, Respondent was employed in appellant's shop, and while planing a piece of wood on a planing machine, the accident occurred, It was contended by the appellant that the accident was due wholly to respondent's negligence; that the machine was in perfect order, and that a guard was attached to it for the protection of the workmen, and that if this guard was not on the machine at the time, respondent could easily have obtained it The court was unanimously of the opinion that the judgment could not be sustained, The weight of evidence was to the effect that the accident occurred through respondent's carelessness in using the machine without the guard, in disobedience of the directions given to him, He was a skilled workman and accustomed to the use of the machine, and knew the danger of using it without the guard, The judgment was therefore reversed and the action dismissed, CORPORATION OF THE VILLAGE OF DUNHAM (defendant in court below), appellant, and Garick (plaintiff in court below), respondent, The appeal was from a judgment rendered by the Superior Court in the district of Bedford, condemning appellant to pay respondent $75 damages suffered by him while driving a vehicle on the highway, While passing over a small bridge the horses took fright and the vehicle went over the edge of the bridge, and respondent was injured, The question was whether the appellant was bound to provide hand-rails to make the bridge safe, The court below maintained the action, and this decision was unanimously confirmed by the Court of Appeal, CIKMAN (defendant in court below), appellant, and Jkhomk (plaintiff in court below), respondent The appeal was from a judgment which maintained respondent's action and condemned appellant to pay $200 and interest, The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, Blanchet, J, dissenting, Davidson et al, (defendants in court below), appellants, and Thiemhlay (plaintiff in court below), respondent This was another case of employer's liability, The judgment condemned appellants to pay respondent $2,000 damages alleged to have been sustained by him by reason of the death of his minor son, caused by an accident while in appellants' employment The court was of opinion that the weight of evidence was against the appellants, The presumption of negligence was against them from the fact that the law was not complied with as respects covering the belt and providing guards for the machinery, After reviewing the facts of the case, the court came to the conclusion that the judgment should not be disturbed, and it was confirmed in all respects, Coohi, in (defendant in court below), appellant, and Pake (plaintiff in court below), respondent, Hall, J, said that the action was by a proprietor against his tenant, The roof of the building occupied by the tenant fell in, According to respondent's pretension the accident occurred owing to the weight of snow on the roof, The roof was repaired by the proprietor, now respondent, and the present action was to recover the cost The rule of law was that the tenant is responsible unless he can show that the injury resulted from no fault on his part The court did not think that the tenant in this case had proved that the injury occurred without any fault of his, The evidence showed that there was a large quantity of snow upon the roof, and the court was of opinion that this accumulation of snow was the primary cause of the accident, The tenant was in default to remove the snow and, under the circumstances, the judgment of the Court of Review, which held the tenant responsible, was well founded, and it was confirmed, The Chief Justice stated that judgment in the case of Drysdale and Dugas would not be rendered at present, It would, perhaps, be given on Thursday, In the afternoon the hearing of the case of Wineberg, appellant, and Hampson, respondent, was commenced, Messrs Green Shields, Q A LONDON STORY, The under and I, luhli, ing, Know, Hitil huh Buanhtue in Three Hours, London, January 23, A heavy snowstorm prevailed in London during the night and turned into rain this morning, At 6:20 this morning the sky suddenly became dark, the darkness resembling that of nightfall, and a violent hailstorm, accompanied by thunder and lightning, set in, The thunder and hailstorm lasted until ten o'clock, when snow began to fall again, The snow fell for about an hour, when the skies cleared and the sun shone brightly, The storm caused a tremendous rising of the Thames, Thousands of acres at Windsor and Felton are flooded, and many other sections are submerged, The violence of the wind unrooted trees, and at Kingston several brick walls were blown down, The steeple of St Stephen's church, Westminster, was struck by lightning and set on fire, but the flames were extinguished before any serious damage was done, Three persons, in different parts of London, were killed by lightning, and the roofs of a number of houses were struck and slightly damaged, A high northwest wind is blowing over the channel, Tugs sent out from Dover are helping many vessels in distress, The night mail boats are not making their usual trips, French fishermen found

18870401,historical,snow,"THE BLOCKADE RAISED The railway traffic which has been demoralized for some days past on account of the heavy snowstorm is again resuming its normal condition The block on the intercolonial has been raised and the first mail from the lower provinces for a week was distributed last night Ten engines and snow ploughs were employed clearing the track Mr Daley, the Dominion immigration agent, received the following telegram yesterday morning from Campbellton, N.U. Johnson, J. This was an action of damages against the railway company brought by the widow and children of the late Norman McDonald for having, by the fault and negligence of the company, caused the death of the husband and father, and a most distressing case in itself of course it is, though, unfortunately, what distresses and disturbs does not tend to give any one a clearer view of their right under the law This young man, now dead, and leaving behind him a young widow and several children, who say the railway company are responsible for his death, left his house on the morning of the 5th of April, 1886, and went with another man called Donald Smith, and a pair of horses and a sled to the woods where they loaded up with some heavy logs, and started thence to draw them to the saw mill, having on their route to cross the railway track, which they reached without much difficulty, though the snow in some places had disappeared The load was drawn up the incline onto the track, which was bare of snow; but there it stuck, and the horses could get it no further The train came down rounding a curve towards the spot where the sleigh had stuck on the track; and there is evidence that if the engine driver had shifted his seat from the convex to the concave side of the curve he might have seen the obstruction somewhat sooner; but it was a downgrade at that place; and he only succeeded in stopping the engine after it had struck the loaded sleigh The unfortunate man MacDonald would have had time to save himself, by getting out of the way after he saw the train coming, for he and his load remained on the track some ten minutes; but he put himself most unfortunately where he would have been in all probability sure to suffer if his load should be struck by the engine; and accordingly, when it was struck, it was dashed with tremendous force against him, and he was killed The action in the usual form alleged negligence and fault on the part of the company with all the other necessary allegations required by the circumstances; and particularly set forth that the accident was a direct consequence of the bad condition of the railway crossing which the company were bound by law to keep so that the rails should not be more than one inch above or below the level of the road, while they were alleged to be eleven inches above the level The conclusion was for $20,000 The defendants pleaded, first, an express denial of each of the allegations of the plaintiff, and they further pleaded contributory negligence by the deceased himself in respect of the bare state of the roads, the weight of the load, and the weakness of the horses; and that the deceased had resided close by, and knew when the train was due; and in spite of all this attempted imprudently to cross the track; that the bell was rung and the train was stopped as soon as possible; that it was running at an ordinary rate, and on time; and the deceased with common caution could have escaped, but placed himself behind his load so as inevitably to bring about his own death The issues of fact were tried at Sherbrooke by a jury, and they found on the evidence that there had been no fault or negligence on the part of the defendants; but that there had been negligence on the part of the deceased, to which his death was directly attributable This is the effect of the finding of the jury; and the plaintiff on the ground that it is against the evidence, moves for a new trial The several questions (thirty-four in number) submitted to the jury cover every fact of importance that can bear upon these two main points, viz: the fault and negligence of the defendants, and the fault and negligence of the deceased; and the principal particulars of negligence urged against the defendants were the level of the rails being above the legal limit; and the fault of the engine driver in not stopping sooner The jury found both against the plaintiff's pretensions, and though they were particularly told, as to the latter point, that if the engine driver could have stopped sooner by doing anything he had omitted to do, they found clearly in answer to the 23rd, 24th, 25th, and 26th questions, that everything was done that could have been done; the bell was rung; and whether the driver had seen a few moments sooner or not would have made no difference on that descending grade With respect to the level of the rails, the law cited is in the statute 42 Vic, ch. 9 sec. 15, subsections 2 and 4 The provisions are very clear and easily understood It provides that on the highway or right of passage over the track to which the public is entitled, the rails must not be more than an inch above or below the level of the way, and as I understand the evidence, that was proved by the defendants' witnesses It is true that there was evidence on both sides The friends of the deceased on the one side, who made no measurements; the witnesses for the defendants on the other, who did take precise measurements, and it cannot be said, if the jury was to estimate and weigh the value of the evidence on both sides, that they have found against evidence by saying in effect that they prefer the proof of the defendants on this point to that of the plaintiff It was their right to say so; and I must say I agree with them The fourth subsection, which was altered by the second statute, does not affect the case at all Then, on the other issue, viz, the want of care and prudence in this poor man who met his death, this subject was spread over several questions, and the jury found in answer to the seventeenth and eighteenth, that the road was bare of snow and the men were driving a heavy load for such roads; and in answer to the twenty-first, that the deceased was familiar with the crossing and knew the time the train was due Besides this the jury found in their answer to the twenty-seventh question, in the most direct manner that McDonald was guilty of rashness, recklessness and imprudence in attempting to cross the railway at that particular time of the day and season of the year; and to the twenty-eighth they say also with equal plainness that the deceased did, by his own acts and negligence, contribute to bring about his own death It could not be maintained; it was not argued, I believe, that on this last part of the case (the fault of the man himself), the jury had found against evidence Therefore, upon the whole case, we are obliged to say the verdict should stand The plaintiff sued in forma pauperis, and the defendants, of course, though they have the right to judgment for costs, will not, we hope, exercise it under the circumstances David vs. La Compagnie de Jurisprudence et al Johnson, J. This was an action of damages for libel The defendant's journal, Le Monde, published in a paragraph on the 9th October that, on the day before, in the plaintiff's presence, he being then a candidate for Parliament, a sum of $2,000 had been offered to one Lemay, a supporter of the other candidate, Mr. Gravel, to get the latter to retire and so secure the vote of the workingmen for the plaintiff The judgment went against the printing company only, and exonerated the editor and manager personally The company now inscribes: It had pleaded to the action that the article was published in good faith and was true, and published for the public benefit If it meant anything it meant that an act of corruption was committed before the plaintiff's face, for his benefit, and with his approval The proof did not sustain that at all, but something very different and which in no way reflected discredit on the plaintiff The judgment gave $200 on damages There cannot be the slightest doubt that the defendants did not prove what they pleaded, the offer of the money for the purpose they had said They admitted the publication, and of course damages were due, but we are in reality asked to reduce the damages, that is all No pretext whatever was suggested for such a step on our part, it is not a matter of fancy or arbitrary will We have no right to touch a judgment of the court without a sufficient reason, and none whatever is alleged Judgment confirmed O'Connor vs. Grand Trunk Railway Co Johnson, J. The trial of the issues of fact in this case was had before a special jury: and they found unanimously a verdict which on the face of it clearly entitles the defendants to judgment dismissing the plaintiff's action; and accordingly they move for judgment in their favor; but the plaintiff comes with a motion for a new trial on grounds of misdirection, admission of illegal evidence, and of verdict rendered without evidence, and contrary to evidence The point of misdirection was not heard, as there was nothing of record as required by law to show what the direction was Therefore, the points are reduced to the evidence and the rulings at the trial The action was to recover $896 as the alleged value of a quantity of railway ties which the defendants were alleged to have permitted to be put where they were afterwards consumed by fire, attributed to their fault and negligence The defendants denied any such permission, and any such neglect or fault on their part, and said, on the contrary, that the plaintiff put his ties on the property of the railway at his own risk; and was in fact a trespasser, and had no right of action against them, if his ties were destroyed And further, the defendants pleaded that before action brought, the plaintiff had waived and discontinued his pretensions The plaintiff made answer to that part of the plea, denying all permission to him to place his ties on their property by setting up an alleged custom of the people about there, who had ties to sell, of placing them alongside the track on the railway property, and alleged that the defendants had acquiesced in such a custom The real issues for the jury were three: First the permission, secondly the fault of the defendants, and thirdly the waiver; and these questions were amplified and diluted into a number of minor particulars, according to the practice The jury found that there was no permission, and no custom of the kind that was set up They also found there was no fault or negligence by the company; and thirdly, they found the plaintiffs had withdrawn and waived, before they brought their action, all their claims arising out of this matter The plaintiff contends now that he proved this usage He cannot contend, of course, that he proved a permission, for the evidence is in the teeth of such a pretension There was evidence on the subject no doubt, but it did not satisfy the jury, that it amounted to a custom known to and tolerated by the defendants, still less assented to, or binding upon them A few persons may have had the bad habit of trespassing in this manner, as a few fools will still continue to jump on trains in motion, but neither in the one case nor in the other is the """"custom"""" so called, one in which railway companies can be assumed to participate without more distinct proof than there has been in this case The next issue was the fault and negligence of the defendants in setting fire, of course, the defendants as a railway company, will have some difficulty in running their trains, unless they may lawfully use fire to raise steam for their engines, and within the limits of their own property, I do not see that anyone can complain if he chooses to come without their permission, and, so to speak, bring with him a bundle of sticks, and poke them into the fires in use on the line if the sticks should be burnt up Therefore, unless the finding on this head were shown to be against evidence, we are not held to go any further into the other points, but may properly say the burning of wood placed on the railway property close to their track without any permission, express or implied, gives no right of action against the company, but is a thing occurring entirely by the fault of the person who put the wood there in a place exposed to fire But in point of fact the findings as to the defendants' negligence, or even as to the cause of the fire, excluding the idea of their negligence, are all in accordance with the proof, as the jury had a right to appreciate that proof There was circumstantial evidence that the fire might have come from the defendants' engines; there was a probability of such a thing in the absence of any other assignable cause, and the jury were so told by the court; but the fact was entirely within their province, and they found against the plaintiff; they found there was no proof, and unless we can say what is the precise amount of proof that ought to satisfy a jury one way or the other, it is impossible to find fault with the verdict in this particular; otherwise it is no longer a trial of the facts by a jury, but by the court But this circumstantial evidence of the possibility or probability of the cause of the fire was met by a most complete and careful, I may add, scientific evidence to show that that particular engine could not, on the two days alleged, have set the fire All that would remain would be the question of waiver, It is with respect to the admission of evidence on this head that the ruling at the trial is complained of; but it is unnecessary to proceed to that part of the case, either as regards the facts or the law, since the evidence of absence of permission or custom, and that of fault or negligence on the defendant's part amply sustains the findings on those points, and fully disposes of the case I ought, perhaps, to cite, in view of the abuse of the motion for new trial in almost all jury cases in this court, an authority of the highest description that ought to serve to mitigate the indiscriminate infliction of them except in cases resting on distinct principle It is the case of the Metropolitan Railway Company vs. Wright, decided last year in the House of Lords, and it is Lord Selborne's judgment What concerns the case in hand is this: """"In many cases the principles on which new trials should be granted on the ground of difference of opinion which may exist as to the effect of the evidence, have been considered both in the House of Lords and in the lower courts; and have always understood that it is not enough that the judge who tried the case might have come to a different conclusion from the jury, or that the judges in the court where the new trial is moved for might have come to a different conclusion; but there must be such a preponderance of evidence, assuming there is evidence on both sides to go to the jury, as to make it unreasonable and almost perverse that the jury, when instructed and assisted properly by the judge, should return such a verdict If this is the law of trial by jury we cannot properly interfere with this case The jury were unanimous and no injustice appears Therefore the plaintiff's motion is dismissed and the defendants' motion for judgment is granted with costs (To be Continued) ENJOY LIFE What a truly beautiful world we live in!

18981124,historical,snow,"FIRST OF THE SEASON Severe Snowstorms in North Britain and the Midlands London November 23 Severe snowstorms prevailed today over the Midlands and North Britain, and heavy gales are sweeping the coasts. Train and mail boats have been delayed. In Sheffield the storm is described as a blizzard, and in Manchester the street and railway traffic is badly crippled. A despatch from Brussels says that the Belgian coast was swept by a storm yesterday, and that great damage was done. A despatch from Amsterdam says that the steamer Montenegro went ashore in the storm near Texel Island, in the North Sea. London, November 23 The fierce winds, accompanied by a sudden cold snap, have proved serious over the whole northern portion of the kingdom. The snow has caused many blockades and a number of accidents on the railways. Along the coast there have been numerous wrecks, and the lifeboats have been in constant requisition. The Channel traffic is practically suspended, and the hotels at Calais on the French side are crowded with travellers waiting to cross to Dover. Offer for Philippines PRESENT OPINION IN PARIS No Session of the Commission Was Held Yesterday Pending the Arrival of Instructions From Spain Paris, November 23 At the request of the Spanish peace commissioners, there will be no joint session today, pending instructions from Madrid. The date of the next meeting is not fixed. The postponement of today is regarded as a hopeful sign that the treaty will be signed. While the Madrid Government has not yet received the text of the American ultimatum, the Spanish ministers received quite enough by telegraph on Monday night to enable them to instruct their commissioners to retire, were such their intentions. Madrid, November 23 A semi-official note issued today contains an appeal to all Spaniards to furnish assistance to save the national credit, if they do not wish foreign capital to be withdrawn from Spain. The note adds: Some people believe Cuba ought to assume her own debt, no matter in whose hands is her sovereignty, because she herself possesses the security therefor in the form of the customs. If, however, nobody will assume the debt, Spain must pay what Cuba cannot, because Spain made herself responsible. Continuing, the note reads: With respect to the debt of the Philippine Islands, Spain must await a definite treaty of peace in order to know what conditions America will impose upon Spain through the Paris peace commissioners. London, November 23 The Madrid correspondent of the Daily Mail says: Ministers deny that the Americans have offered Spain equal commercial privileges in the Philippines. They declare on the contrary that the United States commissioners have only offered to negotiate after a peace treaty has been signed, a special commercial treaty with regard to Spanish commerce. The Americans have demanded Young Island, in the Caroline group, as a coaling and cable station. London, November 24 The Berlin correspondent of the Times, who remarks this morning on the scepticism of the German critics regarding the sincerity of America's intention to adopt the open door policy in the Philippines, and calls attention to German speculation on the prospect of protection in the American possessions in the Pacific, says: The Neuest Nachrichten draws attention to the treaty of 1877 between Spain, Great Britain and Germany, securing freedom of trade in the Sulu archipelago for Anglo-German shipping and says that Prince Bismarck at that time successfully contested Spain's claim to have the Sulu Islands regarded as belonging to the Philippine group. The correspondent draws attention to the fact that a section of the German press hastily assumes that America will claim the Sulus, and suggests that this is a point upon which an understanding with Great Britain, with a view to joint action, appears indispensable. London, November 24 The Daily News in an editorial reference to the open door policy in the Philippines and the constitutional difficulty it presents to America says: In the United States themselves opinion is sharply divided over the future of the Philippines. Enthusiasm for American expansion will be considerably abated if it means a proportionate extension of the Dingley tariff. EMPEROR WILLIAM Landed From the Hohenzollern and Started by Train for Munich Pola, Austria, November 23 The imperial yacht Hohenzollern, with the Emperor and Empress of Germany on board, arrived here today. She was saluted by the forts and Austrian warships. The latter were decorated with flags. The Archduke and Archduchess Karl Stephan, the naval commander-in-chief and the port officials boarded the Hohenzollern and officially welcomed the Emperor and Empress to Austria. After visiting the Austrian warships, the Emperor and Empress of Germany took lunch on board the Archduke's yacht and then boarded a train bound for Munich. Nominated for Nipissing North Bay, Ont, November 23 A Liberal convention was held here today in the district court house at 3 o'clock for the purpose of nominating a candidate for the coming bye-election for Nipissing. A large number of delegates were present, there being 119 votes or proxies. Mr. John Loughrin, the late member, was again nominated unanimously. FAIR AND COLDER, With a Few Local Snow Flurries, Say the Probs Toronto, Ont, November 23 11 p.m. The important disturbance which was centred over the straits of Mackinaw last night has completely dispersed, and high pressure is now spreading throughout the continent.

Every man on the FACTS ABOUT BABIES What woman doesn't want a baby, a dimpling, laughing darling, dainty enough to be cradled in a snow-white lily? Every womanly woman wants one, but she doesn't want too dainty a baby. A baby's cheeks may be too waxen-white and its body too puny, and when that's the case, baby's cheeks won't dimple or its lips laugh, and death is in its eyes. Above all things a woman wants a healthy baby, and she may have one if she will but use the right remedy for weakness and disease of the delicate and important organs that make baby a possibility. Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription is the best of all medicines for prospective or would-be mothers, it makes a woman's distinctive organism strong, healthy and vigorous. It allays inflammation, soothes pain and heals ulceration. It banishes the discomforts of the waiting time and makes the little newcomer's entree to the world easy and almost painless. It insures baby's health. In writing for advice to Dr. A. H. Brock, 811 Park Road, Hubwald, Minnesota, one man said: I have been married seven years and had no children, and after taking Dr. Pierce's treatment I had a child in a year. The other one was born within a year and a half, after going six years without having any children. I do not know how the third one came out, for we moved away. Torpid liver and constipation are surely and speedily cured by Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets. They never gripe. They regulate, tone up and invigorate the liver, stomach and bowels. No substitute urged by merchants or secretaries is as good. C3 army supplied himself with red stockings, blue jerseys, and blue vests. Captain Thrift Burnside, of Varsity, will act as referee, as Jack Connell is on the sick list with a sore throat. The team left for Buffalo this evening. MISCELLANEOUS LOVE SPOUT In speaking of the new Governor-General, the London World says: As a thorough sportsman, you may be sure he will speak about the excellent sport he had with the hounds in the country around Montreal and Toronto, and now he is looking forward to having equally good sport with them again. He does not intend, however, to take any hunters with him, for one reason that very excellent animals bred from important sires can be purchased in the Dominion; while for another he has not kept up much of a hunting stud since the bad fall he got a year and a half ago with the Duke of Buccleuch's pack. When in Canada he had also very good salmon fishing on the Cascapedia, and although that river, where the fish average quite twenty-five pounds, has slipped out of the hands of the Government, yet that is not the only water in Canada, as Lord Minto remarks, with a smile, where good fishing may be had. The great skirt which Lady Minto possesses as a skater, and which she frequently displayed at the Prince's and Niagara Clubs, was acquired on her former visit to the country, where skating, tobogganing and ski-running can be enjoyed without stint. As regards ski-running your host expressed some curiosity to witness it, the sport being comparatively of recent introduction, when accompanying French's Scouts and Boulton's Horse, who were of such service in aiding the British expedition in the suppression of the Riel Insurrection, Lord Minto saw a great deal of the Northwest Territories. These provinces interested him greatly at the time, and are now, of course, deserving of still closer attention; and while he shows you some snowshoes, moccasins, and many other North American curiosities, not omitting a handsome quiver made of unplucked beaver, a native now covered with the skin of a rattlesnake, and a shoulder strap embroidered by hand with the most beautiful work to be seen outside a museum, he brings home a vivid picture by his description of the country at the time, the rapid strides these northern provinces have made in the last fifteen years. THE QUEBEC HARVEST The Official Report a Fairly Satisfactory One The principal Department of Agriculture issued a bulletin on the state of the crops at the end of September and in October. The 1897 harvest, it says, is very good and the figure which it represents is much higher than last year. Last year the general average of all the crops amounted to 66, while this year it has increased to 73; 67 represents an average crop. This year, clover shows the highest average and buckwheat, rye and potatoes the lowest. Fodders generally show a higher average than grains and roots. Last year grains and roots were better than the fodders. The average of the cereals is excellent and is represented by the figure 80. Oats succeeded best everywhere. The grain crop is particularly good in the counties of Chicoutimi, Saguenay and Lake St. John, as well as in the Lower St. Lawrence region; it is very good also in the first, second and seventh groups. It is in the third, eighth and ninth groups, and also towards Ottawa that it is weaker. In many localities grain has been damaged by the grub. In some places, damage has been done by rust and wet. In certain localities, owing to the rain, harvesting operations have not been conducted in as good conditions as was hoped for. Generally speaking, the wheat has been injured by frost. Nowhere is it fine. The crop of peas and beans is evenly good all over, except in Montmagny and online where it is bad. The Indian corn crop is good all over, except in Argenteuil North, Terrebonne North, Ottawa and Pontiac, where it is rather below the average. In Montmorency, Témiscouata and Saguenay, it is only a fair yield. NEW YORK New York, November 23 There was a disposition manifest to curtail operations on the stock exchange in the early hours of today's session, on account of tomorrow's holiday for one thing, and on account of one or two depressing influences in the market, which offered obstacles to the successful prosecution of the bull campaign. The snowstorm in the West, with its obstruction to traffic and reports of damage to livestock was a discouragement to advancing prices. There was rather less assurance felt also that the Northern Pacific-Oregon Navigation imbroglio was sure to be patched up, and Northern Pacific stocks and others concerned in the quarrel tended downwards. Weakness in a number of the specialties, notably Tobacco, on reports of the character of the opposition in the cigarette branch accentuated the prevailing tendency. People's Gas dropped off at one time 1 1/2, and Federal Steel continued to droop. There was a marked falling off in the recent activity in Atchison preferred, probably the reason for the depressing influences for the other stocks. There was a very marked bull spirit latent in the market, nevertheless, and it turned from these centres of depression and from the region of the snowstorm to other specialties and the eastern railroads. The movement was more marked in the coalers, and had its inception in the Reading issues. The buying of these securities was attributed to the banking interest, which yesterday advanced Southern preferred and which is dominant in Northern Pacific and has important interests in Federal Steel. How far yesterday's manipulation of Southern preferred and today's of the trading securities is designed to sustain the weak spots elsewhere in the common interest of the manipulator can only be a matter of surmise. Louisville, New York Central, Ontario & Western and a number of other eastern railways enjoyed their period of strength and aided towards the late recovery and the firm close at a level generally above yesterday's prices. Andrew McKinney & Co., members of the New York Stock Exchange, wired J.E. Fairchild, manager, 2 St. Sacramento street: The stock market was active, but irregular today, with prices towards an improvement. The delay in the reply of the Spanish peace commission was construed as favorable to an amicable settlement and a sharp advance took place. Manhattan rose about 2 percent, on rumors that a large short interest in the stock was forced to cover, and near the approach toward a change in the motive power. In the industrials there was very little of interest. The market has been very dull all day, with the usual closing up of contracts before a holiday, but without any pressure of long stocks as the feeling is very confident of an early and satisfactory settlement of our affairs with Spain. All conditions point to a better market and an advance in prices all along the list. Money easy, 2 percent.",

Lord Randolph Churchill (Conservative) moved in amendment that Bradlaugh was legally disqualified. The Attorney-General advised the House to vote neither for the motion nor for the amendment, but, as Mr. Gladstone had already advised, to permit Bradlaugh to swear, subject to subsequent legal liabilities. The motion and amendment were rejected, the former 307 to 189. Bradlaugh then took the oath, signed it without waiting for the clerk and declared, having taken the oath that he would take his seat. The Speaker told him he would obey, but would claim his seat.

METEOROLOGICAL Toronto, February 21 Meteorological Office: Drums ordered up at Halifax, Liverpool, Yarmouth, N. 403 4405 NOTRE DAME ST, Corner of St. Patrick. Our respected neighbor the Laccman expects too much. With some people dollars and cents have first place and Temperance issues have to play second fiddle, and generally those who profess most are those who are found wanting when temptation comes in the way. The Chairman said that he regretted the thin attendance; no doubt the snowstorm was the cause, but he was of the opinion that if a dividend was payable they would all be there in crowds. However, he said that each shareholder would be supplied before the next gathering with a pair of snowshoes, and then no excuse would be taken for absence. He said that the last meeting left off where they began at the first meeting, so he asked them to proceed. The Secretary read a circular, which stated that the Society started for the purpose of buying and selling for cash; that they had taken all the cash they could get and also all the goods people would give them, and although things were a little mixed, still on the whole they had been remarkably successful in filling up their shelves, but that the till was empty. The thing appeared paradoxical that they should claim success, and yet be in such a mess, but it was so. A shareholder here asked what they meant by paradoxical? Several voices: It means just the other way. Another shareholder said that he had nothing to say. He wanted cheap goods and he did not care a straw who paid the loss. He went in for cheap goods. (This remark brought out loud and prolonged applause.) A telegram was read from the Ottawa man, stating that the Montreal men were getting a reference; that they got their drinks for nothing. This was denied, and several shareholders remarked that they always paid for what they got at list prices, which were less than half of Freeman's. The Chairman stated that it was contrary to law to drink on the premises, unless in the way of sampling. After a good deal of wrangling, the conclusion arrived at was that a few samples had a good effect in getting new stock, and they would in the meantime shut one eye and say nothing. A shareholder wanted to know if in the assets anything was deducted for bad stock. The man was refused an answer, and some even hinted that he was a spy, sent there by a well-known Dry Goods firm on Notre Dame Street. No other business offering, the meeting ended where it began, seven new shares ($35) having been subscribed for conditionally.

COMMERCIAL Gazette Office, Tuesday Evening Inactivity still continues a prominent feature in the English wheat markets for cargoes in all positions, while spot offerings in Liverpool are quiet and steady. Maize was inactive for futures and firm for spot offerings. A later despatch, dated 2:30 p.m., quoted breadstuffs dull, except for corn which is firmer. The receipts of wheat in Liverpool during the past three days were 399,000 centals, 283,000 of which were from America. Beerbohm's Corn Trade List, dated January 27th, says: The annual reports received from Odessa and Nicolaieff this week show that the exports of wheat during 1881 have been very little larger than in 1880; the reason for this unexpected paucity of the shipments was the delay of about five weeks in the harvesting and thrashing operations, and the want of available means for transport. The stocks in the ports of Odessa and Nicolaieff do not show the increase over last year that might have been expected, as the following figures show: 1881, 1882.

Horace Laramoe was sentenced to $5 or 8 days for vagrancy. Hildcvort Germain, drunk, was also given $5 or 10 days, and Hannah McCreary was given $10 or three months for the same offence. There is nothing more nourishing and warming in cold weather than a cup of really good Cocoa, but the difficulty has been to obtain it pure. This may be secured at a cost of one cent for a large breakfast cup by using Cadbury's Cocoa Essence, which goes three times as far as the adulterated and starchy compounds ordinarily sold, the smallest packet making fourteen breakfast cups of strong Cocoa. A Sad Event Yesterday morning the western train bound to Montreal contained a priest from Winnipeg, named the Rev. Father Petitot, who was suffering from mental disease, another priest and an attendant. Soon after the train left Belleville Father Petitot was missed from the car, and could not be found. It is supposed that he leaped from the cars into the snow, and up to last night nothing had been seen or heard of him. Police Court At the Police Court yesterday, Etienne Jagny, aged 20, a clerk in the employ of Mr. BY THE WAY, Vennor's """"coming storm"""" has come.

18811010,historical,snow,"Arrival of the new Governor A stormy voyage Heavy snow storm St John's, October 6 The royal mail steamer Nova Scotian, Captain Richardson, arrived at seven o'clock this morning, having been detained two days on her voyage from Queenstown by uninterrupted gales of westerly and northwesterly winds. During the whole voyage westward the deck of the steamer was not dry for one hour. The new Governor for Newfoundland, recently nominated by the Queen, Sir Henry FitzHardinge Maxse, came passenger by the Nova Scotian. During the past sixteen years he administered the government of Heligoland. Throughout the Crimean war he was aide-de-camp to Lord Cardigan and was engaged in the famous charge of the Light Brigade. The then Lieutenant Maxse was one of those who came back when """"not the six hundred,"""" but he came back wounded. For his bravery he received from his sovereign several badges and decorations and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was enthusiastically received this morning and was escorted by the cavalry and infantry, constabulary of the city and by detachments from Her Majesty's steamers in port to the viceregal residence. Flags were displayed on all the public buildings and the shipping in the harbor was gaily and profusely decorated with bunting. The British steamship Juliet, Captain Williams, master, owned by Bowring Bros of Liverpool, arrived at this port early on Thursday. The Juliet is on a voyage from Dundee, Scotland, to New York, laden with iron and a general cargo of bale goods. She has on board fifty passengers for the United States. The passage from Dundee to St John's occupied twelve days and is pronounced by Captain Williams to have been boisterous beyond all his former lengthy experience on the Atlantic. From the time of leaving Dundee until last night the wind blew a tremendous gale, varying from west-southwest to northwest, but abating not one jot in violence. In fact, the Juliet may be said to have been under water for ten complete days. On Thursday last, when the storm was at its height, the sea crashed in through one of the port side-lights and carried everything before it. A poor lady passenger was dashed to leeward and had her skull fractured. She was landed this morning in a dying state with a coffined child that succumbed last night to its sufferings. A furious gale of west-northwest wind blew over the west coast of Newfoundland last night, accompanied by a driving snow. The frost was very slight. The snow fell to a depth of seven inches. The range of the gale was from St George's Bay to Bonne Bay. Sports and Pastimes MONTREAL The unpropitious weather for the last three Saturdays has certainly not been conducive to outdoor sports; however, the Hunt is to be congratulated on the large attendance of its members each day, and despite the downpour on Saturday last, the turnout of mounts was the largest of the season, including for the first time four ladies, a fact we were glad to notice, for we had begun to wonder if the fair sex, who in years gone by used to grace the field, were to have no successors. The Meet, which was to have been at Summerhill, the country seat of Mr. Hickson, was changed to Cote des Neiges, on account of that gentleman's absence in England, and the Hunt are indebted to Mr. Baumgarten and Mr. Paton for a capital breakfast at Lumkins, under the charge of Messrs. Hall & Scott, whose names are a sufficient guarantee that everything was as it should be. When the horn sounded we recognized the following ready to start: Mrs. Blackwood, Mrs. B. Davis, Mrs. Brice, Miss Ogilvie, Mr. Crawford, Dr. Hings-ton, Mr. Baumgarten, Mr. Galarneau, Mr. A. Stuart, Mr. Stevenson, Mr. Hutchins, Mr. K. A. Whitehead, Mr. Gault, Mr. Strathey, Mr. Stephens, Mr. Staufield; those in carriages were Mr. Esdaile, Mr. H. Paton, Mr. and Mrs. Riley of Boston, Mrs. Hutchins, Mr. Wolfe, Capt. Milburn, Mr. B. Campbell, Mr. A. White of Quebec, Capt. Shepherd, A.D.C., Capt. Ritchie, S.S. Peruvian, Mr. Harper, Mr. Stick of Swansea, and Mr. Magniao of England, whom we learned was a master of a fine pack at home. The coverts below Snowdon's farm were tried, and soon not one, but it seemed, a litter of foxes were found. For three or four hours the hounds and riders were kept on the move from one covert to the other. Those on foot viewed the foxes several times crossing the small open between the coverts; in fact, so rank were """"the varmint"""" that an unfortunate skunk got mixed up and was earthed by the stopper. The proprietors in the neighbourhood ought to be much obliged to the Hunt for their visits, to rid them of the enemies of their hen roosts, instead of stopping some of the members, as they did on Saturday, and demanding money for the damage done to a few fences. The Hunt are always most willing to repay the farmers for any damage that may be done to their property. LATEST NEWS The Grand Jury on Saturday brought in a true bill against Guiteau.

Dominion News FROM OTTAWA An important enterprise is now under way which will replace the lost one of the Ohio Company, that for a year and a half past worked the Forsyth Iron Mines in Hull township. Mr. Lawless has leased lot No. 13, 7th concession of the township of Hull, to a company of American capitalists for a period of five years. The Lawless property lies adjacent to the Forsyth Baldwin mines, and the mine opened proves to be most rich and promising. Although papers were only signed yesterday, 10 tons of ore were taken out with the appliances at hand, under the superintendence of Captain Timmons, who was recently in the employ of the company which worked the Forsyth mine. New mining machinery has been ordered from New York, and work will be pushed forward during the winter. The company have agreed to pay 40c per ton royalty, with the privilege of buying the property, which comprises 100 acres, any time for $100,000. The ore will be sent to the States to be manufactured into pig iron. Mr. Blanchard of New York is President of the company, which has started the enterprise, and Dr. Carpenter of New Jersey, the Treasurer. The capitalists interested belong to New York, Jersey City and Boston. Mr. Hale, Engineer-in-Chief of the Canada Atlantic Railway, and the Duffy party will remain in this section a week or more. Three distinct lines will be run into this city from Hurdman bridge locality and the most feasible line adopted. A line will also be surveyed from the city station grounds to the Chaudiere, so that connection with the saw mills can be made, as the transport of lumber is one of the greatest objects for which the railway is being built. It is the purpose of intending contractors to examine the route of the Toronto & Ottawa Railway between Sharbot and Lake Madoc before tendering. A number are expected in the town shortly with that object. Work in Maberly goes briskly on. The contractors are now going through a heavy cut, and after that they will be engaged in a deep fill. The work seems to go on vigorously, and although the gang is small they intend to enlarge it as soon as they come to more sand excavating. There is a large number of men now clearing the right of way on the south side of the village. Tomorrow morning, Mr. Murray Mitchell, with a staff of three engineers and twelve men, leaves to survey the route of the proposed Gatineau Valley Railway between Hull and the Desert, about one hundred miles north of this city. This road will run through what was once thought to be a barren waste, but experiments have proved it to be not only very rich in phosphate and iron, but from an agricultural point of view. Work is now being done on four new lines centering at Ottawa, the New York, Waddington-Ottawa Railway, the Toronto & Ottawa Railway, the Canada & Atlantic, and Gatineau Valley Railway. Besides these projects, there will be Pontiac & Pacific Railway, or the extension of the Y.M.",

This was as high an honor as could be conferred by the society upon a Canadian. Last evening His Excellency the Governor-General presented a number of the workmen at Rideau Hall, including the police and employees of every description, with a New Year's gift. The recipients were summoned one by one and received the presents from the hands of the Marquis. The presents took the shape of fancy pipes, tobacco, clocks, etc. It is generally understood that Parliament will meet for the dispatch of business on the 25th of February.

The Deputy Minister of Marine is preparing a circular for distribution among the agents and others on the Atlantic coast, instructing them in the details of a scheme which is being perfected by the Prince of Monaco and the French admiralty, by which it is hoped to determine the direction and force of the Gulf Stream. It is proposed to have constructed a number of buoys, of iron or some such material, which will be launched at intervals in the Gulf Stream, and as they are likely to be washed ashore by the current and the action of the wind and sea, the Marine department's agents are instructed to be on the lookout for them, and to report each one found at once to the department. It is thought this scheme will furnish some valuable data upon a subject on which there is a wide divergence of opinion at present. When the lighthouse and fog signal at Cape Race, Nfld, pass into the hands of the Dominion Government on July 1, all light dues will be abolished. The Imperial Government, by whom the lighthouse is now controlled, has a surplus of $90,000 from the collection of past years, and this will be handed over to the Dominion authorities.

London, January 22. The Times' Mandalay correspondent says: A Burman, who was suspected of being connected with a conspiracy, was placed among the corpses of five Dacoits who had just been executed. The provost marshal then threatened the man with instant death by shooting if he did not confess all he knew of a supposed conspiracy in which certain Burmese ministers were alleged to be implicated. A squad of soldiers were drawn up in line and presented their rifles at the man. This frightened him into making a confession, in which he implicated several of the Burmese ministers. His testimony was written in a book borrowed from a newspaper correspondent and was taken to Mr. Bernard, the British chief commissioner, who, after learning the circumstances under which it had been given, indignantly declined to receive it. Col. Sladen, the British police inspector, has made a report of the affair to the chief military official. Advices from Mandalay say that Lord Dufferin has ordered the publication of a circular warning Europeans not to expose themselves either singly or in small parties. London, January 22. Lord Randolph Churchill, secretary for India, was asked in the House of Commons this evening what truth there was in the story of the cruel treatment of a Burman by British soldiers at Mandalay. He replied that he was unable to believe that the provost-marshal had been guilty of the monstrous and inhuman conduct charged against him. He said an immediate inquiry would be made, and if the story proved to be true, exemplary punishment would be meted out to the provost-marshal. VINCINC. Railway Generally Blocked and Delays in the Coldest Weather Ever Known. Marshaltown, Iowa, January 22. A blizzard struck this section at 2 o'clock this morning and everything is snowed in. The thermometer at 6 a.m. was 21 below zero. On the railroads the cuts are all filled and the snow is packed hard and solid. No trains can reach here for twenty-four or forty-eight hours. Des Moines, Iowa, January 22. The mercury here is 12 to 15 degrees below zero and it is still falling. The railroads are blockaded worse than at any previous time this winter. No trains on the Illinois Central here to Sioux City were moving. The snow blizzard and blockade, particularly on the western half of the road beyond Fort Dodge, was the most severe ever experienced. The passenger train which left Sioux City on Thursday evening was caught near Remsen in a drift, 3,000 feet long and 20 feet in depth. Its engines are """"dead"""" and no provisions for those on board the train are obtainable. The thermometer in that portion of the state is 23 to 25 below zero. Along the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul a passenger train and three freights are in the snow near Winona west of McGregor. Two passenger trains are blockaded at Calmar. A negro minstrel company is snowed in near Marcus, and are giving performances on the train. The snow has fallen to a considerable depth, but is very light in weight and has drifted easily. Buffalo, January 22. The thermometer has gone down to 12 above zero and is falling rapidly. The wind is blowing forty miles an hour and increasing in velocity. Sioux City, Iowa, January 22. The mercury here was 24 degrees below zero this morning. Trains on nearly all the roads are several hours behind, and the Illinois Central is still blockaded. Elkndale, Dakota, January 22.

The mercury this morning stood at 33 below zero. There is no wind. Trains were delayed but little by last evening's storm. St. Paul, Minnesota, January 22. The blizzard, which has been raging since last night, is the worst known among the railroads for years. In every direction it is very cold and blowing at a terrific rate, filling cuts and in the southern part of the country making it impossible to keep them clear long enough to run trains. Trains on the Southern Minnesota division of the Milwaukee road have been abandoned. It is 57 degrees below zero at St. Vincent. The Burlington and Northern is also badly blocked. Minneapolis, Minnesota, January 22. For suddenness and severity the present blizzard has no superior and few rivals within the memory of the oldest inhabitants. At sunrise this morning the mercury was 33 degrees lower than at 1 o'clock last night, or 23 degrees below zero. At 9 a.m. it reached its minimum, 28 below, and at noon it had returned, under the influence of the sun, to only 22 below, making the extreme for twenty-four hours ending at noon today 3 degrees. The protection afforded by the buildings of the town reduced the sensible force of the blizzard considerably, but a few farmers who fought their way in from the country reported the storm to be one of terrible severity. Chicago, January 22. Although no snow fell in the vicinity of Chicago today, the drifting of very fine snow was such as to make railroading very hard and to delay trains. The same state of affairs, from dispatches received by the railway mail service, exists in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, and the signal office predicts that tomorrow's mails from the West and Northwest will be from ten to fifteen hours late. The mercury at 11 p.m. was 10 to 12 below zero, and still falling. SWEEPED AWAY BY SNOW. Disastrous Results of Snow. Slides in Colorado Many Persons Killed. Denver, Colorado, January 22.

TORONTO SNOWSHOE CLUB. Practically the first tramp of the season of the Toronto Snowshoe Club took place last evening. The members were out on what proved to be such hard going to make snow-shoeing a mockery. Last night the boys had a rattling time. There was a large muster, the gun in the park being the rallying place. From the ex-Russian artillery piece Archie McKinnon, the leader, showed the way over to Rosendale and thence to Eglinton. The snow was rather soft, making the tramping somewhat heavy. From Eglinton, after resting at John Gilcott's, the boys snowshoed it back again, arriving downtown all aglow, but yet apparently able to recover the distance if time had permitted. George, the secretary member of the club, was whipper-in. WORLD SKATING. Say the Ottawa Citizen, The Frontenac Snowshoe Club will be four years old tomorrow, having been established on January 22nd, 1882. Tonight the club will tramp to Gatineau Point, where the anniversary will be celebrated by a supper. The start will be made at 8 o'clock from the club hall corner of York and Dalhousie streets. THE HUDSON YACHTS. A Poughkeepsie despatch says: The race for the Challenge pennant of America is the next great ice yachting event on the Hudson. It may be sailed any day within the week if the weather should turn out favorable. The first contest for the flag took place March 6, 1881, competing yachts being the Magic, Phantom, Snow Flake, Halcyon, Zephyr, Sophia, Flyaway and Meteor, of the New Hamburg Club, and the Bolus, Avalanche and Oracle, of the Poughkeepsie Club. It was a very unsatisfactory race, a sort of push and sail contest, the Phantom winning over the twenty-mile course in 67 minutes. On February 6, 1883, the pennant was raced for again and was won by the Avalanche, of the Poughkeepsie Club in 57 minutes. The boats of the Shrewsbury Club came up the Hudson to compete for the trophy in 1884 and the race was sailed on February 10. The Haze, of the Poughkeepsie Club, won in 1h 8m 30s. The last time the flag was raced for was on February 10, 1885, the New Hamburg Club having challenged the Poughkeepsie Club for it, and sending to the starting point the yachts Quickstep, Whiff, Whistler, Phantom, Zero, Zephyr, and Mischief. The Poughkeepsie yachts defending the flag in this race were the Haze, Avalanche, Icicle, Northern Light, Jack Frost, Grade and Jessie B. The Zero fouled on her first trip up the river. The Haze won, and after the race the sailing master of one or two of the New Hamburg boats put in a claim of foul against the Haze, as also did the master of the Jack Frost. The Regatta committee disallowed the claim and awarded the prize to the Haze, which resulted in the rupture of the Poughkeepsie Club, out of which grew the Hudson River Ice Yacht Club, which now has fifty-seven members and owns twenty-six first-class yachts. The coming race for the ice yachts' challenge pennant of America will be between boats of the Poughkeepsie Club and those of the Hudson River Ice Yacht Club, the latter having formally challenged the Poughkeepsie Club. The Hudson River Ice Yacht Club has also challenged the Poughkeepsie Club to sail for the Poughkeepsie challenge pennant, the next prize of importance, which was presented to the club in 1872 by General W. Kid I, of New York. The challenge has been accepted. A MATCH FROM IRELAND. There is a man in Nevada named Angelo Catelli, who claims to be the strongest in the world. He is part Italian, aged 31, and stands five feet ten inches, weighing 275 pounds. His spinal column is double the ordinary width, and his bones and joints are unusually large and genuine. He has lifted a man of 250 pounds with his middle finger of his right hand. The man stood with one foot on the floor, his arm outstretched, his hand grasped by two prods to sustain his body. Catelli stooped down and pierced the third finger of his right hand under the man's foot, and with steady perseverance raised him to the height of four feet and deposited him on a table near at hand.

The Courtney-Ross programme has been temporarily broken up by the serious illness of the Union Springs sculler, who took a bad cold at Lockport on Monday. Their last appearance with Courtney's new rowing machines was at Auburn last evening Ross and Courtney rowed a two-mile race, Courtney winning. The latter was so sick that he was obliged to go to his home in Union Springs. Ross came to this city. Their manager says that Courtney is a very sick man and cannot resume work for several weeks. They will carry out their engagements at present by putting the pedestrian Hoagland against Ross. They have telegraphed to Teemer and Plaisted to get one of them to substitute for Courtney. MIXED ITEMS. The Caledonian curling club of Buffalo will play a match in Toronto on Wednesday next with the Toronto curling club. Four rinks of Toronto curlers played a match at Brentford yesterday with the local curlers, the Torontonians winning by 10 points. Under date of January 20, Mr. J. I. Case writes from Racine: """"Ed is giving Jay-eye-see and Phallas gentle exercise in the snow, and they seem as sound and smooth as they did before being put on the track. I intend to put Jay-eye-see in training when spring opens, and hope to see him lower the magnificent record of Maud S. Phallas will be in the stud at Hickory Grove, Racine."""" THE LIBERAL CHRISTIAN UNION. Lecture on """"Socrates"""" by Rev. Mr. Williamson Last Evening. Last evening the first of the series of lectures under the auspices of the Liberal Christian Union was delivered by the Rev. John Williamson in the Church of the Messiah. The subject chosen by the lecturer was a discourse on """"Socrates."""" Mr. Alexander Manson occupied the chair, and there was a large audience. The rev. gentleman, after referring to the life of the great philosopher, concluded as follows: All classes of citizens felt the power of a mind that unmasked their hypocrisy and exposed the half-truths which they held as whole truths, and the miserable prejudices which in their sublime conceit they mistook for knowledge. Socrates, however, was more than this. Although he left no system of philosophy, like his illustrious disciple Plato, his work was more than critical. He made havoc with ideas which had never been passed through the fire of the mind and formed into a man's moral and spiritual nature. But it was with the further aim of having what elements of truth they contained reset in a higher form. Socrates was a great doubter in order that he might become a great believer. He was the first to attempt to get behind the vague general terms and hypotheses that were afloat regarding good and evil, justice and injustice, right and wrong, etc., to the principles beneath them. In an especial sense he was the first philosopher; he attempted to bring men from the dim, uncertain light of the ordinary uncritical thought, into the strong, steady light of a clear self-consciousness. Life, he said, was a whole. There was an end to be realized, though he did not clearly define what that end was. Hence """"Virtue is knowledge;"""" the only virtuous life was that not guided by the impulse of the moment, but by one well-defined principle, which as an end it would seek to realize, and which would give it unity and completeness. The result of his teaching to himself was inevitably accusation, trial, death. The charges against him were trumped up for the occasion. He had been laying up for himself a store of angry feeling which would some day recoil upon his head, and he was bound to become a martyr to the bigotry and intolerance he denounced. That he was innocent was beyond question. Socrates had studiously observed the current religious forms. To his master mind the symbols of the popular faith were, no doubt, instinct with a life and meaning which the common eye had not seen, and pointed to a far-off transcendent reality which they attempted dimly to shadow forth. Yet it was wholly untrue that he neglected the gods of the city and introduced new ones of his own. The second charge was equally false. Through his influence, young men would, doubtless, come to think differently from their fathers, but it was a baseless calumny to charge him with being a corruptor of Athenian youth. In the development of Greek thought, Socrates exercised a profound influence. He was a center of intellectual life and activity, and, through Plato and the school of philosophy that followed him, his influence had become a permanent factor in shaping the thought and life of the world. A Carlyle had well said: """"The great man is always lightning out of heaven; the rest of men mustered for him like cattle, and then they, too, would shine."""" Socrates was a leader for the truth, and his life in this respect had a universal bearing. In life was his philosophy. More than that of any system was the influence of a man's life, when the energies of his nature had been transmuted into action, and produced a vital force in the great life of the world. Systems rose, grew old, decayed and perished with the ever rushing tide of life and thought, but the spiritual force of a great life never died. It was so with Socrates. D. Parker, Miss Mercer, Miss De Witt, Miss Warren. Medical adviser Dr. Molson. Solicitor Mr. Leo H. Davidson. The meeting then adjourned. DEATH OF A PIONEER. An old Northwest pioneer, Mr. John Glenn, has just passed over to the majority. He was a native of Ireland and entered the Northwest from British Columbia in 1871 and was the oldest settler in the territory. Mr. Glenn's farm at Fish Creek was a model one. The Marquis of Lorne and other distinguished visitors to the Northwest were always taken to see John Glenn's homestead. The deceased was 64 years old and leaves a wife and five children. THE INTEREST OF THE FARMERS. The following interesting letter, exposing the business methods of the secretary of the Farmers' Union of Manitoba, appears in the Winnipeg Free Press of Monday: """"Sir, I understand the annual business meeting of the Farmers' Union is to be held next week in Winnipeg, and I ask your permission to publicly state what I consider gross mismanagement on the part of Mr. Purvis. The facts are these: In the month of September I met Mr. Purvis in Brandon, and told him I had a quantity of wheat for sale. I showed him a sample of it, and, after some conversation, arranged to consign a carload to him. He told me he thought it would realize about 62 cents. On my return to Alexander, Mr. Billiard, a grain buyer from Ontario, offered me sixty-five cents for the carload. As there was some uncertainty as to the exact price Mr. Purvis would give me, I immediately wired to him that I was offered sixty-five cents at Alexander, saying that if he could not do better I would sell at Alexander. His reply was: """"Disposed to pay higher than anybody. Ship as arranged, you will find it satisfactory."""" Writing, """"As a member of the Farmers' Union wishing to support its work, and having confidence in Mr. Purvis, I decided to transact my business through the union. It is now more than three months since I shipped my wheat, and though during that time I have written repeatedly to Mr. Purvis pressing for information regarding the disposal of this wheat, he has not deigned to reply. To say the least I consider this most extraordinary conduct for one holding the position Mr. Purvis does. Through the treasurer of the union, Dr. Fleming, I have drawn $100 on the wheat. Within the last few days I learn from Dr. Fleming that Mr. Purvis can only pay me 50 cents in final settlement, which means a clear loss to me of 14 cents per bushel on a carload of 1,000 bushels, or about $90. In the light of the telegram I received from Mr. Purvis, and considering I cannot get any information from him, the transaction appears to me to be a deliberate fraud. For my own sake and the sake of others, I ask you to give publicity to this letter. It may elicit information. I am a member of the Farmers' Union, and wish it every success, but I protest against such collusive transactions as these being carried on in its name."""" John F. Hiesl, Haluton Farm, Alexander Station, Man., January 10, 1888. THE WEATHER. Toronto, Ont., January 23, 1888.

Interesting Sketch of the Banquet at the St. George's Club. London, January 6. Londoners have had this week a rare spectacle, an event to be met with only once in a blue moon or so. Not since 1881 have we had such a downfall of snow and even then it remained so long with us in the present instance. The consequence in the let in the town has been covered for only a few inches and our many vestries and public bodies are at once thrown into a state of great excitement and confusion in their attempts to deal with the unwelcome visitor. What has happened this week happened in 1881, and will be again whenever snow next visits us. The snowfall having ceased, our local governors, in their respective districts, sent out a few small boys with brooms and pans and a few carts and by a gigantic effort the snow, which has by this time been a brown dirty slush, is cleared from the middle of some of the principal roads and heaped up on each side. Thus ends the first day in misery alike to those driving and a king. Then comes a frost and the streets become a kind of pea soup and crossing a road is like fording a swampy bog, like in the old days crossing the Wandsworth Main street, where the mud is thickest. The second day brings with it a slow thaw best. And thus the third morning dawns and the streets become mere slimy ponds from which the soupy substance is exuded upon the passers-by as each vehicle ploughs its way along. Meanwhile the ever active officials cause what once was snow to be carted in a leisurely way from the mounds to the river, and thus after three or four days' continuous labor, a few only of the principal streets are made just fit to walk in, the rest and nearly the whole of the great part of London outside the city boundaries remaining in a state of indescribable filth. And this is London, supposed by other than tourists to be the very heart of civilization. Surely if aught were needed to show the utter absurdity of our present system of metropolitan government, the experience of the past few days has amply supplied that want. One thing is certain, the sooner we get rid of these meddling little vestries and petty vestrymen and place all London under one supreme control the better it will be for all concerned.

Odd of the candidates for practice was plucked for having endeavored to play an exceedingly well-conceived trick by which he expected to be placed in possession of the answers to the set of questions. As soon as the papers in the various branches upon which he was to be examined had been placed before him, he hastily copied them on a sheet of paper, took an apple from his pocket, and cutting out the core, he introduced the paper into the fruit. He then coolly opened the window, apparently for the purpose of obtaining fresh air, and threw the apple with the questions to a young member of the bar outside, the intention being to have it returned with the answers. Unfortunately, the trick was detected, and the candidate who had perpetrated it was consequently plucked. The snowstorm was one of the severest experienced for some years. The delay to the trains. The snowstorm which commenced on Thursday night and continued without intermission all day yesterday had the effect of delaying trains in all directions. No information could be gleaned from the officials at the Bonaventure depot, but the following appeared on the blackboard: No. 1, West, due at 8:30 p.m., 1 hour and 15 minutes late; No. 7, Ottawa, due at 11:30 a.m., 9 hours and 30 minutes late; No. 10, C.V.R., 8:40 p.m., 2 hours late; South Eastern, due at 8:30 p.m., 2 hours late; No. 4, East, due at 8:12 p.m., cancelled. So far, this winter has been exceptionally hard as far as snowstorms are concerned. Yesterday's snowstorm was declared to be the heaviest of the season, and the railway officials fear that traffic will be seriously impeded. At an early hour, the storm had not caused much delay to the service, but as the snow fell steadily the whole day and evening, accompanied by a blizzard in the country, there is every likelihood of a block occurring. The number of farmers who arrived in the city yesterday was small, notwithstanding that it was market day. The few who did face the terrific storm complain bitterly of the trouble experienced in reaching the city, owing to the heavy roads and blinding storm, and state that it is the worst they have been subjected to for several years past. The storm evidently prevailed throughout the whole province. Dr. de Jongh's Light Brown Cod Liver Oil. In consumption, its efficacy is unequalled.

Hitkpre- 482½ II 4JAKAU4N NM'lfHITIKN IUKIN THE PAST YEAR. For the first time since this Journal was established now nearly four years, the financial retrospect usual at this season yields almost unalloyed satisfaction. A comparison with this time last year shows that, with rare exceptions, pre-existing securities have advanced in value in some cases very considerably and there has been, we are glad to say, no fresh instance of default or disgrace. As compared with what could be said of Australia or South America, but little new work has, however, been done. No Government issue of any kind has been made: Dominion, Provincial, or municipal. On account of railway companies, the principal operation was the issue in April last of the balance of the Canadian Pacific railway bonds. That company's Manitoba Southwestern bonds have also been placed this year, chiefly, however, in Amsterdam. The Manitoba and Northwestern Railway company have also got their bonds into the market. The Island of Anticosti company has been floated during the year, and bonds have been issued on behalf of the City of Winnipeg Water Works company and the Halifax Graving Dock company. The three defaulting railway companies are practically as they were a year ago. The Montreal and Sorel bonds issued in April 1883 at 97 are now quoted 12 to 16, and are probably worth nothing at all, except as voting counters. Quebec Central are considered to have some prospects, and they are quoted 29 to 32, which is 3 higher than the price of a year ago. Newfoundland railway bonds are quoted 40 to 46, and may be dealt in at that, for, though interest is in default, there is every prospect, we think, of sooner or later some settlement being come to with the Newfoundland Government. If the committee of bondholders are willing to deal fairly with the Government, who, it should be borne in mind, have been greatly injured under the concession, they may at any time, we believe, get equitable terms. As to the improved market value of Canadian securities known in Great Britain, there is much to be said. Dominion 3½ per cents are as much as 6 higher, having risen from 92¼ to 98¼. Provincial Government bonds have as a rule improved, but the older 6 per cents are naturally inclined to lose some of their considerable premiums, as the redemption dates come to be thought more of. Of municipal bonds, those of Quebec and Toronto show a rise of about 3 percent, but Toronto's credit is a long way ahead of that of any other Canadian city. But the most considerable advance is in railway securities. All those which have any pretension to soundness have risen considerably. Canadian Pacific shares were 60 a year ago, and they have recently been above 75, but are now just under 70. The company's bonds, in spite of the large addition to the amount on the market, have risen from 102¼ to 107, and they changed hands at 108 a week or two ago. The Grand Trunk series have advanced to a still larger extent. The guaranteed stock, which was 56, is now 74; the first preference has advanced from 5 to 76½, and the second preference from 38 to 58. The bonds of the various lines leased to both these great companies have correspondingly improved. The minor companies also show great progress in some cases. New Brunswick railway bonds have risen from 82 to 98, Northern of Canada third preference bonds from 82 to 96, and Windsor and Annapolis B debenture stock from 62 to 100. St. John and Maine shares have been as high as 46, but they are now not much over 30. In the other sections, there has also been some improvement. Bank of British Columbia shares have risen from 26 to 28; Bank of British North America shares, which were 60, are now 68; and Bank of Montreal shares, which, with $200 paid, closed last year at $100, are now $181. Loan shares are better than they were a year ago, Trust and Loan shares, however, being still at a slight discount. Land shares have, as a rule, improved; but there has recently been a reaction from the unduly high price of Hudson's Bay shares of a month or two ago. There is practically nothing to say of the other sections of our Canadian investments. London Canadian Gazette, COTTON MARKETS. LIVERPOOL, January 14. Cotton quiet; uplands, 6d; Orleans, 6d.

OAXTTOFPIN, Friday Evening. European Breach in the character of the cable advices, but the tendency seemed to be toward improvement. Cargoes of wheat on passage or for shipment were steadier. Red winter off coast was at 36s 6d, No. 1 California 37s 3d, California just shipped at 38s 3d and California nearly due at 37s 3d. In Liverpool, wheat was steady, with red American spring limited at 7s 4d-7s 5d. Corn was 1d lower, at 6s 8d and Canadian peas unchanged at 6s 8d. At Mark Lane, wheat and corn were quiet and flour steadier. First bakers' flour was at 26s 0d. The London Wheat and Flour Circular, of December 11, says: The weather since our last has been severe. On Sunday there was a storm of wind and snow, and the country now is generally buried in many places to some considerable depth, especially in the south and east. The temperature has been mild since, so that, although the snow remains, a great deal of it has melted and the ground is accordingly very much sodden. A heavy fall of snow is at all times welcomed from an agricultural point of view, as it acts as a fertilizer and at the same time a covering to vegetable life against frost. So much of the time since our last review of the corn trade has been taken up with the Christmas holidays that there is little to chronicle except the very marked fact that, despite the period of the year, which is always one of dullness, the firmness of the trade continues and the advance in value still goes on. During the whole of the past year, business in the corn trade has been of the most wretchedly inert description, values generally keeping much on the same par, declining gradually in the first few months, then recovering themselves until about harvest time, after which they dropped again, when in the latter part of November they commenced to mend, and have gone on improving until there is fully an advance of 6s to 10s from the lowest point, if not more. Fluent qualities of English wheat, which were selling at 34s-36s, are now fetching 40s-42s, and the improvement in Australian and Indian descriptions is fully 11s much. The first cause of this advance was no doubt the scarcity of English wheat, country millers as well as the various town mills finding it difficult to supply their requirements even on the spot, and at the same time the importations of American flour have not continued on the same scale as they were. This has caused some considerable demand on our stocks of wheat and flour, which have become much reduced from what they were. The movement thus set going has no doubt been helped by the dread of foreign political complications, and we find ourselves with the conviction that the price of wheat was unwarrantably low, while we have only India and America to look to for supplies, and are sure to have France as a competitor for them. DULUTH MARKETS. The grain markets in Chicago were worse and ruled lower. Wheat was weak and declined 1c, closing at 78c February, 79c March, 85c May. Corn eased off 1¼c, closing at 36c February, 37c March, 41c May. Oats closed at 20c February, 21c March, 30c May. Today's inspection was 23 cars winter wheat, 48 spring, 270 corn and 124 oats. At the seaboard, wheat was weaker and declined 1c-2c, closing at 91c January, 92¼c February, 93c March, 95¼c April, 96¼c May. Corn fell off 1c, closing at 47c January, 48c February, 49c March, 60c April, 60c May. Oats closed at 35c January, 38¼c February, 35c March, 36c April, 30c May. Ocean freights to Liverpool by steam were at 4d per bushel. The Toledo wheat market was about steady. No. 2 red closing at 81c cash, 81¼c January, 84c February, 86¼c March, 89c May. Corn was unchanged, closing at 87c cash, 42c May. Oats were higher at 27¼c cash. At Detroit, wheat was stronger and advanced 1c, No. 1 white closing at 83c cash. In Milwaukee, wheat declined 1c, closing at 76c cash, 78c February, 84c May. Maclver & Barclay, 120 St. Francois Xavier street, report the Chicago markets today as follows: Wheat- Feb. 4.00$1.60 and buckwheat, at $1.00 per bag. In vegetables, business was fairly active at former quotations. Potatoes brought a dime per bag, lemons at $1.00 per box, turnips fine per bag, celery 10c per dozen, plums 10c per bushel, sweet potatoes $1 per barrel, and rhubarb 50c per bunch. For fruit, there was a fair inquiry at unchanged prices. Apples sold at $3.00 per barrel, lemons at $3.00 per box, cranberries at 4½c-5½c per gallon, bananas at $7.00-8.00 per barrel, and pineapples at 50c each. Dairy produce was in light supply, for which there was a good inquiry at former values. There was an active demand for poultry and game, the offerings of both being large at quotations. Fowls sold at $1.00 each, ducks at $1.10-$1.20, geese at 70c-85c each, and cock turkeys at $1.00-$1.60 each. In game, black ducks brought $1.00-$1.50 per pair, bluebill ducks 45c-$1.00, plover $3.50-$4.00 per dozen, partridges 60c-65c per pair, and snowbirds 30c-35c per dozen. There was a large supply of fish offered, which met with a brisk demand at steady prices. THE TRAMPS TODAY. The track to Lachine will be very heavy for the St. George Snowshoe green steeplechase runners, the only point in their favor being the fact that the Montrealers will start half an hour ahead and make some kind of a road for them to travel over. The Montrealers start from the gymnasium sharp at 3 o'clock, and it is to be hoped a good gathering will be there when the president gives the word. St. George tramp off half an hour later. They also want a big muster. OTHER TRAMPS LAST NIGHT. Fifteen members of the Artillery club tramped over the mountain in the heavy snow last night and fully enjoyed their pleasant time at Donahue's after their very hard work. Next Friday will be ladies' night and is sure to be a success. On the following Friday, the annual green steeplechase will be run. Notwithstanding the stormy weather, some twenty-five members of the Prince of Wales Snowshoe club tramped out to the Athletic club house last night, where an enjoyable time was spent. The Argyle Snowshoe club held their ladies' night last evening, when about sixty couples were present. To state that a pleasant time was spent goes without saying. THE OLD TOGGER BLADES. The """"vets"""" will muster at the Gym at 3 o'clock sharp, for the tramp to Lachine. About seventy-five are expected to sit down to dinner at Harvie's. SOCIETY. MISCELLANEOUS. The new slide of the Guelph Snowshoe and Toboggan club was opened in good style on Monday night. The Ottawa Cricket club has written to Daft, Nottingham, Eng., to get a man of first-class abilities as coach. Harry McKeona, the billiardist, has been playing straight rail, three-ball billiards, 500 or nothing, in Boston. There is to be a pigeon shooting match at St. Catharines on January 19, at which $200 will be offered in prizes. Thirty members of the Sportsmen's association, Pittsburg, Pa., have leased 60,000 acres near Winchester, W. Va., for sporting purposes. John Black, Jr., of Fergus, wants to skate any man in Ontario a five-mile race for $100 a side. Black left a good deal of money in Montreal once when thinking he was a skater. Decker, the champion collar and elbow wrestler of America, arrived in town yesterday and is making Carney's his headquarters. He will give exhibitions nightly with Carney, and is well worth seeing. Among the players now before the public who were members of league teams in 1876 may be mentioned: A. H. Harbridge. A man named Fitzpatrick wants to jump any man in the following series: One and three standing jumps, standing and running high jumps, standing back jump, standing hop, step and jump, with weights, and standing high jump without weights, and a high kick. The match is to be for any part of $200. TORONTO TOWN TOPICS. A Warehouse Flooded-Board of Trade Officers-The Ontario Creamery Association. Toronto, January 14. Owing to the carelessness of the engineer to turn the feed off the boiler last night, the wholesale dry goods warehouse of Simpson & Co., corner of Yonge and Mclihda streets, was found to be flooded this morning, the water being on each floor to a depth of several inches. The damage to the stock is estimated at $20,000, for which no compensation can be obtained. Some of the ceilings are also badly damaged, and are likely to give way. The firm has only recently taken possession of the premises. A meeting of the directors of the Ontario Creamery association was held here this afternoon. There was a fair attendance, but several were unable to be present owing to the snow blockade on the railways. By-laws were adopted and it was decided to hold the annual convention in this city, on February 16th and 17th, when several important papers will be read. With a view to more rapidly introducing the creamery system and raising the standard of butter, the following gentlemen were appointed to deliver lectures wherever farmers desire their assistance: D. Derbyshire and John Spragge, east, and M. Moyer and George Drowning, west of Toronto. A special meeting of the Board of Trade was held this afternoon to receive nominations for officers for the ensuing year. There was a very large attendance of members. William Lee, of Perkins, Line & Co., wholesale grocers, was unanimously elected president, and W. M. Russ was re-elected treasurer. Nominations were made for the council, board of arbitration, harbor commission and industrial exhibition association. The officers contested will be balloted for at the annual meeting next Friday. Notice of motion was given that Mr. Darling, the retiring president, be made a life member of the board in recognition of his invaluable service. THE CZAR'S GOVERNMENT MAKES PROPOSALS TO SETTLE THE BULGARIAN DIFFICULTY. Vienna, January 11. The most recent proposals Russia has collected for the settlement of the Bulgarian difficulty were made by Count Peter Schouvaloff at Berlin. In these, Russia maintained the candidacy of Prince Nicholas of Montenegro for the Bulgarian throne, provided that the Prince's well-known demands on the regency be generally supported. Negotiations are now proceeding on the basis of these proposals. The Continental powers are disposed to accede to Russia's proposals, and it is said that England is also desirous that a general understanding should be reached. NOTE TO OUR READERS. Followed by clearing, colder weather. Effect of the greatest snowstorm for years on the railways. Toronto, Ont., January 14, 1 a.m. The depression over Indiana yesterday is now central over Ontario. It has caused a general snowfall, turning to sleet and rain in the southern portion of the Lake region, and is now causing snow throughout the St. Lawrence. Owing to another depression now forming off the Atlantic coast, a snowstorm is prevailing in the Maritime provinces with strong winds and gales. The storm signals ordered for Maritime ports yesterday morning will be continued. St. Lawrence: Cloudy with snow followed by clearing weather; higher followed by lower temperature. A GREAT SNOWSTORM. Yesterday's snowstorm was the heaviest for many years, the amount registered at McGill observatory up to 11 p.m. being over twelve inches. This naturally had a disastrous effect on the punctuality of trains from all over the country, particularly to the west, dispatches bringing word of delays of from three to twenty hours, many trains in Western Canada, especially the locals, being cancelled. The country roads in the majority of cases are completely impassable, and it will take several days to get them into good condition again. Several freight and one or two passenger trains are reported stuck in drifts on the Grand Trunk railway and Canadian Pacific railway lines in Ontario. The Grand Trunk mail train which left Montreal at 9 p.m. on Thursday only reached Belleville at 12:30 p.m. yesterday, and the Canadian Pacific railway train, due at Ottawa at 4:48 a.m., only reached the Capitol at noon. Sir John Macdonald and Hon. Thus. While were passengers by it. The snow was so deep on the London, Huron & Bruce that the snow ploughs stuck and traffic was stopped. The Great Western division was open from Niagara to Detroit, but the Chicago Grand Trunk was badly blocked. A dispatch from Toronto at midnight said: The Grand Trunk line to the East has been cleared and the train for Montreal was dispatched in two portions, the first at 8 o'clock, the second after arrival of the first train from Detroit at 9:30. The train from Montreal due at 10:40 tonight is running over three hours late and is losing time. The Canadian Pacific railway train from Montreal this evening was cancelled and a special run from Havelock. Midland trains running to the main line at Port Hope were one hour late. The Hamilton branch was obstructed by snowdrifts and trains were considerably delayed. The express from Sarnia this morning was seven hours late. The western section of the Canadian Pacific railway is open and trains from Owen Sound and the Southern division are running on time. Snowploughs have been run in front of all the trains. The storm has been the heaviest known here for years and still continues. 382 -S 2 90 Overcast NE 82 7 00 10 mill -2 5 00 Snowing. Winnipeg, January 14. Mr. Stewart Mulvey, first vice-president of the Winnipeg Conservative association, has decided to contest Selkirk in the forthcoming Dominion elections. Both the old and young Liberal associations are holding a meeting tonight to decide on a candidate for Winnipeg. LA PRAIRIE COUNTY. A Conservative meeting for the county of La Prairie was to take place on Monday, but owing to the snowstorm which has rendered the roads almost impassable, it has been resolved to postpone the meeting till Wednesday, the 16th inst., at 11 o'clock in the forenoon. The meeting will be presided over by Mr. Pinsonneault, M.P., and will be addressed by Mr. Traft, M.H., P. Pampanon, J. Dolathionner, U. Berthelet and A. Du'lointreux. A Good Samaritan. As Mr. Nicholson, milk dealer of Lachine, was driving into the city yesterday morning, he found a young woman scantily dressed lying in the snow in an unconscious state on the bank of the canal. She was removed to an adjoining house where it was found that parts of her body were frozen. Every attention was paid her, and she is now in a fair way of recovery. CHOWAN OMOA STATISTICS. Mr. Chan Dfkii, of the office of the Crown and Peace, has just completed the statistics of his department for the past year. The table shows that $3,001.32 were paid in fines, $6,187.70 in peace fees, $1,220 in crown fees, and $3,211.20 in building taxes. These figures form a total of $13,620.42, showing a surplus of $376.45 over the receipts of 1892. Board of Health. A meeting of the Board of Health was called for yesterday afternoon, but the only members present were the chairman (Aid. Gray) and Aid. White, and the meeting had to be postponed. The principal business was to purchase eight tons of coal for St. Roch's and to consider the petition for compensation for the removal of Linker's glue factory outside the city limit. The HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. The Montreal Horticultural Society and Fruit Growers' Association for the province of Quebec will hold its annual meeting for the discussion of fruits, at Granby, P.Q., on Tuesday evening next. The meeting promises to be a very interesting one. Return tickets can be obtained at one and a third first class single fare at the Central Vermont Railway office, St. Paul's.",

Allan, Murray, Torrance and other shipping firms, are moving in the matter of obtaining an increase of the Harbour Police, and a memorial to that effect will be prepared and forwarded at an early date to the Minister of Marine. The merchants claim that there is an evident necessity for increased protection this year, as, aside from the announced intention of the ship laborers to hold out for higher wages and their determination not to give in to their demands, which may result in trouble, the accommodation of the harbour is being increased and the force at its present strength is not adequate to the protection of the shipping along the extended line of wharves. Trains Delayed. The heavy snowstorms of the last day or two have seriously impeded the train service, and most of the trains have been greatly delayed. The Western yesterday morning was six hours late, and the New York trains on the Vermont Central and Delaware & Hudson, about three hours. The Ottawa train on the Canada Atlantic, due at 8:55 on Monday evening, did not arrive until 8 o'clock yesterday morning. The North Shore line was reported clear last night, and the service will be on time today. The trains arriving last night were not so much delayed. The Western train was two hours late, and the Canada Atlantic one hour. The South Eastern and the English mail train had not arrived at two o'clock this morning. A Tremendous Excursion. One of the most delightful excursions ever organized has just been arranged by Messrs. Leve Aman, the oldest established and most reliable tourist agents in the United States, who have their branch offices in all principal places. The growing popularity of a trip to California and a desire to visit the attractive points in Colorado have prompted this firm to arrange an excursion accordingly, and they being ever alive to the wants of the public will certainly give satisfaction. It consists of a spring visit to San Francisco via New Orleans, through Texas, Mexico, New Mexico and Southern California. The excursionists will have the privilege of traveling singly to New Orleans, from which point the grand excursion will start on April 18th, under the care of Mr. W. Campbell, of Quebec, and Colonel Turnbull, of the Canadian service, also well known in England. These gentlemen have applied for and obtained a charter from the Canadian Government as the """"Military Colonization Company of Canada,"""" in order that, if necessary, in the future they can extend their operations beyond the territory they have now acquired. This territory has its northern boundary six miles south of latitude 51 and the western boundary is six miles south of longitude 114. Much of its southern portion near the Bow River is wooded; the remainder is in soil grasses, the climate is admirably suited for grazing, and the valley lands of the river for agriculture. The beautiful Bow River, watering the whole tract, is fed from the perpetual snow of the summits of the Rocky Mountains; the hotter the beats of summer the more abundant the supply of water. There is plenty of evidence that the land has been clear of snow all this winter, the warmest ever known over the northern parts of America. The winter temperature is modified by the prevailing warm winds from the Pacific Ocean, locally termed Chinook. There is an abundance of good coal in the vicinity, and the Canadian Pacific Railway will within two years pass along the northern limit of the property within a distance of six miles. The Indian reserve in the neighborhood is an advantage, as they are tractable and are already supplying cheap labor on a near Government farm. The Government of Canada knows how to treat the Queen's Indian subjects; these are not left to the mercies of rapacious dealers in rum and whiskey as in many parts of the United States, where they are permitted to be plied with drink for which they pawn all except what enables them to plunder for more. Then comes punishment from the American authorities, followed by revenge from the savages with horrible atrocities. There is nothing of this allowed in Canada. The Northwest Mounted Police, a select body of cavalry which might pass anywhere as red jackets, watch over the Indians and their source of temptation and evil drink. These fine soldiers are dressed in scarlet, so that all the Indians may know they are the soldiers of their great mother, the Queen of England. The lance and its flag can be seen a long way off; thus the quick-eyed Indian discovers one of the Queen's soldiers miles away, and the power and authority of that single soldier are known and felt throughout the district. One glimpse of him tells the vile whiskey dealer, with his schemes, James Barron, found guilty of carrying a revolver, was then called to the dock to receive sentence. His Honor said he had communicated with the American Consul about him, and had come to the conclusion that the imprisonment he had already suffered was adequate to the offense. I would accordingly discharge him, but the revolver would be confiscated. The Court was then adjourned till 11 o'clock today. A good adage taught their daughter that a stitch in time saves nine. A pill saves not only nine, but oftentimes an incalculable amount of suffering as well. An occasional dose of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant (Little Sugar-coated pills), to cleanse the stomach and bowels, not only prevents before it happens but also stops sudden attacks, when taken in time. By drugging, shambling truck, that the game is up and that he must hasten back across the frontier to avoid arrest and imprisonment for bringing drink to the Indians. The officers of the force are picked men, gifted with the right hand under the glove of velvet; it is an ennobling thought that the tame fury of governing savages should be admirably set forth at the opposite ends of the world by our officers, as is shown by their management of the wild Afghan border tribes along the Northwest frontier of our Eastern Empire, as well as the peaceable government of savage Indian tribes along the Northwest frontier of our Western Empire. The key to this success lies in the independent position of these officers. They have a certain work to do and are actuated by feelings of justice and honor, backed by the unlimited power of the Government. These qualities are those best understood by savages, though they do not practice them. We cannot in justice to American officers avoid saying that if they were treated by their Government as we treat our officers, with regard to influence and power, they would doubtless also bring their Indians into a corresponding state of repose; but American officers have not a fair chance. Major General Hango and his friends appear to have made a fair start. He writes with regard to his undertaking: """"Half the stock is taken up and 25 percent paid in, and I shall be glad to have more. I believe there are very few young fellows with little capital who will lose it on this continent in all sorts of swindles and mad schemes. Cattle raising is slow but steady. I would not wish to be the means of inducing old officers to take to such a life; but young fellows with capital who join me will, I believe, do well. Young men without capital - say $1,000 to invest had better not try cattle-raising, or come out at all. They would have no future beyond $30 or $40 a month orders. I have thought over this matter for some time and have traveled some 5,000 miles to see for myself. Why should I recommend young fellows to farm? Because this location is wasted and they can be beaten by any immigrant without a cent. Looking after cattle is not hard grinding labor; it is a hard life, requiring pluck, a minimum, and brains.

Qristc, March 20. In the Private Bills this morning consideration of the Montreal bill was postponed until tomorrow, owing to the non-arrival of an important deputation, known to be on board the delayed North Shore train. There were no meetings of the Committees on Privileges and Elections, Railways and Public Accounts, owing to the absence of quorum in consequence of the late hour at which the House adjourned this morning. Seven or eight witnesses, summoned from Montmagny, were, however, in attendance on the first-named committee to give evidence in the petition matter, the investigation into which was adjourned until tomorrow. Owing to the snowstorm, Crown Lands Commissioner Lynch was only able to leave this morning for Knowlton to attend his father's funeral. The Premier intends to move a resolution respecting the employment of official stenographers. He has also given notice of certain resolutions respecting railways. The possibility of proroguing this week is no longer in question, the Premier virtually admitting, towards the close of tonight's sitting, that the necessities of business still before the House might necessitate the prolongation of the session into next week.

There is a good deal of speculation as to whether he will again be able to assume the burden of his position. It is said the reason for the urgency of his movements was to enable him to escape the Wall Street broker and other agents who have given him no peace in their incessant demand for something to be done to relieve the market by anticipating interest, or making a new bond call. Folger was scarcely less importuned by the Custom House broker in their efforts to obtain rulings on the new tariff law. Unclogging the fund. New York, March 20.

18870329,historical,snow,"ANN H WARD, Aid, Patrick Kennedy asked the chairman of the Road committee if he could kindly send some men and carts out to Forfar and Conway streets, point St. Charles, to have the piles of snow removed. Residents of the locality were put to great inconvenience by the huge piles of snow now accumulated on the streets. He also asked that the snow should be removed from Grey Nun and King streets, as it interfered with the traffic to the merchants' stores. Aid Laurent said that there were mountains of snow all over the city. Already $30,000 has been expended in removing it, and they did not know what to do even now. Seven hundred and fifty men and 450 carters were employed and the Road committee could not please everyone. Aid Kennedy complained that snow and ice taken from the streets should be dumped on St. Patrick's square. He believed some more suitable place could be found than this. Aid Laurent said he would do his best in the matter and endeavor to carry out Aid Kennedy's wishes. Aid Cunningham then said he was on four committees: the markets, fire, health and light. The latter two he could not attend to and he tendered his resignation on them with a motion to the effect that Aid Kennedy should be appointed in his place. Aid THE QUEEN'S JUBILEE On motion of Aid Stevenson, a committee was appointed to report on the best means of celebrating the Queen's jubilee in the city. The council adjourned. A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE A McGill Medical Student Visits the Back River and is not Seen Again Foul Play Feared Certain Houses at the Back River to be Searched. A medical student of McGill University named Albert Hamer, of Grantfold, Out., residing at 123 St. Alexander street, has disappeared in the most mysterious manner, and notwithstanding a most diligent search by Chief Detective Cullen and Detective Lapointe no trace as yet has been found of the young man. It appears that on Thursday last, in company with three fellow students, Hamer drove to the Back River, and on the return journey they stopped at Mr. Frigon's hotel for refreshments. After stopping a short time Hamer went out and did not return. His companions naturally supposed that he had walked into the city, so they drove in to catch up with him, but saw nothing of him. On making enquiries at his home they learned that he had not come back. They then drove back to the hotel, but Mr. Frigon informed them that the young man had not come back again. The students again returned to the city, and driving to the Central Police station laid the facts before Detective Lapointe, who then proceeded to Mr. Frigon's hotel, but with no better result. The detective then went around to all the neighboring farm houses until he came to the first clue at the Priest's farm. The occupant told him that a young man of the description of Mr. Hamer had come to the house on Thursday afternoon and asked the way to the depot. A little boy showed him to the hotel and left him there. The detective returned to Frigon's, but he denied absolutely having seen the young man after he left the house early in the afternoon. A search party was then organized, and the snow for miles around examined in every direction with no result. A party of students also organized a search party, and every little hillock and elevation was turned over to no effect. The students then went to Frigon's inn and cross-questioned him, when he stated that Hamer had showed $100 when in the bar, and that someone might have seen the money and followed and made away with him. The missing gentleman is only 22 years old, of small stature and of a very genial character, which made him the friend of every student. Just before the trip to Back River he had a $100 cheque cashed in one of the city banks. Today at convocation he was to receive the doctor's degree. The case is a very sad one, causing great anxiety and consternation both among the students and the faculty. The opinion of some is that he has taken the wrong train, while others think that he has met with an accident, or been the victim of foul play. Chief Detective Cullen and Detective Lapointe have a search warrant and are searching all the neighboring houses. THE NEW BOARDER Attempts to Relieve the Others of Some of Their Belongings. There is a very respectable boarding house on St. Constant street, kept by a French-Canadian, in which resides six lodgers, who have all been there for several years and who get on well together. About a month ago another boarder took up his quarters there who, for some reason or other, did not get on well with the others. Yesterday afternoon one of the boarders came home early and was considerably astonished to find the new man going through a trunk belonging to one of the others. He detained him until the owner of the trunk came in, which he did at 6 o'clock, rather the worse for liquor. On his asking the new man what he was doing in his trunk, the only reply he got was a punch on the nose. A row ensued and the new man was mastered and Chief Detective Cullen sent for. On arrival they wanted the trunk riller to be arrested, but said they would not prosecute, so Cullen refused to make the arrest, the trunk's owner then settled matters by kicking the other man into the street. THE SNOWSTORM Again Demoralizes Railway Travel on Certain Routes A Slight Accident. With the exception of the Delaware & Hudson and Central Vermont trains, all incoming trains arrived nearly on time last night. The Delaware & Hudson is stuck between St. John and Rouse's Point. The Central Vermont is reported an hour and a half late. The Canada Atlantic ran off the track on the way in, and one of the cars was upset in a snowbank. Mr. THOS. QUESTIONS Mr. Faucher de Saint Maurice Does the Government intend to put into operation the conclusions of the first paragraph of the second report of the Committee of Agriculture, submitted to the Legislative Assembly at the sitting of the 5th of June, 1886, and unanimously adopted by the Legislature at the sitting of the 14th June, 1886? This paragraph reads as follows: """"Your committee has the honor to report that it is of the utmost importance for colonization and the development of the province of Quebec, which comprises the counties of Dorchester, Bellechasse, Montmagny, Lévis, Kamouraska and Wolfe, that a careful and well-directed survey should place your honorable house in a position to pass a measure which will essentially develop the great resources of this region, an exploration which will show the nature of its mineral, forest and agricultural riches, and also the possibility of constructing a railway through the above mentioned counties."""" Mr. McShane Yes. Mr. Faucher de St. Maurice - Does the Government intend to continue the publications of the Jugements et Délibérations du Conseil Souverain de la Nouvelle France, and of other important documents to be found in the Department of Registrar of the province of Quebec? Mr. Gagnon Under consideration. Mr. Nantel To what printer or printing company has the Government given the contract for the sessional printing during the present session? Did the Government ask for tenders before giving the contract to such printer or printing company? Mr. Mercler The sessional printing has been given temporarily to J.M. Another Windy Day to Add to Winter's Record. Toronto, Ont., March 20, 1 a.m. The depression central over Lake Erie yesterday is now over the Maritime provinces, where it is causing high winds and rain or sleet, and has also given during the day high winds, with snow, in Quebec. The pressure is now increasing in the Lake and St. Lawrence districts, with fair, cold weather. There is a depression setting in over the Northwest, with milder weather. St. Lawrence Northwest and west winds; fine weather; lower temperature, more especially at night. MONTREAL'S RECORD P. Sherwood, of the Dominion police, Ottawa, that he was detained by the snowstorm and could not be present until the next day. In consequence of this Mr. Charles Buise's bail bond was discharged and his parole of honor taken to appear thereafter. H. McNeil, John Kay, Wm. Kay, Daniel Robertson, Montreal, June 17, 1789, flood the property around and a deposit of filth will be left to fester in the sun. Dr. Laberge, some time ago, reported a number of these cases, saying that it was very dangerous to public health, and the matter was referred to the Road committee and there it rests, for the road department claims it is the duty of the police to look after the nuisance, and the police claim it is the duty of the Health department. Mr. Ethier, assistant city attorney, gives it as his opinion that every policeman has the right to take cognizance of such a nuisance. The city by-law provides a penalty of $20 or two months for depositing dirt, dust, refuse, etc., in any vacant lot or public square or street. Those who have suffered damage by their property being flooded by the melted snow can recover from the owner of the lot, who can also be obliged to remove any refuse that may have been deposited with the snow, besides being prosecuted for causing a public nuisance. A MEETING OF THE PROTESTANT MINISTERS Meeting of the Ministerial Association Yesterday. The regular meeting of the Protestant Ministerial Association took place yesterday in the V.O. Crout. TOM BOULT A BOURNE, Agents, 7 St. Francois Xavier St., Montreal. """"WHERE ARE THE POLICE?"""" TO THE EDITOR OF THE GAZETTE Sir, May I ask of you the favor to insert the following few remarks: 1. Where are the police? and 2. Where are the poor foot passengers to walk? At noon today I was walking up McGill street when I had to move off the sidewalk in front of a small retail hardware store which was blocked with a large railway team and two horses delivering some goods, and having to return shortly after, I had again to move off into the middle of the road in front of a seed store lower down, where I found two large teams on the sidewalk, which it was impossible to pass. How, Mr. editor, if we poor foot passengers are in danger of being run over in the middle of the road and complain of the fast trotters, we are told to """"keep on the sidewalk."""" If we go where we are by law and reason and common sense allowed and supposed to go, we are told by the teamsters to """"get into the middle of the road."""" I have come to the conclusion that the police force here is simply a delusion and snare. I never saw one yet where he should be, and the general opinion now is that they are of """"no use,"""" and unless our excellent Mayor, Mr. Abbott, will take up this matter and give us at least some place where we can walk, I will get up petitions asking that the police force be abandoned. It was only the other day that I saw a swell tandem driven by a swell driver, going down the sidewalk of St. James street, and no policeman to interfere. Verily the taxpayers of Montreal are a long-suffering people. Yours respectfully, NO PLACE TO WALK. """"WHAT AN OBJECTIONABLE STORY."""" The following is peculiarly unfortunate in the choice of his good and, so far as I know, new. A political company if he does not agree with PUBLIC DUMPS. Owners of Vacant Lots, who Permit their Lots to be Used as a Dumping Ground, Responsible for Damages to Adjoining Properties. It appears that certain parties are routing out vacant lots owned by them as public dumps, and in those is dumped all the dirty snow taken from yards, the owner of the lot receiving as compensation about two cents a load. The residents in the vicinity very naturally complain of this, as when the hot weather comes the melted snow will probably cause a nuisance.

Cantleman, a passenger conductor employed on the Grand Trunk Railway, yesterday morning was in charge of a snowplough employed in clearing the track between the city and Rouse's Point. The plough, with Cast Icm in charge and three working hands, left at 4 o'clock in the morning. About 5 o'clock, at Krosseau, it became stuck in the snow. Castleman leaped off with the intention of warning the trains which would shortly be passing. Before he had got clear of the plough, the latter took upon him, struck him on the head and killed him almost instantly. The remains were conveyed to St. John, Que., where an inquest was held yesterday forenoon, and the remains were brought back to the city in the afternoon. The deceased was about 35 years of age and lived at 62 Charron Street. He had been in the employ of the Grand Trunk for several years, and was a steady, hard-working man. He leaves a wife and two children, for whom great sympathy is manifested in their sudden affliction. THE SNOW BLOCKADE. The inconvenience caused by the snowstorm of Saturday and Sunday is now becoming painfully palpable. Mails are delayed and trains are run with such an utter disregard of timetables as would be charming were they not so ambiguous. With the exception of the Canadian Pacific Railway, all outgoing trains started on time last night, but how they succeeded has yet to be learned. The only arrivals of incoming trains during yesterday were the Central Vermont from New York, and the Grand Trunk Railway from the West. The Canadian Pacific Railway promised to send out their trains about 2 o'clock this morning. To the light receipts, only 138 head having been received during the whole week, on account of the heavy snowstorm which has blocked the roads. Indeed there was not a single bullock on the market this morning, but prices may be quoted steady at 8c to 10c for choice, 3c to 4c for good, and 2c to 3c for inferior to common per lb, live weight. Sheep were steady at 4c per lb, live weight, hogs 4c to 5c per lb, live weight. The New York Mercantile Bulletin says: """"In quinine no business of any consequence has transpired the past few days. There are holders of good foreign brands who are yet prepared to accept 60c for quantities, though for the most popular makes up to 57c is asked, but large buyers are indifferent to the offers made, hence important trading is at a standstill. The domestic makers continue to report a fair movement into consumptive channels, and maintain former prices steadily."""" For quinine there has continued a quiet market, but holders manifest no anxiety to sell, quoting $3.70 for single cases, $3.70 to $4.80 for jobbing lots, and $4.50. Huntingdon, of Nipissing, who said that one thing that struck him was the contrast between the treatment accorded to missionaries only four years ago and the kindly consideration they now received. Four years ago when attending conference he found it exceedingly difficult to interest leading men in the subject of missions, especially in the missions of the district of Nipissing. Four years ago the country which he represented was almost an unbroken wilderness, its wealth of timber, mineral and other resources being unknown until the advent of the Canadian Pacific Railway, some few years ago. When first he took charge of his present mission he was staggered by the tremendousness of the work, and he asked himself can we ever evangelize this race, but he remembered that there was one who had said """"Go ye into all the world, and lo, I am with you always."""" The speaker then detailed the difficulties which the missionaries encountered at the outset of their work, principal among which was the utter demoralization of the people through contact with the white men. He wondered how it was that men coming from Canadian lands and Christian homes could ever sink to such a depth of degradation as do some of those young men, the sons of pious parents, well educated and fully equipped for the battle of life, when removed from the restraints of home and society. The speaker strongly denounced the system of licensing now prevailing in the Northwest, and gave some amusing descriptions of the dodges resorted to get whiskey into the country surreptitiously. Another difficulty was the great distances in his territory, the only means of travel being by bark canoes in summer and on snowshoes in winter, it never being safe at either time to travel without a compass in one's pocket. He then spoke of the successes which had been accomplished. Four years ago there was but one missionary in the field, today there are three ordained men and four others, making a total of seven, while at intervals throughout the country there are mission churches. After a lengthy description of the scenes in which he worked, the work done and the successes attendant upon his efforts, in which was included a number of remarkable and sudden conversions, the speaker concluded with an urgent appeal to liberal-minded Christians to give of their means abundantly and so help along the Lord's work. Rev. Dr. Douglas being called upon, said that at such a late hour he would not detain the audience. He would merely express the pleasure he had experienced at listening to the excellent practical addresses from which he had gathered quite an amount of new information. The Rev. Doctor then pronounced the benediction and the meeting dispersed. STANSTEAD. To believe our adversaries, a terrible defeat awaited Mr. Colby in Stanstead, but there, as elsewhere in the Eastern Townships, the electors showed their good sense and their recognition of faithful service. The following is the vote: Majority for Colby, Majorities in the following: 87 Barnston, 9 Stanstead, 27 Compton, 60 K 1. THREE RIVERS. The following was the state of the polls at the close of the Three Rivers election, according to Le Journal de Trois-Rivières: Langevin, 640; Premier, 610. Majority for Sir Hector Langevin, 30. Le Journal says that the majority would have been 200 or 300 but for the despicable means to which the opponents of Sir Hector resorted to injure his cause. All the foes of the Government had concentrated their efforts, the provincial authorities lending their aid to prevent the return of Sir John Macdonald's colleague. Of the 900 who signed the requisition to Sir Hector, less than 700 registered their votes in his favor, so rancorous was the influence brought to bear on the electorate. MR. COTTIHAN SNOWED UP. The following telegram was received from Hon. Mr. Costigan at the Inland Revenue Department: """"Grand Falls, N.B., February 20. Roads and highways completely blocked by a tremendous snowstorm. Will start on snowshoes today."""" This will give the millinter twenty-six miles of snowshoeing to reach the nearest railway. H. I. V. Yundicutt telegraphed to the Secretary of State to say that he would be happy to meet him, but the roads were impassable owing to the storm. The gentleman left for Ottawa last evening. EMIGRATION OPENED IN THE NORTHWEST. The snow has done farmers will soon begin work. Winnipeg, February 28. One hundred and thirty-one emigrants arrived last week. Most of them were well-to-do farmers from the old country who intend going into farming on an extensive scale. The Manitoba Government emigration agency opens tomorrow. The thermometer registers 50 above zero in the Northwest Territories and the snow has almost disappeared. Farming operations will probably be in full blush in a few days. THE FIRE. The fire in the club building at 83 Wellington Street. The furniture and personal effects of the club were damaged to the extent of about $1,000, covered by insurance. The building, which is owned by ex-Mayor Manning, is damaged to the extent of about $4,000, covered by a policy of $4,000 in the Northern. There was only the steward and his assistant in the club at the time, but it is supposed that they must have been smouldering for hours before it broke out. How it originated is at present a mystery.

THE DOMINION CAPITAL. New Northwest Judges appointed. Rumored New Military Reserves - The Snow Blockade. Ottawa, February 28. The Canada Gazette, issued today, contains the proclamation dividing the Northwest into judicial districts and the appointment as judges of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories of Messrs. It is understood that the Government will ask Parliament at the coming session to vote $75,000 in the military estimates to be devoted to the purpose of establishing a permanent company of infantry at Lorne, N.B., and a battery of artillery at Victoria, B.C. The battery, as it will probably be called, will be devoted to garrison purposes, the barracks will probably be erected at Esquimalt, where the celebrated dry dock is located, and where the British naval squadron in the Northern Pacific calls for coal. Not a train has left or arrived in Ottawa all day, both the Canada Atlantic and Canadian Pacific railway lines being blocked. The Canada Atlantic was cleared this afternoon, but just afterwards an engine and snowplough ran off the track, renewing the blockade. The city council this evening appointed a deputation to wait upon the Ontario Government concerning the school of practical science, which it is asked, should be established in this city in connection with the Provincial Normal School.",
18890408,historical,snow,"A SPRING SNOWSTORM, Washington and Other Cities have an Unusual April Experience, Washington, April 6, A heavy snow, wind and rain storm has prevailed here since early this morning. The rain, which began falling some time before daylight, at about 8 o'clock changed to snow, and from that hour until after dark tonight the air has been dense, with great flakes driven before a strong north wind. But the weather being mild, it melted as it fell. Several times during the day heavy peals of thunder were heard and sparks of lightning frequently darted across the switchboards in the telegraph offices. The telephone and fire alarms throughout the city are more or less demoralized, and telegraphic communication with the South and West is wholly cut off. Washington, April 7, Yesterday's storm interrupted electrical communication. There are 84 poles down between Alexandria and Fredericksburg, Va.

THE KAISER'S AMBITION To make Germany one of the foremost naval powers, Berlin, April 6, On Tuesday the Emperor will go to Wilhelmshaven to inspect the new naval vessel before that vessel sails for Samoa. His Majesty's letters to Admiral von der Goltz, chief of the admiralty, expressing confidence that the recent disaster at Kautz will not hinder the prosperous development of the navy do not represent the real state of his mind. He keeps the Admiralty busily engaged in supplying him with reports, minutely detailing the construction and condition of every warship. Since the English Parliament voted the addition of 70 ships to the navy, His Majesty's attention centers exclusively upon Admiralty affairs. The officials expect that the recently advanced scheme for the reorganization of the navy will be made and arranged. The Emperor firmly expresses a determination to make Germany a naval power of the first rank. LONSDALE THE LONELY, An Interesting Story of His Rambles in the Land of the Unknown, PHILADELPHIA, April 6, The Inquirer today prints the following interesting story of Lord Lonsdale's travels: The erratic Lord Lonsdale, who was recently reported dead in the Arctic regions, is on his way home to England again. The first authentic news from him in months was printed in the Inquirer yesterday morning. It was derived from a letter just received at Bethlehem from Mr. Wolf, the Moravian missionary stationed at Nushagak, near Fort Alexandra, on Bristol Bay, Alaska, in latitude 60° north, longitude west. Further details from the same source give an interesting account of the Earl's travels. Lord Lonsdale arrived at the Niohnauk mission December 15 of last year and after a long and tedious journey of 4,000 miles overland from Banks Land, in latitude 75° north. This was the furthest point north that he reached. He was hospitably entertained at the mission and remained there until January 14 of this year. His outfit at this time consisted of eight sleds and seventy team dogs in charge of Eskimo drivers and some Indian servants. He was quite exhausted from hardships and hunger. The country he had traversed from Banks Land was rough and open, with very little patrimony upon which to draw for provisions. The snow was terribly drifted, and the sledding so bad that most of the journey was made on foot, the dogs barely managing to drag the sleds loaded with the camp outfit and provisions. The cold experienced was intense. On the first of December the thermometer registered 105 below the freezing point. Men and animals were exhausted, and progress was very slow. Frequently stops were made for a week in favorable localities, and all hands went out to hunt hares and reindeer for food. Terrible blizzards swept across the country continually, and the utmost exertions were necessary to keep the sleds from being scattered and frozen to death. Eleven dogs died from overwork and many of the remaining seventy were in bad condition. Lord Lonsdale remained a month at the mission, enjoying the society of Mr. Wolf, who was the first white man he had seen for years, with the exception of the servant who accompanied him. He estimates that he traveled by dog sled and on foot all but 10,000 miles, from Winnipeg in a little more than a year. In the Hudson's Bay region, where the snow and ice were smooth, the dogs frequently carried them over 200 miles a day. The Earl had no particularly exciting adventures to relate other than those necessarily incident to Arctic travel. Of three he had his fill share. Cold, hunger, scurvy and other misfortunes beset him constantly, but his courage kept up all the time and he was in excellent spirits, notwithstanding he could not make the North Pole as he originally intended. He left the mission at Nushagak January 14, and with his dog train started across the peninsula to Katmai on the North Pacific. From here he crossed to Kodiak, on Kodiak Island, where there is a whaling station. From Kodiak he sent back a shipload of items to Mr. Wolf with his compliments. The Eskimo party were to start at once from Nushagak to their homes in the Unuk Bay country. The Earl sent word that he would sail for England at once, but no news has been received of his arrival at any American port, and it is possible that he has turned winter to escape some new experience. A JHO BULLETIN, Of More or Less Interesting News from our Prairie Country, WINNIPEG, April 7, A difference has arisen between the Hudson's Bay Company and the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway Company. Mr. Brydges, the late land commissioner for the former company, agreed to give a block of land on the Hudson's Bay Company's flats, twenty acres in extent, for $10,000, and wrote a letter to that effect. Some time afterwards Mr. Brydges intimated to the Northern Pacific & Manitoba that the board in England had declined to ratify this arrangement and recently Macdonald and Tupper, acting for the company, wrote to the City Council, stating that no sale had been made to the Northern Pacific & Manitoba Railway, and requested that solicitors be consulted before any streets were closed in that section. The supposition is that the Hudson Bay Company have repudiated the transaction because the price was not large enough. The Northern Pacific & Manitoba Railway consider that Mr. Brydges was empowered to make the sale in question, and will fight the matter out in the courts. It is just possible that these developments may interfere with the prosecution of work on this property pending a settlement. A rumor is now current that Mr. Colcleugh, the member for St. Andrews, will succeed Treasurer Jones in the local cabinet, and that he will be opposed by Robert Bullock, a leading merchant of Selkirk. Gabriel Dumont, whose visit to Winnipeg was kept very quiet, remaining with friends up the Red River, has gone to see his brethren on the Saskatchewan. The number of immigrants arriving here in March was 6,015, the largest number in any month on record. Last week's arrivals numbered 1,403. At tomorrow evening's meeting of the City Council a resolution will be passed asking Mr. Hearth, W.T. has been incorporated as a town and polling for mayor and council took place yesterday. Bank managers report that money is not coming in very rapidly, but the financial condition is just what they expected it would be at this season of the year. The oldest son of Webb, who was hanged for wife murder at Brandon, is wandering about that place without anyone to look after him and is losing his reason, owing to the terrible affliction through which he passed. Mr. Cumming, of Brandon, succeeds Mr. Colcleugh as bursar of Selkirk Asylum. Land Commissioner Smith returned from the East today. The river is rapidly rising. A Hamilton Mystery Solved, Hamilton, Ont., April 7, Miss Louisa Mackelcan, whose sudden disappearance on Monday last caused much suspense among her relatives and friends and aroused considerable interest among citizens, was found on Saturday morning in A. Frid's brick yard, in the extreme west end of the city, by Mr. Leonard Foster. Mr. Foster was going through the brick yard when he was attracted near the kiln by his dog, who was making an unusual noise. He discovered the lady, who when questioned acknowledged that she was Miss Mackelcan and accompanied Mr. Foster without showing resistance. There is no doubt her mental affliction has caused her to wander to the brick yard and since Monday she has spent most of her time in and about the kiln. When found Miss Mackelcan talked rationally and said she had not tasted food since she left home and had lived in the kiln for three nights and the other night had slept out in the snow. She had on her feet only her overshoes and in the kiln near the warm ashes her shawl and shoes were found. Miss Mackelcan said she thought someone was pursuing her and she went to the brick yard to avoid them. She seemed to be in good condition physically and was taken home by her friends who were the recipients of congratulations from sympathizers from all parts of the city when the news of Miss Mackelcan's being found and well had spread. A PANAMA, April 7, Since the suspension of work on the canal over 5,000 laborers have been repatriated from the Isthmus. A consular investigation shows that there are still over 5,000 persons on the line of the works who are destitute. Some deaths from starvation have already been reported, and it is feared that many more will occur if prompt measures are not taken by the West Indian Governments to send the people back to their homes. Negroes and women and children are the worst sufferers. Despite the great distress good order prevails.

NAVIGATION, Chicago, April 7, The grain fleet will start out on its trip down the Great Lakes at the first favorable wind. The start has in fact been made by the schooner Kaimah C. Hutchinson, but the brisk northeaster yesterday brought her back to port. Up to last night the room chartered in the lift was for 200,000 bushels of corn, 230,400 bushels of wheat and 67,100 bushels of oats. The total corn capacity wintering here was about 1,000,000 bushels, and just half has been chartered. The rates have ranged from 1 cent early in the winter to 2 ½ cents yesterday on corn to Buffalo. In contrast with previous winters comparatively few boats have been loaded until along toward the opening of navigation. ABSOLUTELY PURE, This powder never varies.

Police Court. Selling liquor without a license took $93 and cents out of Nellie Hull's pocket. Miss Nettie Bedsteail hails from Cornwall, Ont., and holds the position of captain in the Salvation Army. She came down to this city Christmas morning and deposited herself and her worldly effects in the Salvation Army barracks. Soon after her arrival the effects were missed and when the police found them they were in the possession of Peter Gorman and John McGuire, whom they arrested. They were found guilty and sentenced to six months each. Joseph Chagnon saw things so blue on Christmas that he tried to hang himself. The police interfered and His Honor, who saw that whiskey was the cause of Joseph's distress, discharged him on his promising not to do it again. Thomas Milton drank and drank on Christmas day until he was drunk. While in this glorious state of intoxication he turned his attention to his wife. When he had finished, a policeman requested him to come over and interview His Honor. The man didn't care about going, but the policeman was so persistent that at last he gave in. The result of the interview was that Mrs. Milton will be a widow for two months. Edward Bergin ruined his footing on Christmas day by stealing a goat skin from a man named Pilkicr, but which he was relieved of by a policeman shortly afterwards. His Honor relieved him of his liberty for ten days. The next occupants of the dock were Joseph Lapointe, Joseph Jobin, and Ovila Deiordi. They were accused of having snowballed Walter Falls, a patrolman of the Royal Electric Light Company, and when he objected, they considerately changed their treatment to bare knuckles. The explanation comes off on Saturday. Three other men, who also took a hand in, are requested to call at any police station and help in the explanation. Church and Croysdill, the two young men who got $105 out of another young man named Lee by telling him that he was under arrest and that that sum would settle matters, as reported in these columns at the time, were committed to the Court of Queen's Bench. Michael Doolan was fined $3, requested to pay $3 damages or go into confinement for three months for having smashed several windows and a door lock of John Barry's residence. Court of Special Reunion. John G. Strachan, the man arrested for stealing lead piping from Joe Beef's old saloon, was found guilty. Since John has been boarding at Payette's it has been discovered that he was the leading genius in a series of small robberies in which various articles, ranging from a cooking stove down to a felt hat valued at 75 cents, had been taken. His Honor sized John up, and in the end considered that the world would not miss John for two years and that during that time he could fill a long-felt want in the select society of St. Vincent de Paul penitentiary. Recorder's Court. There was a long parade in this court yesterday of people who had taken a drop too much on Christmas day. Of the forty-seven cases on the list, three-quarters of them obtained the honor of an introduction to His Honor through a little drunk they had had. His Honor kindly let them off at $3 a head, and when the heads which could pay up had done so it was found that the city was $84 better off. Theophile Theberge, for committing an indecent assault upon Joseph Dupre, in Notre Dame church, obtained a chance to figure among the innocent at Payette's for two months. Helbmann Upright Pianos are built regardless of expense to successfully reproduce the most extreme atmospheric changes. Holiday stock of these famous Pianos now on sale. C. H.

Ex-Alderman Stroud is busy with his invitations for the big snowshoers' supper on the 23rd of next month, and the boys may rely upon having a rattling good time. Mr. George Middleton, the well-known Chicago horseman, offers to match the famous gray gelding, Jack, against any trotter in the world for from $5,000 to $15,000. Numerous operations have been performed lately by English veterinarians to cure roaring by removing the arytenoid cartilage, but the result is now officially declared to be a failure. A well-known athlete says: It is a safe prediction that there will be half a dozen American amateur runners on the cinder path next season who will be able to beat 61 seconds for a quarter. Joe Donoghue, champion amateur skater, appeared before a large throng at the Palace rink in Minneapolis on Saturday evening, and was well received. He gave an exhibition mile over a 7½-lap course, covering the distance in 2:05, and it was done with apparent ease. The McGill Football Club has elected these officers: President, Mr. SOWB1IOEIXG. The Crescents Tramp. In spite of the gale that tore along the roads and howled through the naked branches of the trees, the Crescents mustered in full force for their tramp to the Athletic Club house. Once arrived at that snowshoers' haven of rest, the usual enjoyable time was spent. Songs were sung by Messrs. F. Anley, and after some other routine business had been transacted, the club started on the homeward tramp, thoroughly pleased with the evening's outing. The Club House. Mr. James Paton has evidently not let the grass grow under his feet in his efforts to improve and beautify the Athletic Club house. The lower club room is rapidly approaching completion, and by the first week of the new year it will re-echo to the merry songs of the snowshoers. The work of kalsomining the walls is also being pushed forward, and several of the rooms are already finished. The ladies' dining room is a little-gem, thanks to the efforts of Mrs. James Paton, Mrs. Fred Larmonth, and Mrs. Hugh Cameron, whose deft fingers and feminine taste have done so much towards the ornamentation, and the other rooms show marked improvement. Nor have our citizens been backward in donations towards the welfare of the snowshoers' rendezvous. Messrs. P. are mentioned as the probable reform candidate for Lisgar at the next Dominion election. Resolutions protesting against the abolition of the French language in schools have been passed by the trustees of the Norquay school district. Wheat is quoted at from 60 to 76 cents.

The New York World has obtained from the treasurer of each state the value of property as assessed for taxation. The census taken in 1880 made a report of its exhaustive and laborious inquiry into the proportions existing in each state between income and property, which ranges between 8 percent in Illinois and 18 in Wyoming. The report shows an increase in taxable property of $1,000,000 and an increase in actual wealth of $1,000,000. SHIPMAN ENGINES, COAL OIL, Marine and Stationary.

The Brazil-lit Brazil-lit II has received the following cablegram, dated today, from Guy Brio, minister of finance at Rio Janeiro: The report about the meeting of a corps of artillery is false. There was only a meeting of a few soldiers, immediately repressed. The circumstances increased confidence in the government, which shows it is prepared with prompt and decisive means to put down any disturbance of public order. The aggravation of General da Fonseca's illness is not true; on the contrary, he is recovering speedily from his former complaints. The assistant doctor believes his recovery to be certain. At any rate, the fate of the revolution, now accepted by the whole country, does not depend on the contingency of any one man's life, however precious it may be. In the army itself, the revolution can rely on other chiefs of great prestige and no less devoted to the cause. All the different political parties have espoused with enthusiasm the term fixed, November 15, 1889, for the meeting of the constitutional assembly, they considering by this act the stability of the republic is assured. """"Beware of newsmongers."""" A Most Significant Fact. New York, December 20. Private cables received today from Brazil state that the markets for exchange at both Rio and Para are in bad shape, while the rubber supply on hand will only last a few weeks. Rubber has taken an upward jump. At Para, exchange is demoralized, while at Rio the rate has declined 2 percent to 2. This makes a total decline of 8 percent since Dom Pedro's expulsion.

Mr. Frank Boss' Magnificent Donation. Getting Ready for Next Season's Timber Trade. A Case of Influenza. Quebec, December 26. It is said that Mr. Frank Boss, of this city, brother of the late Senator James Gibb Boss, has acquired the Marine hospital at Quebec, and that he has donated $1,000,000 to found an institution for the sick of all creeds and nationalities. A very large quantity of deals arrives daily by the Lake St. John railway, and are discharging on the Louise embankment ready for shipment in the spring. It is said 40,000,000 feet of lumber will be taken out along the line this winter. A fierce snowstorm from the east set in about noon and still continues. It is reported that a genuine case of influenza has broken out here. The sufferer is 8.",

most extraordinary report of death by freezing comes from Chapleau, a station on the Canadian Pacific railway, north of Lake Nipissing, A party, on entering a deserted blacksmith's shop near Chapleau a few days ago, discovered the dead body of a man standing with his back to the wall, his legs spread wide apart and eyes opened, It appears that two men, who had been working together on the Canadian Pacific railway during the summer, had saved some money, and after hunting in the neighborhood through the winter, intended to start for British Columbia in the spring, One Saturday about three weeks ago, they started out on a hunting expedition, and after crossing a small lake, concluded to go into camp for the night, After building a fire and making other necessary preparations, one of them complained of not feeling well, and said he would go back to the starting place, intending to return when he felt better, His companion concluded to stay and continue hunting, After hunting for two days, the latter started back for the settlement, and, upon reaching the lake, where they had crossed, he was horrified at finding the body of his chum lying on the snow, covered with ice, with the legs wide apart and the limbs rigid in death, A moccasin and stocking were off one of the feet, and the remains of a small fire were nearby, While crossing the lake, which was slushy, he had evidently wet his feet, being chilled with the cold, made to dry them and warm himself, In doing this, his hands and arms probably got numbed and powerless with frost, and, after pulling off the moccasin and stocking, he was unable to put them on until the intense frost then gradually overcame him, till it finally held him motionless in death, when he sank back into the snow, His companion then made his way back to the settlement, placing it in the deserted blacksmith's where it now remains, The friends of the deceased, residing at Chapleau, were notified of what had occurred, and in reply requested that the body be embalmed and sent home, but owing to the frozen condition of the limbs, which rendered it difficult to place the corpse in a coffin and for want of funds, nothing was done, THE WEATHER, Toronto, Ont., February 4, The pressure continues very high throughout the Lake and St. Lawrence districts, It has decreased in the Maritime and Gulf districts, owing to a depression off the coast, which is causing a fall of snow in southern Nova Scotia, Elsewhere, the weather continues fair and very cold everywhere from the Lakes to the Atlantic, It has moderated in the Northwest and is blowing a southerly gale in Manitoba, with temperature at home, whilst in Assiniboia and Alberta the temperature varies from 3 to 19 above zero, PROBABILITIES, St. Lawrence, Winds mostly fresh from

distance on the road of what we are pleased to call civilization, Spade and distaff are buried together, the cultivator and the spinning jenny have replaced them, and we bear not on our escutcheons those rude reminders of our beginning, The race for greatness absorbs all our energies, and if we do not achieve it we gain bigness, bulk, expansion, Like the frog in the fable, we first supply a laughing stock to each other, then burst, and as we lie down beside the forgotten spade and distaff, other froggies take possession of our boots, or our moccasins, to go through the same course with additions, We are for big fortunes, big factories, big farms, big houses or hostelries, In our imitations of the big Indian, whose love is for bigness in toboggan, snowshoe, bow and arrow, pelts and pipe (we leave out his love for scalps), we have reason; they are the symbols of his manhood, the only man that he knows, the lower man, and his consolations, Our exercises on snow-clad slopes, and their imitations in wood, and on our native ice, are profitable to us as they are to him, and doubly so, as we know that they promote the twofold soundness of body and of mind, So much cannot be said of many of our more serious """"swellings,"""" The tradesman or """"man of business,"""" in the infinite variety of modern forms, is not content to earn a living or to save a trifle for his family; his aim is to make a fortune, and when we see the men who achieve this bigness (the biggest example has lately been well advertised on having lost his grasp of things), we are reminded of the primitive man who judges what the Christian God thinks of wealth by marking the kind of man on whom He bestows it, and we can understand how the unfortunate helot of our own race, or, yet more, the unfortunate man of education who happens to be """"down on his luck"""" comes to look upon property as being more akin to rob, buy, Need we wonder that the question is raised of the right to food and raiment for at least as many as are willing to work, or that the question arises if the growing pile of the new world is any better for, or less injurious to mankind than the monopoly of the soil of the old world by the accidental owners, In this connection is it not worth while for the middle-aged men of commerce and affairs who continue to toil for the increase of their store to consider whether the present is the best for their declining years, or if they are preparing for their families and securing the best possible career, Steam, the giant power of our day, has done much, perhaps much good, for man, but it has disturbed many economies that have not yet become righted, """"How painful,"""" says Mr. Hagshead in one of his brilliant essays, """"Is the conclusion that it is dubious whether all the machines and inventions of mankind have yet lightened the day's labor of a human being, They have enabled more people to exist, but those people work just as hard, and are just as mean and miserable as the elder and the fewer, Is such a life worth living? Does it bear any relation to the ideal man to whom appeal is made in our public teaching and preaching? Has it a soul, my brother and sister, of the same value, as yours and mine? Steam carries us, and we are proud of having made a way for it, to our vast fields that are waiting for the occupation and toil of man, and when we get there the power that bore us there is set to the work of delving, and in due time harvesting, It is soon found, however, that this process cannot be carried on, Our mother earth, more beneficent to her poor ones than their big brother man, refuses her treasures to this sort of industry, The primeval law, """"In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread,"""" is inalienable, and family life, that life necessary for social improvement, proves necessary for economical development, We abandon the modest shelter of our """"several house"""" to take refuge in a huge hostelry, Weary of getting upstairs, or of the strange sensation of being carried up by a machine, we are dazzled by the light of coal gas, repeated in multitudinous mirrors, subdued (if anything can subdue a nineteenth-century man or woman) by the contemplation of painted wall and ceiling, and polished column, and marble tile and varied ornament in wood and stone, and glass and tissue many of them pleasing to a degree, But it all is little to the """"bill of fare;"""" it is fearful to contemplate in view of the obligations recognized by the average economist, to go through it or let it go through him in order that he may be """"even with the house"""" or with the other """"bill;"""" upon reading, more upon trying it, one ceases to wonder why so many well-to-do people live out but half their days, I hear of a notable instance of self-possession: A manager who resists the general inflation, who is said to be at his ease, natural, careful, kindly attentive, in fact, the ideal host, In too many cases our big undertakings have proved too big for profit; there is a wide resounding cry of """"no returns,"""" Is it the Nemesis of spade, and distaff calling us back to lesser things? It may be well if we give ear, 28 ST. GEORGE Snowshoe Club, SATURDAY, the 6th inst., VLH starting from McGill College Gates at 3:15 p.m. sharp, Cross-country Steeplechase will be run, Five prizes, As this will probably be the last cross-country tramp this season, a good muster is requested, F. L. Paho, Tex., February 4, The feeling in Arizona and New Mexico in favor of the summary execution of Geronimo, the Apache, and surviving members of his band is rapidly growing into a demand, People will demand that the same punishment be meted out to Geronimo and his followers as Kid and his band received at the hands of the Canadian Government, direful estimates place the number killed by these bands during the last raid at 170, many of whom were women, having highly respected connections in the east, Mrs. Herring, who was captured and then murdered near Douglass, was once a belle in Sedalia, Mo., The Mexican consul here is endeavoring to induce the Mexican authorities to make a formal claim for Geronimo and his band from the United States on the ground that the Indians surrendered to Lieut. Mans on Mexican territory, It is stated that there is nothing in the treaty with Mexico to cover such a case, SERIOUS AFFAIR IN A PRISON, PITTSBURGH, February 4, A serious affair occurred in the Riverside penitentiary this morning in which Deputies Mulvan, Greaves and Edwards were injured, the former dangerously, A prisoner named James Clarke, who is serving a sentence of seven years for burglary, had been ordered to the dungeon for an infraction of the rules, McKinney and Greaves repaired to his cell to escort him to the dungeon, He promised to go quietly, but in an unguarded moment he turned upon the men with a large knife, which he had secreted in his coat, He first made a desperate lunge at McKinney and plunged the knife into his neck and then stabbed him in the right temple, Turning from McKinney he thrust the bloody weapon into Greaves' right shoulder blade twice, Deputy Edwards, hearing the noise, came to the aid of McKinney and Greaves, but before he could render them assistance Clarke felled him to the ground and, jumping upon him, beat and kicked him in a frightful manner, By this time the guard had been alarmed and Clarke was overpowered and placed in the dungeon, The injured men were removed to the hospital, where examination showed that McKinney was probably mortally wounded, STREET CAR STRIKERS VICTORIOUS, New York, February 4, The car drivers on the Fourth Avenue, Broadway and Seventh Avenue and Sixth Avenue horse railroads struck this morning and no cars are running on any of the lines named, John G. Caville, general auditor of the Knights of Labor in this city, last night said: The Executive board of the Empire Protective Association and myself have spent two weeks trying to settle the car drivers' difficulties with the presidents of the New York street railroads, but they have made fools of us, We have offered every inducement to them and even accepted their compromise but all to no purpose, Snow is piled up in the streets and a strike at this time will greatly inconvenience the public, A later dispatch says: The directors of the Broadway road held a meeting this morning and instructed the Superintendent to notify the strikers that within a week a schedule would be arranged in accordance with their wishes, It is rumored the men will all go to work this afternoon, The directors of the Sixth Avenue line have decided to concede to the terms demanded, There was great rejoicing among the employees, The difficulty with the Fourth Avenue line was arranged this afternoon, and at 2:30 p.m. the cars started running, This ends the strike, THE EVICTIONS IN THE COKE REGIONS, Pittsburgh, February 4, There were no evictions in the coke regions today, Sixteen additional writs of ejectment were issued this morning, but no efforts were made to serve them, Tomorrow, however, another attempt to force the strikers to vacate the houses will be made, At the same time a strong effort will be made to break the strike, Between two hundred and fifty and three hundred German and Irish laborers were sent into the region from here today, and in the morning several works will be put in operation, Richard Barton, a miller, was present with a team and wagon when the evictions took place, As fast as the sheriff's officers took the furniture from the houses he told them to put it in his wagon, Then he hauled it to his mill and his dwellings, where six of the evicted families are now quartered, The people of Uniontown and the farmers in the surrounding country are aiding the strikers with food, THE CABINET AND THE SILVER QUESTION, Washington, February 4 The Cabinet meeting today was attended by all the members except Secretary Lamar, who is not in good health, The principal topic of discussion was the action of the House of Representatives yesterday in adopting Mr. Bland's resolution calling on the Secretary of the Treasury for information in regard to his past and future policy on the silver question, The propriety and expediency of disclosing the future policy of the administration on this question was considered at length, It is understood that the conclusion reached was that the Secretary could best reply to that portion of the resolution by a reference to the views expressed by the President in his message to Congress and by the Secretary of the Treasury in his annual report on the subject with an explanatory statement that their sentiments in regard to silver remain unchanged, CHICAGO CORRUPTION TO BE TESTED, Chicago, February 4, Police Justice Meech today brought suit in the Circuit Court to recover $27,000 from the Rev. E. Kittredge, who, he claims, libeled him in his sermon of Sunday last, Kittredge is pastor of the Third Presbyterian Church and, after alluding to the alleged maladministration of justice in the courts of the city, referred directly, it is said, to Justice Meech's action in disposing of the cases of 225 gamblers, who were arrested in gambling houses a week ago, He said: """"All fear of law is rapidly passing from the minds of wicked men; lawbreakers are only arrested to be set free at the solicitation of some aldermen or in return for a handsome bribe, as was true this past week when one justice, by the name of Meech, discharged a company of gamblers at the request of the latter, changing the offense from gambling to disorderly conduct and asking only the fine of $1 from each,"""" Dr. Kittredge's sermon was correctly reported; that he will meet the suit fully, but that he will see that a careful scrutiny is made into police court matters, BELL TELEPHONE SUIT, Washington, January 4 Solicitor General Tillman has indicated that he will test the validity of the Bell Telephone patent, which was filed in the manner recommended by the Department of the Interior, The Solicitor has selected able counsel to fight the Department of Justice and intends them to prepare the bill of complaint, which will be finished and filed and the place selected to try the case made public this week, It is said the suit will be tried in some court outside the District of Columbia, probably in Ohio, Indiana or in some court where similar cases have not been tried, THE ICE CARNIVAL, St. Paul, Minn., February 4 This was the greatest night of the ice carnival, Forces stormed the parade held by the snow king, The pyrotechnic display was the most varied and brilliant ever seen in the Northwest Among the participants in the parade were over 200 members of the St. George and Winnipeg snowshoe clubs and other citizens of Winnipeg, Including Premier Norquay and W.",
18860422,historical,ice,"N. Co. While the meeting was in progress a telegram was received from the Kt. Lawrence Co. ratifying the agreement. The consensus of opinion of the shareholders present was that the bargain was to the advantage of the company. None of the company's boats have been damaged by the ice in any way worth mentioning. The Union and St. Lawrence, the lately acquired Saguenay steamers which have been wintering in the River St. Maurice, were moved by the ice, but they are now safe from damage. The L'Antigueuil and Montarville were also forced away from their quarters at Boucherville, but with the aid of the South Eastern they were both towed back to a place of safety. Navigation in the port of Montreal will open today, when the Longueuil will resume her regular trips between the city and Longueuil. It is expected that all the lines between here and the Gulf will have been opened by next Monday. The Quebec will arrive in port Monday morning and will leave for the Ancient Capital the same evening. The Trois Rivieres and Chambly also begin their regular trips on Monday. THE POLICE COMMITTEE held a very short and uninteresting meeting yesterday afternoon. A meeting of the Police committee was held yesterday, at which were present Aid. Jean not (chairman), Brunei, Kennedy, Villeneuve, Dubuc and Lee. A discussion arose about the peddlers travelling from door to door and not paying their license. After some discussion the matter was referred to the Chief. Aid. Kennedy spoke of two men who were employed at the East End abattoir in the pay of the corporation, and it was resolved that so long as the Abattoir company paid the cost of their service it might be continued. The policemen petitioned that they should be excused from payment of the water tax as well as the sergeants of the police. This after some discussion was referred to the Chief. A complaint was entered against the carters on Phillips square for improper conduct and this was left to Chief Paradis to deal with. Some argument arose before the members of the committee concerning the continuance in office of those who had been employed by the St. Jean Baptiste authorities, and it was decided to continue those in office who were meritorious. The meeting then adjourned. THE ROAD COMMITTEE want a special appropriation to repair the damage caused by the floods. A meeting of the Road committee was held yesterday afternoon, when there were present Aid. Laurent (chairman), McShane, Beausoleil, Wilson, Prefontaine, Bainville and Gray. An application from the City band to play in the summer months in the Vigor gardens was granted. It was resolved to report to council for an appropriation of $700 to pay the commissioners on the expropriation of streets. Tenders were opened for general supplies, and the principal one, that for lumber, was awarded to Mr. Huneau. On the motion of Aid. Gray it was resolved to ask the council for a special appropriation to cover the damage to the streets and sidewalks caused by the recent floods. The committee then adjourned. """"EEL AIR,"""" DORVAL As anticipated, the announcement of the sale of the magnificent residence of the late Mr. Alfred Brown, at Mr. William H. Arnton's auction rooms yesterday morning, drew a very large audience of gentlemen representing the wealth of Montreal. THE SITUATION GONE, the City Resuming its Normal Appearance-Condition of the Principal Streets. The river continued to fall steadily all day yesterday and by night nearly every street, with the exception of one or two in the low-lying parts of Griffintown, was dry. All through Griffintown, Point St. Charles and the flooded portions of St. Antoine and West wards the sidewalks were floated by the water, and will have to be relaid. On some streets the sidewalks remain intact, anchored in place by the trees and lamp posts, but more frequently they were used for rafts, and miles of sidewalks will have to be replaced entirely. Last spring this work cost $4,008, and it will probably amount to twice as much this time. On Commissioners street masses of ice, broken sidewalks, barrels, bags and all sorts of material were heaped up in a most peculiar manner. At Bonsecours market the dealers were drying their stock and removing that spoiled. Gangs of men were already at work clearing away the debris in the street. Lichtenhein's rag store, the scene of the late fire, was still smouldering. The appearance of Notre Dame street, Chaboillez square, and the depot was most deplorable. The sidewalks were broken up, plate glass windows smashed, the furniture and fittings of the stores broken to pieces with the debris strewed in all directions and the storekeepers looking anxious and bemoaning their losses. The remains of the broken sidewalks are to be collected and piled on Commissioners street and from this repository in preparing the material for repairs will be drawn until new planks can be purchased to replace those lost, stolen or strayed. The sewers have also been badly damaged by the floods. At St. Lambert the road has not only been rendered totally impassable through being cut up by the shores, but large blocks of ice extend right across it and over the fields adjacent. On the road are piled in all directions telegraph poles, railway sleepers, trestles, heavy timbers belonging to the bridges and outbuildings, fence rails and all kinds of debris from saw mills and other places. The plank sidewalks of the village from one end to the other have been completely carried away. A farmer's son, in trying to save the contents of the barn, is suffering so severely from the effects of exposure in the ice cold water that he is not expected to live. Another man lost his life attempting to swim his mule and another horse over into the water, and both driver and horse were rescued with difficulty. The following butchers have kindly offered purchases of meat for the market: Mr. Jo, Richard, 4011 lbs; Mr. Bottles, 200 bologna sausages and 150 lbs; Mr. A. Desparnwe, 80 lbs, and Mr. G. Haylinger, 100 lbs. THE THIRD READING. The following bills were read a third time and passed: To incorporate the Brockville & New York Bridge company Mr. Wood (Brockville). To amend the criminal law, and to declare it a misdemeanor to leave unguarded and exposed hole cut in the ice on any navigable or frequented waters Mr. Robertson (Hamilton). To amend the Consolidated Railway act of 1871 Mr. McCarthy. THE GRAIN MARKET.

SNOWFALL AT NIAGARA As Keenly as the Small Fruit Crop Is Wiped Out but Little Damage Done in Quebec. Toronto, May 14, Special. From all parts of Ontario come reports of great damage done by the recent cold snap. In some parts frost was so severe that ice formed on standing water to the thickness of half an inch. Farmers and market gardeners who were in the city today said that, besides fruits and vegetables being destroyed, the pea crops in many places were badly nipped. Other grains have escaped. The weather that has followed the big drop in temperature is most favorable. The cold rain removes the chill, but had a hot sun followed, the crops that now look healthy would have turned black. Niagara Falls, Ont., May 14, Snow fell to the depth of four inches this morning, followed during the afternoon by drizzling rain. The grape crop in this locality has been almost totally destroyed, which means thousands of dollars loss. Strawberry patches look as if they had been swept by fire, and cherries suffered severely, as did the peach trees. Corn, potatoes and other vegetables are lying flat on the ground. The season being fully three weeks ahead of last year, the frost Sunday night means hard times for the fruit growers and farmers in the Niagara district. Edytk, Ont., May 14, The frost has done considerable damage to fruit trees, but grain, especially barley and peas, suffered the most. Plmhuokk, Ont., May 14, No damage to crops or fruit by frost in this locality. Smith's Falls, Ont., May 14, Very little damage has been done to crops or gardens by frost in this vicinity. Plantagenet, May 14, Heavy frost last night, but no damage to crops as yet done. Puslinch, Ont., May 14, No damage is as yet apparent from the frost, but it is feared it will do so in a day or so. Shawinigan, Ont., May 14, The frost has completely destroyed fruit and early vegetables of every description in this neighborhood. Fall wheat and barley are also badly injured. Snow has been falling for over two hours this morning. Avonmore, Ont., May 14, There was a slight frost last night, but nothing was damaged to any extent. Hawkesbury, Ont., May 14, Light frost here. No damage done worth mentioning. Bknfiusw, Ont., May 14, Frost has not damaged crops to any great extent. Fruit has escaped fairly well, not being far enough advanced to suffer permanent injury. The plum crop may be affected to some extent. Montkuf, Que., May 14, No frost here on Sunday night. Last night's will damage small fruit, etc., but grain is not enough advanced to have been seriously injured. Cameron Park, Ont., May 14, The slight frost last two nights does not seem to have done much injury in this locality. Aylmer, Ont., May 14, Frost has not hurt crops in this locality, not being sufficiently advanced, but grapes and fruits generally are very badly damaged. Thermometer fell to 28 degrees. St. Stanbridge, Que., May 14, Gardens were not far enough advanced to be damaged by the recent frosts. Some slight damage was done to apple and plum trees. Kazabazua, Que., May 14, Very heavy frost last night, but little damage done to crops around here. Wakefield, Que., May 14, The frost was quite heavy here last night but no damage reported, although fruit trees and tender plants must certainly have been nipped. Hemmingford, Que., May 14, Nothing was damaged by the frost here except cherry and plum blossoms. St. Isidore, May 14, There was a heavy frost in this vicinity last night. The fruit crop, if not lost altogether, is seriously damaged. Brossard, May 14, There was a heavy frost here last night which seriously damaged the fruit crop, if it did not ruin it altogether. Huntingdon, Que., May 14, Garden stuff generally suffered pretty severely from frost last night. Grape vines, cabbage and tomatoes are especially frost bitten. It is a question whether or not fruit trees will be affected. Vaudreuil, Que., May 14, Frost did no damage in Vaudreuil. Across the Lines, St. Paul, May 14, Reports indicate that there was another severe frost last night all over Minnesota and South Dakota. It is feared the damage was even greater than on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. Omaha, Neb., May 14, Railway officials have been conducting an exhaustive search for damage done by last night's frost, and the damage is found to be insignificant; it is chiefly confined to orchards and garden stuffs. KpwNOFisiLD, Ills., May 14, Central Illinois was visited by a heavy frost last night. Grapes and other fruits were badly damaged, corn, which was well advanced, is bitten off close to the ground. Potatoes are killed to the roots and garden vegetables are generally badly damaged. Grand Rapids, Mich., May 14, Reports from various portions of the fruit belt of Western Michigan are to the effect that more damage was done by the gale than by freezing. AN ASSISTANT ENGINEER Knights of Labor Complain That Outsiders are Employed on the Improvement Works. Mr. Henry Bulmer, chairman, presided at the open meeting of the Harbor Commissioners held yesterday afternoon, the other members in attendance being Major Villeneuve, Messrs. Hudon, Hurteau, Morin, Torrance, Ogilvie and Allan. The sub-committee on harbor expenditure reported in favor of the chief engineer, Mr. Kennedy, being authorized to employ an assistant engineer at a salary of not more than $75 per month, and the engagement to be from month to month, so that should the development of the inquiries now going on seem to warrant it, he might be dismissed at any time without involving more than a month's salary. The recommendation was made on the statement of Mr. Kennedy that it was important, in connection with the efficient carrying on of the work, that he have such assistant at once. Mr. Bulmer did not concur in the report, and wished his objection to be recorded, on the ground of economy. He considered that the present staff was sufficient for the work to be done. The report was adopted. The chief engineer, Mr. Kennedy, submitted his monthly report as under: Openings in the winter ice on the harbor began to form in the main channel below the Victoria bridge on the 2nd of April, and in the current St. Mary somewhat earlier. The openings enlarged and joined, and by the 8th of April the main channel was clear from above the Victoria bridge to the foot of the current St. Mary, and a few shoves had taken place. Shoving continued at intervals outside the guard pier and at Windmill point until the morning of the 11th, when the main body of the ice moved off the greater part of La Prairie basin and the part of the harbor outside the guard pier. The space inside the guard pier, and the greater part of the river below Longueuil Point, remained covered until the 21st, when a final movement took place, leaving the whole clear, and navigation opened. Very considerable quantities of ice were left lodged upon all the wharves above the canal entrance and below Victoria pier. The following are the estimated areas and depths: Sections B and 7, Windmill point, 1,000 feet in length by 100 feet in width, was covered to an average depth of 1 foot. Sections 8 to 10, Windmill point, 1,600 feet in length by 75 feet in width, was covered to 6 feet thick. From the mouth of the canal, section 11, to the Richelieu pier, section 17, no ice remained except an occasional lump. Section 17, Richelieu pier, about half the pier, or 100 feet square, was covered to an average thickness of 3 feet. Section 18, Island Ferry wharf, about 800 feet by 100 feet of the pier was covered to an average depth of 1 foot. Section 19, La Prairie ferry wharf, about half the pier, or 60 feet by 180 feet, was covered to an average depth of 2 feet. Section 20, Victoria pier, the downstream end, 600 feet in length by 110 feet in width was covered to an average depth of 7 feet. Sections 21 to 22, a length of 1,000 feet from the Victoria pier downwards, by a width of 100 feet, was covered to an average depth of 5 feet. Sections 22 to 28, a length of 1,200 feet by 100 feet in width, was covered to an average depth of 8 feet. Sections 29 to 30, a length of 1,300 feet by 60 feet in width, was covered to an average depth of 4 feet. Sections 31 to 35, a length of 1,600 feet by 80 feet in width, was covered to an average depth of 6 feet. Sections 36 to 42, a length of 3,900 feet by 76 feet wide, was covered to an average depth of 8 feet. Section 43, new pier, the old pier, or 730 feet by a width of 20 feet, was covered to an average depth of 6 feet. Section 40, sugar refinery pier, on the outer end about half the pier, or 300 feet by 180 feet, was covered to an average depth of 4 feet. The usual clearing of the lodged ice from sites of the freight sheds and other parts of the wharf most urgently needed was commenced on the 17th of April with a force of 160 men, which was increased to 625 men by the 25th, and reduced to 60 men by the 6th of May, when the special work of ice clearing was stopped. Expenditure, including the cost of working a clam-shell derrick eight and a half days, $4,797. On the clearing away of the ice it was found that a piece of cribwork wharf, 194 feet in length, in section 9, Windmill point, built in 1864, was damaged by being undermined by the winter currents, and also that some of the top timber of the unfinished pier in section 44, Hochelaga, had been displaced and lodged on shore; otherwise the wharves suffered no material injury during the winter. The guard pier, although subjected to violent outside shoves, was unharmed; the derricks, locomotives and other working plant wintered upon it were untouched; there was no unusual shoving and no flooding on either south shore or north; the ice inside remained no longer than upon the ship channel, and the adjacent wharves were left practically clear. If HARBOR REPORTS The replacing of mooring posts was commenced on the 18th of April; roadway repairs were commenced on the 22nd; the ordinary cleaning of roadways and wharves was commenced on the 23rd, and repairs to the woodwork of the wharves was commenced on the 24th. The quarrying of macadamizing stone was finished on the 6th of April, and greasing on the 16th. The quantity got out and broken by the Commissioners' men during April was about 60 tons, and the total for the winter was 953 tons. NEW WORKS The making of some additional bents for the temporary trestle of the guard pier was commenced on the 16th of April, and the re-erection of the trestle was commenced on the 24th. A tugboat and two floating derricks, which were wintered in the lower new basin of the canal, were freed as soon as the ice cleared off, and commenced work on the 24th of April, one derrick being set to work to assist in clearing off ice from the wharves and the other to assist in erecting the guard pier trestle. On the 1st day of May the other vessels of the dredging fleet were released from winter quarters and brought into the harbor, after which they were fitted up with their spuds and set to work as quickly as possible. The building of the new tug is being continued by the contractors. At the end of the month the frames of the hull were all set up and the shell and furnace of the boiler were well advanced, but the engine remained practically the same as at last report. The new drill boat was launched on the 2nd of April, and the machinery is now about ready for work. As the contractors for the new drill boat were somewhat behind time with their work, the Chief Engineer was instructed to see into the matter. On the recommendation of the Chief Engineer it was decided to purchase, at a cost of $180, one of the steam winches of the wrecked steamship Naverton. C. Landre and Mr. Willett. Miss Georgie Learned was heard to advantage in """"Pierrot,"""" the pianissimo portions being finely rendered. Mr. Hodgson thoroughly caught the audience with his singing of """"In Night's Still Calm."""" Mrs. Landre gave a good interpretation of Tchaikovsky's """"Ave Maria,"""" and Mr. Willett acquitted himself well in his solo, """"Willow the Wisp."""" Gounod's """"Ruth,"""" the interpretation of Gounod's """"Ruth,"""" given in the Church of St. James the Apostle last evening, in aid of the choir fund, might justly be termed a musical treat, and to say that it was enjoyed by the large audience present is expressing the appreciation of its patrons very mildly. To Mr. Raynor, the organist, upon whom has devolved the training of the choir for the event, the result must have been very gratifying. The choruses went with a vim, that commencing """"Rejoice, for blessings round us fall,"""" being exceedingly well rendered; indeed, the entire interpretation of the cantata was such as to leave no room for fault-finding. The soloists were Miss Raynor, Miss Munro, Miss Macartney, Mr. Frank Ibbotson and Master Blair Russell, all of whom acquitted themselves finely. """"The White Squadron"""" will be seen at the Theatre Royal next week. One of the novel features will be a representation of the American Navy under sail and steam.

18850404,historical,ice,"Y, April 4, The situation in the Delaware at Callicoun is quite serious tonight. The river is rising rapidly tonight, backing upon Callicoun Creek, endangering the Erie Bridge. At 11 p.m. the river at Cochecton is breaking. The flats are covered with several feet of water, and no one dares to go near enough to find out the exact state of affairs. All residents on the flats escaped to higher ground. It is believed the gorge will hold for some time. Great excitement exists there. Leci HiVK, Pa, April 3, There is great anxiety here on account of the ice jam in the Susquehanna, which extends from the boom two miles above the city to Wethain, a distance of sixteen miles. All trains west on the P & E railroad have been held here since yesterday. Several miles of track are covered by ice and water. Fears are entertained for the safety of the railroad bridge at Queens Ban should the jam break. A heavy jam exists at Pine Creek, the water being up to the doors of the houses. Wilkes-Barre, Pa, April 3, The Susquehanna is now twenty-five feet above low water mark. The low lands on the west side from here to Kingston, nearly a mile wide, are submerged.

FLOODS AT ISLE PERROT: Considerable damage to property on Isle Perrot on account of flooding is reported by Mr. Louis Lesage, superintendent of the Montreal waterworks, who has returned to the city from a tour of inspection at the junction of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence rivers. The western portion of the island, for a distance of four miles long and a considerable width, had been completely inundated and all the houses and farms in that strip flooded. The first rise took place at midnight, on the 18th of February, when the worst storm of the season was at its height, the ice below the Cascade moving suddenly en bloc towards the island. Striking the shore it piled up in many places thirty feet high. The front was torn down from a large stone house where some fifty people, men and women, were assembled celebrating the feast of St. Valentine. They were all driven into the storm and made their escape through a perilous lake to some houses on an elevation about a mile away. All the stock in the stable, consisting of four head of cattle, a valuable horse and some smaller animals, were drowned in their stalls. The river continued to rise until by noon the next day all the people at that portion of the island were driven from their houses to find refuge on higher ground some distance off. About the 10th of last month the second rise took place, also in a heavy night storm. It came on suddenly, but the people were more prepared for it, and the loss was consequently not so serious. Numbers of cattle, however, perished, and the people, especially the sick, suffered much. The loss by both floods is estimated in aggregate at about $12,000. The people whose property has been damaged are said to be well off and it will not be necessary to adopt any measures for their relief. SNOWSTORM YESTERDAY: A heavy snowfall for April delayed trains. Yesterday the city and district were visited by a severe snowstorm which would have been more seasonable in January or February than in the month of April when people are anxiously looking out for the springtime. The snow fell heavily all day and vehicular and pedestrian traffic was impeded to a large extent. The streets were pretty much deserted and what with the war news and the storm business was very dull. The trains coming into and leaving the station were remarkably well on time. The Canada Atlantic, due from Ottawa at 11:35 a.m., was only thirty-five minutes behind. No. 4 east, due at 12:02 p.m., was twenty minutes late. The Delaware & Hudson and Central Vermont trains were on time. The western train due at eight in the morning was two hours late, the delay being through the alleged failure of other trains to connect west of Toronto. The drivers of all the trains report deep snow on the track in many places, especially south. Snowplows, however, were put into requisition throughout the night, and the track kept open. Some difficulty was experienced in moving the cars for the making-up of trains at the station early in the morning, the snow drifting on the shunting tracks nearly as fast as it could be removed, but all eventually went right through the energy of the station officials. The Canadian Pacific trains were also on time, the authorities announcing that the storm has not in any way interfered with the transport of the troops to the Northwest. The effects of the storm may most conspicuously be seen on the river opposite the city. The roads to St. Lambert, Laprairie and intermediate points are completely blotted out in places for some hundreds of yards distant, and their places filled up by snow-drifts many feet high. A motion was made for leave to appeal from a judgment dismissing a demurrer to a claim filed by the Cunard Steamship Company. The contestation of the application was on the ground that the Cunard Steamship Company had no interest whatever in the matter. It resulted from the opposition that the company had an interest in the claim, and the judgment was not one that deprived the party of any right which necessitated an appeal at this time. The motion for leave to appeal would be rejected. H. Tait et al., (plaintiffs below) appellants, and the defendant below, respondent. The case arose from a judgment dismissing the appellant's action. The facts were that in 1882 the respondents, who are contractors, resolved to tender for the construction of a cotton mill at Valleyfield, and they appointed a number of lumber merchants, including the appellants, to furnish them with statements of prices and qualities of wood required for the building. No precise amount was specified, but the approximate quantity was mentioned to the merchants, and price being obtained, a tender was put in by the respondents, and the contract was awarded to them. The appellants, on respondents' order, furnished lumber, and were paid for what they sent. The appellants complained by their action that the respondents had not purchased from them all the lumber mentioned in the approximate statement of quantities, but had obtained elsewhere part of what they required, and the sum of $1,039.91 was claimed as damages. The defense was that the respondents never bound themselves to take any specific quantity, and that they had got all they wanted from the appellants with the exception of a small quantity of a kind which the appellants were unable to furnish. The court below held that there was no contract for a specific quantity, and that the respondents got all they required from appellants with the exception of $39.99 worth which was bought from Henderson Brothers. The purchase from appellants amounted to $34,000, which was duly paid. Under the circumstances, the action was regarded as vexatious and was dismissed. H. Tait, J., dissenting, was of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed. The respondents asked for tenders, and the appellants' tender was accepted, and certain kinds of wood were taken, but not all that was required. The appellants sued the respondents for what they failed to gain by the contract, and in answer to this action it was pretended that the respondents took all that they required. The court below dismissed the action. The majority of this court appeared to be for confirming this judgment, not on the ground that an approximate quantity cannot be the subject of a contract, but because the tender had not been accepted. Now an acceptance may be implied as well as express. If a man calls for tenders, and accepts the articles tendered for, and pays for them at the prices given, it amounts to a contract. There could be no doubt that there was an acceptance in this case. The appellants should have judgment for at least $149, which amount of loss was clearly proved. H. Tait, J., concurred in the dissent. Cross, J., Hurteau et al., lumber merchants, sued Lawrence et al., builders, for the recovery of a sum of $1,039.91, which the former alleged the latter were bound to pay them by way of damages for having failed to accept and pay for a certain quantity of lumber which Hurteau et al. alleged Lawrence et al. had agreed to purchase from them. It appears that early in the year 1883 Lawrence et al. had obtained a contract to furnish the woodwork of an extensive cotton mill to be built at Valleyfield, in the County of Beauharnois, and had requested Hurteau et al. to give them prices at which they could furnish certain specified quantities and descriptions of timber of which it appears that a specification was furnished although it has not been produced. Thereupon Hurteau & Bro. wrote to L. & Bro. in the following terms: """"We have the honor to send prices for timber, etc., which we will sell you at the prices mentioned, hoping to be favored with your order, etc."""" There was no acceptance of this letter in whole or in part. Lawrence & Bro. afterwards during the progress of the work ordered from Lawrence & Bro. considerable quantities of lumber, in fact the principal part of the lumber by them required for the fulfillment of their contract, notes being given for each special order of lumber as received, which were paid at maturity. Towards the latter part of the work, not being able, according to what they say, to get a particular parcel of lumber from Hurteau & Bro. as fast as they required it, they gave an order to Henderson & Bro., Montreal, for some 16,328 feet, on which Hurteau & Bro. pretend they would have made $195.93, although Henderson & Bro. make out the difference between their purchase and that of Hurteau & Bro. to be only $122.46. Hurteau & Bro. pretend to be entitled to their profit on a much larger quantity, but have not succeeded in proving that Lawrence & Co. purchased any more of the like timber they expected to furnish from anyone else. When all the deliveries were made the accounts were made up, Lawrence & Co. closing Hurteau & Bro.'s account with a note. Hurteau & Co. up to that time made no additional demand, but on the account being closed they notified Lawrence & Bro. of the demand for which the present action has been brought. Lawrence & Co. defended the suit on the ground that they never made any contract with Hurteau & Co. for the whole of the timber they required; that they only inquired the prices at which they could procure the different descriptions of lumber, and gave special orders for the amounts they required from time to time, which they had a right to do from whomever they pleased, but voluntarily gave Hurteau & Bro. the advantage of furnishing the most of the timber they required, and would have given them the only remaining order given to Henderson had they been ready to fulfill it promptly, but they were not. The question at issue is whether there was an actually completed contract for the whole of the lumber closed between Hurteau & Frere and Lawrence & Frere. For this it of course required the concurrence of assent of both parties distinctly given to an undertaking on one side and an acceptance on the other. Now the letter of Hurteau & Frere is merely a specification of prices at which they were willing to furnish particular kinds of lumber, which was never accepted as a whole, and was only binding on Hurteau & Co. so long as it was not withdrawn. I cannot see how the requisition for any particular portion of the lumber contained in such an offer was in any respect a condition of the whole. Mo and Tussisa, J., concurred. Judgment confirmed, Harnsay and Baby, JJ., dissenting. Present: Chief Justice Dorion, and Justices Monk, Cross and Baby. Likd et al. (defendants below), appellants, and Davyso (plaintiff below), respondent; and C. Cross, J. This action was brought by the owner of the steamship Whickham against the charterers to recover £100 sterling for demurrage and £13 for dead freight on a voyage for which the vessel was chartered from the port of Montreal to a port in Europe to be indicated by the charterers. The Superior Court gave the ship owner judgment for the dead freight, but denied his right to the demurrage. Both parties have appealed. The charter is dated at Montreal from October, 1882. The ship, of the capacity of 1,121 tons, was then on its way from Burrow to England to the port of Montreal. The material provisions of the charter were that the ship should proceed to Montreal, and there load full and complete cargoes of grain or in part flour at rates specified in the charter for the different kinds of grain or flour that might be loaded, and having loaded should therewith proceed to a safe port in the United Kingdom, or a safe port on the Continent, calling at certain ports indicated, for orders, and to deliver her cargo at the port indicated. Ten running days to be allowed the merchant charterer for discharging commencing from the time of the ship being ready to deliver cargo. Ship to be loaded as fast as can be received in fine weather, and ten days on demurrage over and above the said lying days at forty pounds per day. The ship to have an absolute lien on the cargo for all freight, dead freight and demurrage due under this charter until the charterer remains responsible to ensure that the shipment of the cargo be worth the freight, demurrage, etc., on arrival at the port of discharge. Should ice set in during loading to endanger the ship the master to be at liberty to sail with part cargo and to have leave to call up at any open port on the way homeward for the ship's benefit. The steamer arrived at the port of Montreal on the 11th of November, 1882, and before noon on the 12th of November was ready to receive cargo, whereof notice was given to the shippers, accompanied by the necessary certificate of the port authorities. She received cargo up to the morning of the 21st, when she left having previously on the 20th by a note from the captain intimated to the charterers that on account of the threatening state of the weather and ice beginning to set in he had decided for the safety of his vessel to start the following morning the 22nd of November, thus availing himself of the privilege reserved in the charter to sail with part cargo in case of anticipated danger from ice forming. On the 15th of November the master of the steamer had a protest served on the charterers, in which it was asserted that the lay days commenced at noon on the 15th; he complained that no cargo had yet been shipped up to noon on the 16th, and protested for damages, etc. A like protest was served on the 18th complaining of insufficient diligence, but admitting that there was half a day of unsuitable weather for loading. The charterers defended themselves, alleging that by the custom of the port they were not bound to commence loading until noon on the 15th, nor at night nor in bad weather nor on Sundays; that they did extra diligence, working at night and in part of the bad weather and part of Sunday, but were interrupted by the master refusing to proceed on the afternoon of the 17th from apprehended danger to his vessel, loading too much into the forehold without a counterbalance in the other parts of the vessel, and by the fault of the master in not procuring a sufficient number of baggers to receive the grain into bags and have them prepared by sewing to be stowed away; that their extra diligence more than made up for any pretended loss of time. The proof made as regards diligence is contradictory, but on the whole leaves the impression that by the fault of the shippers the vessel may have been delayed two days at most, assuming that the shippers should have been ready at noon on the 15th. When the vessel left there was grain alongside sufficient to complete her cargo. It is satisfactorily established that ice was forming so as to endanger the vessel, and that she left at the very latest time she could have remained with safety. No serious question arises as to the quantum of dead freight claimed if it is to be allowed. The judgment of the Superior Court appealed from allows the dead freight in full, but refuses the demurrage or damages for delay in loading. As I read the charter the demurrage was expressly appended to the clause providing for the loading of the vessel as fast as could be received in fine weather, and so intimately connected with it that the two cannot be separated in the construction, and the ten days here given are in addition to the ten running days to discharge. """"As fast as can be received in fine weather"""" was inserted for the benefit of the ship as much as that of the shipper, it admits of a measure as to time, and in this respect differs from the clause in question in the case of Lockhart vs. Fulk, 10 L. It, Exch, 132, relied on by the ship where the provision was to load in the customary manner, language giving no indication of a measure of delay, besides the ship is estopped from maintaining that there are no lay days at the port of loading, because in his protest of the 16th of November, he expressly declared that lay days commenced at noon on the 15th of November, and in the protest of the 18th he declared that the vessel was to be loaded as fast as could be received in fine weather, and demurrage was stipulated at the rate of forty pounds per day, indicating clearly that he relied upon the demurrage clause as applicable to the loading of the vessel at the port of Montreal, and basing his claim thereon. Again, when he sailed his pretensions were contradictory of any claim for dead freight, he availed himself of his reserved privilege to sail without full cargo, having already asserted his claims. The question now at issue was not that in Lockhart vs. Falk; it was only the application and effect of the cesser of liability clause that was there in question, and without the exact language of the charter party in that case it would be impossible to judge whether it afforded a parallel to the present as to the application of the provision for demurrage. Again, suppose that the provision for demurrage is inapplicable, does it follow that the ship would have a right to the whole dead freight? If there had been no danger from ice getting in, would the ship have been entitled to leave the port of loading and claim for dead freight because she had been detained two days or longer? Were such damages under such circumstances in the contemplation of the parties to this contract? I should say that the shipowner neither contemplated them nor claimed them until by an afterthought he claimed them by this action. The setting in of frost to interrupt navigation exonerates a carrier from diligence in delivery, and the same reason would exonerate a shipper from the delivery of a cargo that could not be transported. True, it has been ruled in the English cases that a frost which delays or prevents the loading does not excuse the freighter, but if it occurs when the ship has been loaded the ship bears the loss; it would be the same if the freighter, as in this case, had the goods to load but the ship refused to receive them. It might have turned out that the captain was unnecessarily alarmed, and that there would have been ample time to get out with safety. A like uncertain event cannot be made the measure of damage. The privilege which the ship-owner in this case reserved to avoid detention was one stipulated for to be availed of in his own interest, for his own benefit, at his own risk and profit, and so far from its entitling him to dead freight, it operated as an express renunciation of such a claim, and provided that he would have in lieu thereof what freight he could earn by calling at any open port or ports on the homeward voyage. In my opinion the principal appeal should be allowed and the shipowners' action for dead freight dismissed. I would allow the cross appeal and give the ship-owner judgment for damages for two days' detention. The cesser of liability clause was urged in agreement and might have been a sufficient defense, but as it had not been pleaded it could not be applied. It is probable that it had been waived as a ground of defense. Dos, C. J., for the majority of the court. The question was whether the ship owner was entitled to damages or to demurrage. If he was entitled to damages they went as assessed at all amounts not to be distinguished. If, on the contrary, the shipowner was only entitled to demurrage, then the demurrage would be at most only £100, while the judgment was for £1,000. Demurrage was the sum to be paid for delays or detention beyond the fixed number of days for either loading or unloading. His honor was of the opinion that it was damages that the party was entitled to, and not demurrage. The judge in the court below held that he was entitled to £1,000. Perhaps this sum was a little too much, but this was corrected by the allowance for time of loading. The pretension that the time was made up by loading all night could not be sustained because the damages were incurred every day that the ship was delayed. The freighter had no claim for the extra work, for he did it in his own interest. If he had not performed that extra work the damages that he would have had to pay would be greater; it was to reduce the damage that he worked at night. The amount that he put into the vessel that less would be his damages. It was said that the ten days applied to the loading as well as to the unloading. His Honor thought not. Upon the whole case he had come to the conclusion that the damages had been properly allowed, and were not excessive. The result would be that both appeals should be dismissed. Muir, J., concurred with reluctance in a judgment awarding so large an amount of damages. Judgment confirmed, Cross, J., dissenting.",
18980321,historical,ice,"THE WEST END SHOULD HOLD THE CHAMPIONSHIP To the Sporting Editor of The Gazette, Sir, I beg to enclose a copy of the schedule of the District Junior League, with the results and score of each match, so far as it can be given. On January 15, Le Montagnard vs. St. Lambert. Le Montagnard protested this game because St. Lambert played men who were not eligible for this league. To settle matters, St. Lambert proposed that this match be left as it is, but in case it interfered with the championship in any way, it must be played over. This proposition was accepted. On January 22, West End went to Is it the season for new life in nature, new vigor in our physical systems?

On February 9, West End vs. Le Montagnard. This game was to be played from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. During the time, as the captain of the Le Montagnard team did not appear until 7:10, there was just 60 minutes left. The time was to be divided into two halves after deducting for 10 minutes' rest. After time was up, the score was 1 to 1, and was so declared by the referee, and as no proposition was made by either club for a play-off, this matter stood as it was. On February 12, St. Lambert had withdrawn from the league. On March 8, Walbay vs. SOME CELLARS ARE FLOODED. Proprietors in Threatened Districts Take Precautions in Time and Remove Property to Places of Safety. Thousands of people were attracted to the riverfront yesterday and the procession continued up to a late hour last night. There was not much to be seen, however. Although the water reached up to a level of two feet eight inches in the woodwork of the dyke, its motion was so gradual and so quiet that there was nothing in it to arouse any unusual excitement. The water attained its highest point (about 7 o'clock last night), but shortly after that time, it began to fall, and went down so steadily that old-timers gave out the opinion with considerable assurance that all danger of a serious overflow had passed. Still, there was a chance. So long as the water remained above the level of the dyke woodwork, it was thought that in the event of an ice shove taking place, the weak structure of the dyke, worn by a much longer use than it had originally been intended for, would not be able to stand it. This served to keep alive a feeling of suspense among those who had come to watch the rise and fall of the water. As it was not known at what minute the ice would come down from Lake St. Louis and precipitate a flood, in spite of the promising aspect of Commissioners Street, except in places where the ramps had been rather hurriedly erected, showed no signs of overflow. At the foot of St. Sulplce, St. Gabriel, St. Francois Xavier and McGill streets, however, especially in the latter locality, considerable water had come through the ramp structure, and the street was slightly overflowed in these places. The ramps near the foot of McGill Street showed more leakage than the rest because the barricading of these places was not finished until a late hour last night. During the early evening, a large number of men were engaged in filling these structures, canvas bags filled with clay, straw and cement being used for the purpose. When finished, these ramps gave promise of being as dry as the others and even the slight overflow which was going on would be stopped. Any damage which threatened along the riverfront and elsewhere resulted largely from water flowing out of the yards, but comparatively few places of flooded cellars were reported. Merchants, however, had taken the precaution on the breaking up of the river to remove all their damageable goods from the basement to places of safety, in the event of an overflow, and nothing remained for them to do yesterday but to calmly await developments. In the vicinity of Hochelaga, where the buildings are not protected by any earthwork, some small dwellings were more or less injured by ice and water. It was stated that the basement of the lower cotton factory had been overflowed, but it was not expected that the damage would be great, as the more expensive machinery is on the upper flats, and the water did not reach the more damageable portion of the machinery which was in that department. On Marlborough Street, the water invaded a small house, and the inmates were obliged to make rather a hasty exit with their furniture. In the western section of the city, the water also played considerable havoc although no material damage was reported. Ogilvie's mills were flooded in the basement and large gangs of men were employed on Friday and Saturday in getting the goods to the upper part of the building. In one place the water came completely over Mill Street and flowed up against the walls of the buildings at that point. General precautions seem to have been taken throughout the city in places where an overflow from the sewers might have been expected to remove property from the basements. The Grand Trunk Railway applied themselves energetically on Saturday to removing the freight from their Bonaventure sheds, the men working all night through. The goods were checked and placed aboard the cars and shipped. In cases of light freight where it was inconvenient to have it removed, the goods were piled up on scaffolding out of reach of any possible flood that may come. The fact that the water began to fall after 7 o'clock did not seem to reassure everybody among the many who had opinions to offer regarding the possibilities of a flood. There were some who recalled the incident which may be true or otherwise, of the big flood of 1888, that the water had fallen in a similar way immediately before the ice shove which had brought such a disastrous deluge on the city. If opinions are good for anything, one man is entitled to as much respect as another in this regard, and some of the policemen of No. 15 station, who were on the spot at the time of the overflow of 1888, expressed themselves last night to the effect that there was no danger of a flood taking place at the present time. Whatever may be said against the old wooden structure called the dyke, it has staunchly befriended Montreal in the present issue, and it was given some work to do too. At one time last night the water was nearly three feet above its lowest part and although it had no severe shove to contend against, it did its work satisfactorily in keeping out the tons and tons of water, which, but for it, would have swept Commissioners Street and its traffic temporarily out of existence. In fact, the old walls seemed to be fluid there. Some tried to detract from the work it was doing by saying that it was frozen to the ground, and could not move if it would. But there is nobody who would not be willing to sing the praises of the tumbledown old structure which, despite its years and decaying condition, kept the city free from the water which was seeking to break upon its front. At the same time, with the past in view and the future in prospect, it must have occurred as a natural suggestion to the thousands who have visited the harbor front during the past two days that the time has come when the old breakwater should be laid to rest and that Montreal should be protected by a wall of a permanent character, which would not only protect it against floods from the river, but create a structure which the city could look upon as befitting its commercial position. Just how long the present condition of things in the river will obtain is, of course, a question open to conjecture. It is quite possible that the water will keep on rising and falling for a considerable time without doing any serious damage. Mr. John Kennedy, chief engineer of the Harbor Board, speaking to a Gazette reporter last night, said that the water had reached its greatest height and would now recede. He did not believe that there would be any flood, and even if the Lake St. Louis ice did come down, at the present time, it would not make any difference. Mr. Kennedy also stated that the harbor fleet, which is moored in the harbor, was quite safe. Matters looked serious early on Sunday morning that some merchants who did not anticipate trouble with the water coming up so far were quite alive to the fact, now that work must be done at once, and quickly, too, although it was Sunday. One firm was that of Thomas Samuel & Son, who had a staff of men at work soon after seven o'clock, removing their large and valuable stock to upper flats. Mr. Samuel said, """"The old saying is 'better to be sure than sorry,' and we will have a good rest tonight, knowing that all is now high and dry."""" Men were very willing to assist those anxious to remove goods in all parts, some working all Saturday night and part of Sunday. Gault Bros. Co., Ltd. and Toke Bros., at the corner of Collet and St. Helen streets, also took the precaution to remove their large stocks of dry goods, shirts, collars, etc., on Saturday to upper floors. On St. Paul Street, most merchants from McGill Street to Bonsecours Market have taken all goods from their cellars, some at great inconvenience. As one merchant remarked: """"The insurance people should get out policies next season against damage by flood."""" LOUIS ICE, Pointe Claire, Que., March 20. The ice opposite here moved a little today. There are now two large openings, one off Chateauguay and the other near the point off Isle Perrot. SOME SUBURBS STRIPPED. The good people of Maisonneuve and Longueuil shared in the general alarm, and at midnight on Saturday got a rather alarming scare. About this hour the water rose with alarming rapidity, and in a few minutes thereafter there was a panic which only lasted for a few minutes, as the water commenced to recede. There was destruction, however, for in front of the Protestant House of Industry Home for the aged, some three telegraph poles were wrenched from their base and badly smashed. In the afternoon, about four o'clock, there was another shove which brought the water on the roadway and sent the occupants of the dwellings along the road in quest of the contents of their cellars. There was not much to destroy as the contents had been wisely removed. True, the situation is, however, a very serious one. Two miles below the village of Longue Pointe, there is concentrated enough ice to flood all the lower part of the city and if it does not break up before today, there is every probability of a repetition of the scenes and incidents of 1886 and 1887. In conversation with a Gazette reporter last night, the people did not express any fears of a real flood. They, at least, the majority of them, had from two to three feet of water in their cellars or basements, but a small thing like that may not dishearten them. Any little damage that was done yesterday did not amount to more than $300 or $400 which is fully covered by insurance. The scene along the Longue Pointe road was interesting during the afternoon; along the banks the hillocks of ice and frozen snow lent a weird aspect to a scene, although not unusual, was very attractive. Down the river, Longueuil, Que., March 20. The town is flooded, and a great deal of damage has resulted. The waterworks are flooded and the local sawmill collapsed today. Pierreville, Que., March 20. The ice at this point is still strong, and a number of horses have crossed today. Sorel, Que., March 20. The Richelieu River is clear of ice as far as three miles above St. Ours. It is expected that the Richelieu River will be completely clear of ice on Monday. St. Lawrence River ice still firm. Three Rivers, March 19. There is as yet very little change noticeable in the ice, which still holds firm. The Flood at Richmond. Richmond and vicinity suffered considerably from the high water in the St. Francis. The covered wooden bridge over the river at Windsor was carried away. It was about 800 feet long, and cost $14,000. It was owned by a joint-stock company, the municipality of Windsor and Windsor-Mills being the principal stockholders. To reduce danger to the bridges lower down, the debris was set on fire. The relief was not sufficient, however, and one pier of the iron bridge at Richmond gave way, causing one span to fall and shoving another one out of position. The St. Francis Bridge Company will be heavy losers, and for a few months great inconvenience will be experienced by the public who had occasion to pass to and fro between the two sides of the river for many miles on either side of the two places. Some minor damage was done to buildings. CHETAN GOVERNORSHIP, Sultan Prevailed Upon to Accept. Prince George, Constantinople, March 19. In consequence of the Sultan's direct appeal, the Czar has consented to withdraw his demand for the $750,000 arrears of the Russo-Turkish war indemnity, which His Majesty at first insisted should be paid from the Greco-Turkish war indemnity. This fact, it is alleged, foreshadows Turkey's acceptance of Prince George of Greece, the candidate of the Czar, as governor of the island of Crete.",
18841107,historical,ice,"61 TFIRINO AT LITTLE METIS, Little Metis, November 6 A most severe snow and windstorm visited this coast yesterday, clearing everything in its way. All the houses along the shore have been carried off, also boats, fences, bridges, etc. The shore today is strewn with debris and household effects. The suffering will be intense from cold and hunger to those left destitute. L'Islet flooded, L'Islet, November 6 The damage by yesterday's storm is considerable, amounting to nearly $7,000. All the principal streets and shops in all quarters of the village were flooded, some merchants losing heavily. All the wharves have been more or less damaged. The pavements in the streets have floated off. The whole village is in a very dilapidated condition. AT IIATAM AND TADOUSAC, Matank, November 6 The storm of yesterday was the most severe that has been felt for many years past. The tide rose upwards of two feet over the ordinary November spring tides. Two parts of the Prince Bros & Co. wharf were carried away and quite a number of deals floated out. Several persons here were obliged to abandon their houses. The damage will be about $3,000. Tadoussac, Que, November 6 The wharf at this place and other property have been considerably damaged by yesterday's cyclone. It is stated that there has not been so severe a storm for the past fifty years. The damage cannot be estimated at present. St. Thomas (Montmagny), November 6 The most severe snow and windstorm that has ever visited this town commenced yesterday afternoon and continued during the whole night. Considerable damage was done to the breakwater by the high tides. Ice is forming here very quickly. Car Rocs, Que, November 6 The steamer Champion, with five schooners in tow, bound for Quebec, put in here for shelter last night. One of her tows was cast adrift. The market steamers Etoile and St. Louis, with about 200 passengers on board, had also to seek shelter here, a most violent hurricane blowing. The tide rose about four feet above the normal spring tide mark, accompanied by a mild cyclone and snowstorm which lashed the waters into a fury. Part of the village was inundated; damage light. Two feet of snow had fallen this morning. Sleighing is excellent and the weather cold. FASRIVA, LC, November 6 Yesterday afternoon, at a point about three and a half miles east of Bic station, on the Intercolonial railway, the road of the Intercolonial for a distance of about a hundred feet was washed away by the extraordinary high tide. The damage was luckily discovered before the eastbound express reached Bic, and it was stopped at the station. A special train was then brought from Campbellton, with the intention of having the passengers and mails from the express train carted across the dangerous section, it being evident that the track could not be made passable for many hours. Unfortunately, about a mile east of the first was another and far worse washout, the lower part of the road for about three hundred feet having been swept away, but there was nothing on the surface to denote that such was the result of a previous washout. The engines and two cars jolted over the place safely, but the remaining cars of the train careened into the river. A brakeman named Perrin and a telegraph repairer named Lefrere were injured, neither seriously. A gang of men immediately set about building a temporary trestle, while another gang bored the track inward at the western washout. About two this afternoon both places were fit to traverse, and the express train, after its long delay, pursued its way eastward in safety. A Htbvkssos spoke of the interest and attractiveness of the curling last year, and stated that a deputation from the curling clubs would meet the committee with a view of providing matches during carnival week, to be advertised on the programme. All present seemed desirous of meeting such a proposal by offering prizes for contests. As soon as possible a sketch programme of the carnival will be issued and sent broadcast throughout America. The secretary was instructed to apply to the chairman and members of the road committee for Dominion Square as a site for the ice palace. It was unanimously desired that Mr. DOMINION The water famine still continues at Quebec and prices have gone up to $2.00 a barrel. General Middleton inspected the Queen's Own and Royal Grenadier at Toronto yesterday. Two feet of snow fell during Wednesday night's storm in some of the lower St. Lawrence districts, and ice is reported to be forming on the river. The damage to shipping by the gale in the gulf and the high tides does not appear to be serious, only three schooners being reported ashore. At Quebec, the loss to merchants by the flooding of their stores is stated at over $200,000. Two men who went out at Father Point with a pilot were washed out of their boat and drowned. Several football matches were played by Montrealers yesterday, the most important being that at Toronto, when the Montreal club defeated the Toronto champions of Ontario, and are now therefore champions of the Dominion. The Montreal second fifteen played the Ottawa college team at Ottawa, resulting in a draw in favor of our boys. The Britannia also played the Ottawa club, the first fifteen winning by 31 points to 2; and the second fifteen by 13 to 7. A match played between No. 2 Co. and No. 5 Co. of the Victoria Rifles was won by the latter by 6 points to 2.",
18960101,historical,ice,"W. Campbell and another physician, Dr. Davidson, were on board the train and they attended to the man's injuries. These were of a most serious nature. The right arm was broken in two places; the left arm was broken, and there were also severe internal injuries. These were attended to as well as possible under the circumstances. The General Hospital ambulance was telephoned for, and met the train on arrival at the Bonaventure Station. The man was conveyed to the hospital, where he now lies in a precarious condition. His escape from drowning was a most miraculous one. Joseph Jimnet is a man of about 40 years of age, residing at No. 113 Quesnel street, Ste. Curie-gonde, and is married, with several children. Yesterday's terrific gale had a very marked effect on the river opposite the city. The ice, which had formed between the wharves and the Guard Pier, was completely honeycombed by the deluge of rain of the early morning, and large fields of ice were carried out by the force of the wind. As a result of the hurricane, the city supply of water was rendered very dirty in appearance, and, during the day, was anything but an inviting beverage. In many places along the wharves the ice and snow have entirely disappeared, and are, in places, as bare as in summer. The Harbor Commissioners' fleet of dredges, etc., which are moored at the foot of the canal, did not suffer any material damage from the fury of the storm. IN THE HEART OF THE CITY Saturday's wind storm was certainly one to be remembered in Montreal, and its severity has not been equalled in the city for many years. On Monday evening the storm was brewing, and gaining strength every hour. The pelting rain and uncomfortable atmosphere made it an unpleasant night to be outdoors. As the wind strengthened, towards the early morning hours, the rain ceased. From about one o'clock in the morning until about twelve noon yesterday, the storm was at its height. The gale howled through the trees, whistled down the chimneys and the windows ominously. By the morning all hopes that the gale would quickly subside were dispelled. Instead, the wind kept on increasing, and the greater part of the damage was done between the hours of eight and eleven o'clock in the morning. The most disastrous effect was noticed upon McGill street, which had a most demoralized appearance. Some fifteen of the gigantic telegraph poles were blown over; in front of the St. Ann's market alone, there were seven of the massive poles snapped in twain. Traffic was completely blocked all afternoon, from the market to the Albion Hotel; in many cases, parts of the broken poles and tops hung on the mass of wires and threatened to fall every moment and crush the number of men working below. It took some time to clear away the mass of wreckage, and tangled and broken wires, although a great many men were working. It seemed miraculous that no fatal accident had occurred on this busy thoroughfare. The huge poles, lying on the ground, completely blocked the way; the wires, glass and huge splinters made the sidewalks almost impassable. The iron swinging beams of the electric light also lay scattered around, broken into many pieces. At the corners of McGill and Wellington streets two poles had been snapped in two and destroyed. Looking up the street the scene was like that often seen after a fire. In one of the large wholesale warehouses on McGill street, the front door, with large glass windows, had been completely blown in and the glass shattered to atoms. In other places there were poles that looked as if very little would bowl them over, too, and some had the appearance of snapping at the base. Several other streets were affected to a less extent. On Cathedral street, where the wind has a fine sweep from Dominion Square, a good deal of damage was done to the telegraph poles. Just below St. Antoine street one had snapped in two, and the upper part had crashed onto the roof of a dwelling house, effecting considerable damage. At the corner of St. Antoine street, again, there were two poles broken in two, while, looking up the street, others were noticed in a very precarious position, leaning to one side and supported by ropes. Here and there, along the other streets, a pole or fence is noticed down, but no real heavy damage was done. The huge piles were blown down, and the tracks scattered like so many feathers. During the morning the employees in the top storey of the Canada Jute Company's Building, on St. Martin street, below William, had a great scare. Without very much warning, the entire roof seemed to come away and gently deposit itself in a lane at the rear. This was rather too much for the women employees, who decamped in a great hurry. The buildings of the Montreal Ice Exchange in the immediate vicinity also experienced considerable damage. One side and end of one of the old buildings caved in, but no one was hurt. The small building standing by itself at the western corner of Chaboillez square and Notre Dame street was considerably damaged. Part of the roof was blown off. In Westmount there are several cases reported where roofs have been hurled into adjoining yards. A small conservatory was also taken up bodily and placed in an adjoining field, to the complete demolishing of both conservatory and contents. No accidents are reported within the town. RACKET CLUB Results of the """"Blind"""" Handcap-Read Weather for Curlers Turf and General Sporting. The Shamrock Hockey Team will have its first opportunity of proving to the hockeyites what measure of strength it has, and to what extent it may be relied upon in the future, when its forces will meet the great Ottawa combination on the ice at the Crystal Rink on Saturday evening next, in a tussle for the championship. The visitors have at the opening of the season demonstrated most effectively, by the defeat they administered to the Victorias, that they are going to create no mere everyday kind of excitement in the coming season of the championship, and, as a consequence, the match on Saturday is arousing a very keen feeling of excitement amongst the hockey people. The Shamrocks will put a splendid team on the ice, and Stephens, who has just returned from Quebec, will be in his old place. The forwards will be the same as last year, with the exception of the late Willie Fairbairn, whose place will be filled by that level-headed and fleet skater, Sammy Lee. The position of cover-point is to be filled by a new man from the Morrisburghs, and those who have seen him play at the Beaver Rink last winter, unite in saying that he is a coming man, and, in the meantime, will serve the purpose of forming a formidable stonewall behind the advance sharpshooters of the team. Hob Wall is now in fine form, and from present appearances, he is going to be a prominent figure in hockey this season, as he has had quite a rest since the close of the lacrosse season, and says himself, that he never started out like a season worn in the same spirit as at present. Dave Brown, the man who takes more hard knocks and covers more ice than most of the players, is again to the front, and will do more good work, while Drysdale, White, Dwyer, Fyfe, Dobby and a number of others are standing in the rank and file to give the executive an opportunity of testing their power of discrimination in making selections for a place, and which will, no doubt, be the cause of a good deal of that kind of debating, which usually winds up by a protest from the proprietor who has to pay the gas bill. The Shamrocks have decided to renew the good arrangements of last year, when the final match of the season was played with the Victorias. Special reserved seats with ushers will be provided, and every possible attention will be paid to spectators. The Shamrock executive are bound to keep up the reputation they earned last season for the accommodation of the public. Victorias and Montreal Will Meet on Friday. The opening hockey match of the season for the championship will be played in the Victoria Rink on Friday next. A great deal depends on this match, as both clubs calculate that a defeat in the early part of the season means a great deal. It should prove a most exciting match, and, no doubt, it will be well attended. GOLF AS A PASTIME The Game In the West, but New York the Virtual Centre. Columbus Dispatch. Judging from the way golf has risen in the West, during the past year, it is more than likely Columbus will be seen in the field during the season of 1896. Golf has evidently established itself as a fixture in this portion of the world. Chicago boasts of no fewer than four clubs, the first of which, the Chicago Golf Club, was established two years ago, with a membership of only 20. This same club now boasts of 171 names upon its list. The Onwentensia, formerly the Lake Forest Club, has a roster of nine hundred or so. Both the Riverside and Illinois Clubs are yet young organizations, but they are counting upon large accessions in the spring. As to their ability, it is said that not fewer than a dozen men in their ranks entitle them to be classed with the top notchers in Eastern circles. New York is the virtual centre of golf, both in the number of matches played this year and in the quality of games. The season's work has been highly gratifying, although 1895 may be classed as the first practical season of the great society fad. That the game has come to stay is evidenced by the rapid accumulation of club revenues and property by the various golf clubs in existence. The Shinnecock Club, near New York, now owns 210 acres, and the club house has been twice enlarged. The Chicago Club has 200 acres, not over twenty miles from the city, and proposes to expend $60,000 next season in enlarging and beautifying its present quarters. The Lake Forest Club, which has recently changed its name to Onwentensia (the Indian for """"Kenton""""), has recently built a new club house, all at an expense of $75,000. Other clubs throughout the country are similarly situated, the latest being the new club at Ardsley, which contemplates expending over a quarter of a million dollars upon its site in 1896. Its club house at Newport is the finest to be found anywhere. While the size of the figures presented above means a heavy expense in the way of interest charges, it also demonstrates that a high rate of dues is to be kept up, and that golf, as it is played by the better element of society, must be classed as one of the luxuries of life. The game requires a large extent of territory upon which to play, and the cost of keeping the grounds in perfect condition is, by no means, inconsiderable. Still, this is our American way of doing things. We may be laughed at by our Scottish and English friends, but we have one thing in our favor: the sport of this country is confined to that class of society amateurs who do not seek to pattern by the foreign standard, but content themselves with the fact that they will have all the very best golfing advantages that enthusiasm can create or money can buy, at the same time taking into consideration the fact that it is not the position of the ball, but the man behind it that scores the winner. From the above it may be inferred that golfing is confined to the exclusive set, and not for people to be found in the ordinary walks of life. Such, however, is not the case. Golf is for the masses. The size of the exchequer is not to be computed, and it was never intended to turn the game into a """"shibboleth of snobbishness,"""" as one writer states. In the home of its nativity it is one of the most democratic of sports, and while there are plenty of """"swell private clubs"""" to be found, they are greatly outnumbered by the public courses, and, I may add, there are even courses for the workingman. There are opportunities in abundance for all who wish to play the game. The sport is the main object in view, so let us hope that these few remarks may serve as a beginning to encourage the great game in this city. The Dispatch will be ever ready to assist in carrying out the idea of making the sport popular and lasting among the masses. Golf should prove a welcome addition to our list of college sports and the formation of an intercollegiate Ohio association would meet with hearty support. Flood at St. Raymond. St. Raymond, Que., December 31. The river St. Anne is in flood at St. Raymond. The ice has jammed near the railway bridge, causing the water to flood the village. Several inhabitants had to move in boats to higher ground, on account of having from six to ten inches of water on the floors of their houses. The river bed is apparently taking another direction. The flat between the River St. Anne and the north branch is mostly all covered with water and floating ice. The land is cut to a large extent in several places, and about fifty feet of land has been washed away near the cemetery. The river has begun falling tonight, and cold weather is setting in. The damage is as yet unknown. Argentina Will Retort. Buenos Aires, December 31. It is said that the Senate has decided to impose light duties on all American products brought into Argentina if the United States reimpose a tariff duty on wool. Congress has passed a bill authorizing an issue of Government bonds for the purpose of paying the railroad guarantees. Four Children Burned to Death. Pittsburgh, Pa., December 31. By the burning of a small dwelling, last night, in the mining town of Frontrun, four boys, Hubert, Will, John and Archie McTavish, aged 1, 10, 11 and 14, lost their lives. CUSTOMS, December 31. The Customs receipts at the port of St. John for December show a decline of $3,605, compared with the same period last year, and the Inland Revenue receipts decreased about $7,000. Twenty-one steamers from foreign ports and forty-five coasting steamers arrived at St. John during December. The barque Pulchre and barquentine Primrose both cleared today for Buenos Ayres, with spruce lumber. Some time ago, a half-yearly dividend of 6 percent on the capital stock of the Bank of New Brunswick was announced. This morning the directors found that the funds were in such a healthy state they were able, in addition, to carry $5,000 to the rest, which is now brought up to $30,000. Today's gale was very severe along the crest. Signs and chimneys were blown down in various parts of the city. There is a large ice jam on the St. John river, about twelve miles above Fredericton, and as last night's rain swelled the river considerably, fears are felt for the safety of the two Fredericton bridges, in event of the jam breaking. Fourteen carloads of American grain arrived today, for shipment to England, and sixteen thousand bags of flour are now en route from Minneapolis. ICE IN THE HARBOR. Louis Cost Takes Issue with the Views of MP Kennedy-Pilotage Matters. At the weekly meeting of the Harbor Commissioners, yesterday, a petition from the Montreal pilots was received, asking that article 126 of the by-laws be modified so that the suspension of a pilot would only date from the day that judgment was rendered, instead of, as at present, from the happening of the accident; requesting representation on the Board of Harbor Commissioners when sitting as pilotage authority, and, also, that the tariff of pilotage fees be increased by 50 cents per foot for all vessels of from 2,000 tons to 2,500 tons, and $1 per foot on vessels measuring over 2,500 tons. The petition was referred to the Commissioners Committee on Pilots, Deacons and Lighters to consider and report. A letter was received from the secretary of the Montreal Bridge Company submitting a plan of the site upon which the company proposes to build the bridge which they are authorized to construct across the River St. Lawrence, and asking modifications as to the placing of the piers on both sides of the St. Mary's current, which was referred to the Chief Engineer for report. Tenders for timbers and planks for 1898, to the number of 17, were opened, and referred to the Chief Engineer for tabulation and report at next meeting. After discussion of a report from the Chief Engineer, the following resolution was passed with reference to the supply of fine-dressing stone for 1896: """"That the Chief Engineer be instructed to take out say 330 tons of stone by men regularly employed on the works as has been done in the past, 80 tons to be taken from the jail."""" The following letter was received from the Chief Engineer of the Department of Public Works: Department of Public Works of Canada, Chief Engineer's Office, Ottawa, 28th December, 1895. J. H. Buhner, Esq., Chairman Harbor Commissioners, Montreal: On the 18th instant I received from the Secretary of the Harbor Commissioners of Montreal, a copy of a report by Mr. Kennedy in connection with the movement of the ice in the basin within the Guard Pier. I was so astonished that Mr. Kennedy should so early in the winter arrive at the conclusion that the opening of 1,000 feet between the upper end of the Guard Pier and the Victoria Bridge abutment was too wide to give immunity from ice shoves inside the pier, and I immediately left for Montreal, where I remained two days (the 19th and 20th), investigating the statement made by your Chief Engineer. I am bound to admit, however, that I was unable to see any ice shove in the basin within the Guard Pier, and I cannot, therefore, understand what can have prompted Mr. Kennedy to report as he has done. It is quite true that the large field of ice within the basin cracked and moved bodily downwards some 25 feet, but I see nothing strange in that occurrence. Anyone can conceive that such a large surface of thin ice, when lifted 7 or 8 feet in a few hours, must, of necessity, crack, and then the movement downwards is easy to explain. The ice moved when it got above the wharves, until it butted against the main revetment wall of the Harbor. The conclusion of Mr. Kennedy's report is certainly not warranted by the facts, and his pessimistic views are not shared by me. I have never denied the possibility of some ice being shoved in the spring into the Windmill Basin through the 1,000 feet opening, but I have stated that, in my opinion, there was no danger of ice being shoved into that part of the Harbor below the Lachine Locks, and within the Guard Pier, unless the Guard Pier itself was carried away. Further, I have always insisted that the benefits to be derived by the opening were so great that the Commissioners were fully warranted in fully trying the experiment of not building the Guard Pier as far as the Victoria Bridge. Mr. Kennedy knows well that he could not have added one foot to the Guard Pier last autumn, and that, therefore, the opening was bound to remain during the present winter, affording him an excellent opportunity to study the movement of the ice next spring, and to ascertain the extent of the damage that ice shoves will make. Louis Coktk, Chief Engineer. FINANCE COMMITTEE Closing out the Year's Business A Number of Claims and Accounts Settled.

THE RECENT FLOODS Serious Loss on the South Shore-Lighthouses and Plant Damaged-But of the City. A walk through the recently flooded districts of the city yesterday showed the various proprietors and tenants rapidly repairing the damage to their property. The various shops are announcing cheap sales of damaged goods. In the streets were found stranded sidewalks, and the corporation workmen were busy repairing the other ones. In some places there was a most disgusting stench from the sewage matter deposit. The Health department has sent a supply of chloride of lime and quick lime to the following stations: No. 1, Point St. Charles; No. 7, Young street; No. 8, Seigneurs street; and to the fire station, Chuchillcz square. The poor can obtain what they require on application at these depots. The chloride of lime is intended for throwing into privies and sprinkling on the floors of cellars and into the gutters in front of the houses, and the quick lime for whitewashing fences and cellar walls, etc. The Rev. Father Tiche, cure of Lachine, has forwarded 4 loaves to the Rev. cure of Laprairie, for distribution among the poor of his village who have recently been flooded. The Rev. fathers of St. Ann's church were out all yesterday afternoon giving assistance in deserving cases of distress. Rev. Mr. Patterson has been prosecuting his visits among the poor in the flooded districts, and has been instrumental in relieving many families in Wellington, Queen, Prince, Natureth and Ann streets, and also in St. David, Roy and Dupre lanes. Many sad sights, he says, were to be seen. At this stage our great need is that of fuel to dry the terribly damp houses and household belongings. It is urged that the national societies should take up this matter, as no time is to be lost. The clothing of many of the poor people has been lost and injured to a great extent, and cast-off clothes would in many cases be most acceptable. The Island wharf is almost free of water. About 100 men were busy breaking up ice on the wharves yesterday by order of the Harbor Commissioners, in preparation for the arrival of ocean steamers. There is still a very considerable quantity of ice on the wharves, but it is rapidly disappearing under the influence of the sun and wind. Work in the Grand Trunk shops at Point St. Charles, which has been almost entirely suspended during the floods, will be fully resumed next Monday. A trip along the south shore yesterday presented a sad sight. All the fences along the river bank, between Laprairie and Longueuil have totally disappeared. Many outbuildings have been very seriously injured, and, in some cases, completely demolished. The road has been washed out in several places and altogether the view is a sad one and shows a heavy pecuniary loss. The jamming of the ice and the recent flood has had a telling effect on the lighthouses along the St. Lawrence. At Point Valois the lighthouse was torn away and stranded on Dorval Island. The piers are extensively damaged also. The pier of the new lighthouse just completed at Pointe Claire has been damaged heavily. The one recently constructed at Isle Ste. Therese withstood the shock remarkably well, except the entrance door, which was smashed in. The pier is slightly damaged. The lighthouse at Isle Vache is yet submerged and consequently the damage is not known, but it is thought to be very heavy. The lighthouse at Windsor pier, Ste. Anne, has been carried away, and the pier is seriously damaged. Several other lighthouses have been damaged more or less. BROCKVILLE BOOMING At no former period were so many buildings being put up in Brockville as there are this spring. In every direction houses are going up, mostly all of a good and some of a very superior character. On Main street there is not a single vacant store of any kind. Mr. Bigg is putting up a couple of good stores on the lot opposite the Central hotel. Mr. Comstock is putting up a magnificent building on the lot opposite the new post office on Court House avenue, and some forty dwellings are about being constructed already in various parts of the town. This will be a lively season for the building trades in Brockville. Monitor, The man who never does any harm might crawl into a cave and stay there ten years without being missed.

GOOD FRIDAY, Services at the Various Churches-The Generally Observed Day. The service in the churches of this city yesterday were all well attended and were peculiarly devotional in their nature, as was appropriate to the day. All the Roman Catholic churches were suitably draped in purple, and the voice of devotion was subdued and somewhat sad, soon to rise in a tone of joy and praise on Easter Sunday. The day was everywhere observed as a holy day throughout the city, and not so much as a holiday. In the Protestant churches appropriate services were pretty generally observed and the attendance was large. Below will be found a few particulars concerning the different services held. Tenebræ services were performed in all the Roman Catholic churches during the afternoon. This service consists of the placing of thirteen lighted tapers in the sanctuary which are extinguished one by one, after the singing of """"The Passion."""" The exception is that the thirteenth representing Our Saviour is kept burning, the other tapers being intended to represent the twelve apostles. In all the Roman Catholic churches the special shrines in honor and memory of the Eucharist were visited by large numbers of worshippers. At St. Patrick's church the celebrant of the office was the Rev. Father J. Touplu, assisted by the Rev. Fathers Walsh and Hamel, as deacon and sub-deacon. The Passion was sung by the Rev. Father Hamel.",
18870822,historical,ice,"FLOODS AND THE SOUTH SHORE St Lambert Council Asks the Government to Come to its Aid The following resolutions were adopted unanimously, on Friday evening, by the village council of St Lambert: Whereas, the municipality of the village of St Lambert has suffered serious damage during the past three seasons from inundations, resulting from ice gorges in the River St Lawrence; Whereas, in a report asked for by the Department of Public Works, Ottawa, the mayor of this village explained the damage caused by the ice and flows to property in general, and especially to the principal public roadway along the bank of the said river, which is worn dangerously narrow by the ice, and is liable to be totally destroyed if no protection is afforded; Whereas, certain protective works are being constructed on the north side of the river by the city of Montreal, the completion of which must, of necessity, largely increase the danger of damage and disaster to life and property on the south shore, by forcing the volume of water and ice in that direction; And as it must be admitted that the works required to give adequate protection to the village are of too costly a character to be undertaken by so small a community, on which heavy costs have already been entailed in repairing damages caused by said floods: Resolved, that a memorial be presented to the Federal Government praying them to erect such works as in their wisdom they may deem necessary to prevent or diminish said floods, and to erect a protection wall or ramp along the river bank to preserve said roadway, material for which can be obtained by the removal of Mount's Island and the wharf north of the same; Resolved, that a deputation composed of the Mayor (Mr. Cudlal) and Councillor T. Mallinson be appointed to proceed to Ottawa in company with the delegates from the town of Longueuil and the Federal representative of the county, to confer with the Minister of Public Works in order to secure Government action in this important matter without further delay. ALMOST DECAPITATED Fireman Sparling, of the Salvage Corps, has a Narrow Escape Rescued by a Comrade A telephone alarm to No. 2 station, quickly followed by a second alarm from box 7, brought out the central division of the brigade at 4:20 o'clock on Saturday afternoon for a fire in the Western House, corner of St Paul and McGill streets. The fire had taken from the furnace in the kitchen, and getting in between the lath and plaster and the brick wall, was difficult to get at. After some trouble it was extinguished by two charges from the salvage hose. When the salvage wagon was leaving the station an accident happened by which Fireman Sparling had a narrow escape for his life. As is well known, the harness is suspended from the ceiling by cords and hooks. After the harness was fastened on the horses something went wrong with the weight which pulls the cords back, and the result was that one of the loops caught Mr. Sparling (who was driving) around the neck, drawing him to the back of the wagon. If one of the firemen had not seen the occurrence and swerved the horses round, catching the wheel against the wall, stopping the wagon, nothing could have saved Mr. Sparling's head from being torn off. As it was, a nasty cut has been made round the front portion of his neck and the tendons badly strained. Notwithstanding that he could hardly hold his head up, Mr. Sparling gallantly responded to the call of duty.

On his way home one of the lines slipped out of his hand, and in endeavoring to reach it he lost his balance and fell out, receiving a severe shock. Dr. Wales was at once summoned, and after a careful examination entertained strong hopes of his recovery, but inflammation set in and he died the following Wednesday. The Missisquoi Record, to get a true idea of the crops in the district, issued circulars to representative farmers in Missisquoi and Brume, the replies to which, it says, in the majority of cases speak very encouragingly of the farmers' prospects, and although in some instances the crops will not come up to the expectations of six weeks ago, yet, taken as a whole, the husbandmen of the Townships have no reason to complain. Speaking of the harvest, the Ormstown correspondent of the Huntingdon Gleaner says: Harvesting may be said to be over, there being only occasional fields here and there uncut. Many farmers report the presence in their peas of a pest which this section has been free of hitherto, though it has been doing great damage in Ontario for years—the worm; the extent of the damage will be known on threshing them, which has begun. Grain is light in most places. The Waterloo Advertiser says: The Richmond Guardian points out that the Hon.

MONITOBA'S HARVEST—A Magnificent Wheat Crop Now Being Gathered The wheat harvest began in dead earnest yesterday all over the province, and for the next two weeks or so there will be little rest for the farmers. The barley and oat crops by this time are nearly all harvested; and here and there over the province, particularly near Virden, Brandon, Morden and Gretna, wheat cutting has been going on more or less extensively for the past two weeks, and a good portion has been harvested. But speaking of the province as a whole, wheat cutting has only just commenced, but it is now underway in every section of the country and every fine day will see tens of thousands of bushels harvested. On the whole wheat has been from eight to ten days later in maturing this year than last, as by the 20th of August last year most of the grain was down. It will also take a good deal longer to gather in the harvest this year than in previous seasons. The acreage is considerably larger than ever before, and the yield is quite as heavy as anticipated, frequently running up to thirty-five bushels to the acre. Harvest help is also scarce, and in Southern Manitoba $45 per month, with board, is being offered for farm laborers. There also threatens to be a dearth of binding twine, owing to the vast quantities that will be needed. The Dakota farmers are even worse off. An implement dealer in the city went to the trouble the other day of getting quotations of binding twine at leading points throughout the Northwestern States. In St. Paul the price is 15c for sisal in carload lots, with the freight charges to add; at Fargo it is 18c to 20c for manila; at Barnesville there is no twine to be had at any price; at Crookston 18c to 20c for manila. The price in Manitoba is 15c at all points for manila. Winnipeg Free Press, August 17. """"It Meant to us"""" A sympathetic Kind Old Lady """"And so you are blind my poor man?""""

18860610,historical,ice,"THE CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS The Chairman said: From the Harbor Master's report it will be seen that the tonnage for the month of May is the largest which we have ever had. The ocean vessels seem to be getting larger every year, the number for 1883 having been 74, average tonnage 1,171, with the same number this year they average 1,310 or 180 tons more than four years ago, so that for the same number of vessels, the tonnage has increased nearly 15,000 tons. It is worthy of notice that, notwithstanding the height of the floods reached this year, the water by 31st May had fallen to 20, that being the lowest for the previous three years, the difference being respectively 14, 8 and 12 inches less than the three previous years. The statement of revenue shows an increase of fully 14 percent for the month, as will be seen by the revenue statement. From the Engineer's report I note the following remarks: The ice left the Richelieu at Sorel, on the 12th April, without damage to the vessels wintered there. The main body of ice on the St. Lawrence between Montreal and Sorel moved off on the 18th April, and on the 24th the harbor dredging fleet came up from their winter quarters to Montreal. On the 20th the setting of the buoys was commenced with two boats, one working upwards and the other downwards from Sorel, and on the 30th April those which are essential to the opening of navigation were all placed. On the 27th the first dredges of the ship channel fleet left Sorel, and by the 6th May all were at work on their stations. MONTREAL HARBOR On the clearing away of the ice from the harbor it was found that, although no very great destruction had occurred at any one place, there had been a number of minor damages, which in the aggregate are rather larger than the average. No such quantity of ice was left lodged on the wharves as in the spring of 1885, but from section 21 (opposite Canadian Pacific Railway station) downwards, there was much more than usual, and it was necessary, in order to make vessels' berths, that a great deal should be removed by hand. The expenditure for this amounts to about $1,900. Dredging commenced on the 3rd May. Section 16 The pier used at the St Helen's island ferry wharf had the plank top stripped off and was otherwise considerably damaged during winter. The downstream side, which was the worst, is being built, and a new top is being put on throughout. The roadways and wharves received minor damages during winter in many places. These have been, in a great measure, repaired during the month, and, with the exception of the crib work in sections 9 and 10, Windmill Point, the whole is now in a fair condition for use. It may be noted, as a matter of record, that two grain carriers have been built at high level across the wharf at sections 21 and 22 for carrying grain from the new Canadian Pacific Railway elevator to the mill in the lumber, and they seem to be working well. An important judgment was rendered in our favor on the 28th May, regarding the responsibility of the commissioner in the event of damage to vessels by the work of the steamboat Ottawa. The Chief Justice stated that he was unable to find any law for holding the commissioner responsible for the accident, that they were not private corporations, but a public corporation created to perform certain work under the supervision of the Government, and with authority in placing buoys in such places as they might consider necessary. The following letter has been received from the Department of Public Works: Ottawa, June 7, 1888, Sir, I am directed to state for the information of the Harbour Commissioner of Montreal that, in compliance with the request made, an order thereon has been issued appointing Henry K. Perley, representing the Board of Trade and Corn Exchange Association of Montreal, John K. Sherwood, representing the Board of Marine Commissioners of Montreal, and Percival W. K., Secretary of the Commission, It is satisfactory to know that the Commission has at last been appointed, and that they will be sent today to meet. It is hoped that they may be able to arrive at an early decision, so that all possible work may be done this season. AS EXPLANATION During the last few weeks I have noticed several letters in the papers commenting on an interview with me made by a gentleman of the press. These I did not think it necessary to notice, as they seemed to be too absurd to be believed, but in justice to the gentleman let me say that I am credited with saying that Mr. Thomas Workman had in the thirties written his name under the eaves of the building where Joe's canteen now stands, from a river boat. If instead of from a river boat you will read from the ice it will be correct, Mr. Workman being my authority, and I believe the year was 1839. My object in mentioning this was to show that when there was no revetment wall the shelving bank allowed the ice to be pushed up to a much higher height than has been the case since the revetment wall was built. As for Mr. Hogan having built from the foot of Nelson a monument, I never spoke to Mr. O'Hara on the subject, know nothing about it, and do not believe it. REPORT OF MARITIME Number and tonnage of sea-going vessels that arrived in port from the opening of navigation up to June 1st the following years: Years 1883 1884 1885 1886 1887 Parent, Mayor Hurtubise, of Longueuil, L. L. Morin, Mr. Lalonde, and Mr. Vauasse, M.P. for Yamaska. Windmill Point was visited, and the proposed extension of wharves upwards was explained and the ground pointed out. The tug steamed down the river to near Longue Pointe, and returned to Montreal. On the way down the Harbor engineer showed plans of the proposed lumber wharves at Hochelaga, and also plans of notable ice thaws, etc., for several years past. HOUSEHOLD SUPPLIES Where a Good Selection Can be Secured This is the season when a visit to Bonsecours market can be made with most satisfactory results, for the quality, quantity and variety of household supplies offered cannot be equaled elsewhere. This week the offerings have been liberal, even profuse, which ensures to the buyer ample scope to make selections, and at prices too which are low enough to suit nearly every purse. A special feature of this week is the display of early fruits, including excellent apricots from California, and peaches and cherries from the same quarter. Strawberries have become more plentiful and consequently more reasonable in price. The dairy produce department is worthy of patronage as several of the dealers make it a point to keep the very best stock on hand. There was a good line of fresh killed poultry, and frozen turkeys, geese, chickens, etc., are always kept by the principal dealers who have large refrigerators for that purpose. Beef, mutton, lamb and smoked meats of fine quality are to be had at moderate prices, with no change made for delivery, which is always made promptly. Fish from salmon to herring can be purchased on satisfactory terms. Altogether Bonsecours market is well worthy of the extensive patronage it receives.",
18860419,historical,ice or flood?,"ST. PAUL STREET, between McGill and St. Francois Xavier Street, where the level is very low, was soon covered, it flowing into the cellars of the stores alone, filling them, coming as high as the window sills in some cases. Carts and express wagons were brought into requisition, and such goods as were exposed to danger and had not already been ruined were removed, some to higher ground and others to the upper storeys. On H'ALL STREET the water came up past St. Ann's market, which was surrounded, though the floor was not reached, and no damage was done in the battle of the building. The cellars, as well as those along Foundling and Grey Nun streets, were filled. So also were those in the blocks to the south. The Custom House stood like an islet and the clerks had to make their way out in carts and cabs. The Allan steamship office and the Harbor Commissioners' building were in the same fix. About 2 o'clock or a little later a slight fall took place and the water retired somewhat, but it was for a short time only. By 3 o'clock it was higher in the streets than ever. McGill was covered as far as the Albion hotel, and the water had risen and covered the sections of Wellington, William and intersecting streets. At 10 o'clock the state of things was worse at night than on the city side of the canal. In Congregation, Wellington, Hacdalen, Consol, Forfar, Grand Trunk, Richardson, Patrick and other streets the water rose to a height of two or three feet, according to the level. The sidewalks floated round and were used by the inhabitants as rafts to keep up communication with each other. At the Point police station there was five feet of water in the cellar, and the policemen had removed their coal to one of the cells for safe keeping. The fire station on Centre Street was cut off by several feet of water. There were of course many incidents, some of them laughable, some of them sad, connected with the flood. Men and boys constructed rafts and paddled round on them; express wagons were in use as ferries and conveyed loads of waiting people, men and women, to their homes, not a few of which were partly under water. Large crowds of people collected in the affected districts and stood in groups watching the water as it slowly crept up, bearing with it blocks of ice, which stranded on the street as it would ebb for a short time, only to return with greater volume within a comparatively short period. The chief cause of the flood was doubtless the breaking-up of the ice in the reaches above the Lachine Rapids. At Beauharnois on Friday night the lake ice began to move. From Vaudreuil on Saturday morning came the news that the ice was passing down taking with it wharves and buildings close to the shore. The mass, with the accompanying flood, piling up on an already jammed front of the city, continually aggravated the trouble, till the flood in Montreal exceeded anything in the memory of the oldest inhabitant, surpassing, it is estimated, by several feet that of the year 1861. The Lachine Rapids have obliterated, so high has the river risen. The country for miles on the south side of the river was covered. From the mountain top, far as the eye could reach, nothing could be seen on the south but a vast expanse of water spreading over the country. Prairie village must have suffered terribly though no detailed advices have been received as to the exact character of the damage done. It is said that over the low land between that village and St. Johns the whole country is covered. The water flows over the district south of the canal, the banks of which have heretofore formed a sort of safeguard to the section north of it. But this year, so high is the flood, that the water in the neighborhood of the sugar refinery flows over the walls into the canal itself, and then over the upper bank into William Street, down which it pours. In the city itself the water extends to districts never before affected. Craig Street and St. Antoine Street from St. Henri Street to St. Urbain Street is covered. Victoria Square is a lake. The low part of Vitre Street in rear of the drill shed is flooded, and the cellars of the houses in the neighborhood filled. Chenneville and St. George Streets are in the same position where they run into Craig Street. It is impossible at the present time to form any estimate of the damage that has been done on the flooded streets. It would be easier to say who had not than who had suffered. Coming higher than was anticipated, higher than was ever before known, the water reached many houses and business places that made no preparation for such an event, and it was in these that the greatest damage occurred. THE SCENES ON SUNDAY. About 1 o'clock on Sunday morning a sudden rise took place, filling many cellars that had hitherto escaped, as far from the river Craig Street, among these those of the Gazette and St. Lawrence Hall. At 11 o'clock another rise took place, and by 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon had flooded the low-lying parts of the central district of the city. The Central fire station, on Craig Street, was surrounded by water, and the firemen had to go in and out for a boat. The water extended along to Victoria Square and up to Jurors Street, and even those driving in cabs did not escape without wet feet, for the carriages were nearly up in the shafts. On Honavenltir Street, a little west of Victoria Square, the water suddenly made its appearance and spread along as far as the eye could reach. The street was also submerged from HUGH beyond the American building to some distance past Craig Street. St. Antoine Street was in a similar condition, which was flooded up to St. Maurice Street and the gallery of the Albion Hall was crowded all day by visitors, waiting on the busy street. There were three feet of water on the ground floor of the main building. The water was literally covered with rafts, boats and debris of all descriptions, and the streets were in constant communication with the main roads and accidents were numerous. One man, having broken up a raft and cast its remnants into the water, was laughing at the predicament he found himself in when he drove into the water, giving a sudden lurch that sent him into the water too. Accidents were numerous in the flooded streets and furnished a source of innocent merriment to onlookers. The district between Wellington and St. Peter Streets, which lies lower than the eastern part of the business section, suffered more, and in some places the water rose to St. Sacrament Street where two merchants were driving brisk trade, conveying merchants and their employees to and from the different stores at exorbitant prices. Quite a number of men were seen with rubber boots up to their thighs trudging through the water, rather than pay fifty cents for a seat of 200 or 300 feet. But in St. Paul Street and the adjacent districts the water was far too deep for pedestrianism. Numbers of men could be seen hanging around unable to reach their homes which they had left on Saturday morning to go to work, and some of those poor fellows had scarcely anything to eat in the interval. Their plight was pitiable in the extreme. Joe Leof's being flooded out, most of his customers could be seen sitting on the doorstep looking disconsolately at the waste of waters, flowing eastwards towards Jarry Park where the bank rises. The water did not extend so far, and people were able to go down as far as Commissioners Street. The ice was not broken up nearly so much as jammed, and presented the appearance of a solid sheet, slightly roughened on top, the only evidences of shifts having taken place being the encumbrance of ice along the revetment wall and the cronkedness of the river roads. Some of these started out in a straight line, and continued so for a few hundred yards, when they suddenly stopped, and to find the continuation one had to look a quarter of a mile down stream. The dump seems to have grounded on the long wharf, and there it will probably stay. The whole population of the town seemed to have gathered in the central district to watch the progress of the flood, and many were speculating on the chances of a lengthened period of enforced idleness. All afternoon the water continued to rise, and by six o'clock Craig Street was impassable west from St. Urbain Street. The basements of the houses had long been flooded, but now the water rose over the side streets and the district between St. Denis and St. Lawrence Main was soon covered. Between Craig and Vitre, St. Constant and German Streets were perhaps the worst, and from the houses planks had been laid to the floating sidewalks. St. Elizabeth and Sanguinet were also partially covered, and Vitre Street in places resembled a chain of miniature lakes. St. Charles Borromeo, St. Urbain and Cote Streets were also submerged, and boats and rafts were plying here and there. The Central Fire Station on Craig Street was also invaded, and in a few moments the men's bedroom was under water and everything soaking. EXTENT OF THE AFFECTED DISTRICT. At 11 o'clock the water extended up St. Urbain Street, about fifty yards above Craig Street and from Craig up Alexander Street to Vitre, remaining the same; on Cote Street it was up to the Theatre Royal, and rose as high as the hubs of carriage wheels on Vitre, between St. George and Chenneville. On the upper side of Vitre Street a building, the foundations of which were completed, was filled to the level of the sidewalk. The water extended several yards above Vitre on St. George. In order to reach the western end of the lower portion of the city a detour had to be made by way of Palace Street to Cathedral, as the water covered St. Antoine to past Ste. Montpie, and fully flooded St. David's Lane. Driving along St. Antoine the stretch of water covering St. James West and the railway was clearly visible on passing every side street, and it was not till Fillfold Street was reached that a passage to Notre Dame Street West could be effected. On St. James Street West the flood almost reached the corner of Fulford, several yards of which latter street were under water, which flowed into many basements to the depth of four feet, covering the stoves and quenching the household fires. A room was impassable to foot passengers, and sundry express wagons, owned by enterprising drivers, ferried people across at the moderate sum of five cents per head. From halfway between Craig and Vitre, on Bleury Street, wagons were employed in transporting passengers to the higher ground on St. Peter, while a number of people were floating on improvised rafts, made from portions of sidewalks, on all the streets east from Victoria Square to Cote. At the corner of the latter and Craig incidents were numerous, some of which resulted in many people getting wet. Several photographers were observed taking views of the flooded streets. At night numerous boats flitted along St. Antoine, Bonaventure, McGill and other streets. AT POINT ST. CHARLES the suffering must be most severe. The water has risen to a height fully two feet higher than during the inundation last May. The wind is strong. At the Grand Trunk office the water came up to the desk at the innermost end. The works are, of course, stopped, only by last accounts communication is kept up. Several horses are known to have been drowned, and no doubt not a few cows have met like fate. The people are in a sad plight. Not only are they without means of communication, but many are without food or the means of obtaining it, for but few of the retailers in the affected districts are able to run. Even if it were still the waters recede, it would be impractical to reach it. At the station no trains arrived yesterday. The cars in the yard stand in the water. At Our Street an engine was caught by the rising flood, submerged and its course stopped. """"Bill AMATS!"""" Boatmen who have established their businesses at several points are evidently determined to make all they can of their particular situation, and exorbitant prices from whoever seeks to use their means of transportation. As much as ten dollars was demanded for the transport of a boat for half an hour, from someone who had to make a journey from necessity or chose to do it from curiosity. They did fair amount of business, too. The river is thought to be in the St. Mary's current. Advices from the shelters up to 1 o'clock say there has been but an imperceptible rise in the level of the river, while above it along the city front the rise must have been eight or ten feet since Saturday. ON THE SOUTH SHORE, a representative of the Gazette on Friday night commenced to the south shore to inquire as to the damage there, but owing to the high water interfering with communication he has been unable either to correspond with the office or return with his report. All trains have been shipped and washouts have occurred in several places. An unbroken is reported on the track at St. Louis, which village, or the greater part of it, is covered with water. The suburbs have suffered severely. The Gazette's press, engine and electric light rooms are five feet deep. The basement is affected in a minor degree. The Withee establishment on Bonaventure Street is surrounded by water and the cellar as well as those of other buildings in that vicinity flooded. The police station on St. Nicholas Street is in a like fix. All will, it is understood, be more or less dependent on their more fortunate rivals for assistance in making their regular appearance today. Proceeding to the riverbanks, a rumor was sent the rounds last night that an attempt would be made to start the jam which it was said existed at Longue Pointe. The name of Aid. Stevenson, chairman of the inundation committee, was mentioned as having the thing in hand and learning that the City Hall was to be made the starting point, a Gazette reporter went there. Joe Vincent, the well-known boatman, was on hand and was ready to place himself at the disposal of Aid. Stevenson. That gentleman arrived in the Central Station, accompanied by Captain Beckingham, of the salvage corps, who, acting on instructions, had roused the colonel from his sleep and brought him down. The theory was that the deep navigation cutting was the cause of the jam, and that it was loaded about Thibaudeau at Longue Pointe. Col. Stevenson proceeded to investigate, and as a result came to the conclusion that any attempt, such as suggested, would be fruitless. In the first place, Vincent gave it as his opinion that the placing of dynamite would be a most dangerous work, and that after it was placed it was ten to one that it would not do any good. The scheme was dropped as of no use, and the chairman of the inundation committee got home again. NOW THE RIVER. Saturday night's advices from down river ports were that at Three Rivers the lake ice was on the move since 2 p.m. Lachine reported a slight shove accompanied by a rise, and then a fall in the water. At Berthierville the ice was rotten and it was hoped the river would be clear by today. Looking down the river from Montreal at dusk no sign of a break-up was apparent; as far as the eye could reach was one stretch of rugged ice pack, unbroken except in one or two very small patches. Over towards St. Lambert the same view presented itself, the only extent of water visible being where Commissioners Street was five feet under water. Here the current swept along at the rate of four or five miles an hour. Many of the stevedores' offices, placed on the street for safety during the winter, have been upset and are liable to be crushed or carried off when the final rush takes place. The office and sheds of the R.K.O. Navigation Company at the foot of McGill Street have been demolished. AT LOCHUMDA. At Lochumda yesterday afternoon there had been no change for the past twenty-four hours, showing clearly that the jam existed above them. The channel was one mass of solid ice, the lake ice having come down and wedged itself between the surface ice and the bottom. Behind the rubber works a heavy mass of ice had grounded on the piers, leaving an open space of three or four acres below. The Canadian Pacific Railway track was unharmed, being at the lowest point four feet above water. However, every precaution was taken and men were set to watch the track and bridges. As a matter of precaution only the inside track was used. There was absolutely no change in the ice from 2 till 10 o'clock. RELIEFS OR RELIEF. Colonel Stevenson, chairman of the inundation committee, last evening gave orders to Fraser, Viger & Co. for packages of tea, coffee and other provisions to be distributed among the sufferers. The firm were consequently at work all night, and this morning will have a large supply ready for immediate distribution. Captain Beckingham also received orders from him to load up the spare salvage wagon with bread from Mr. Strachan's bakery and drive it down to McGill Street where it will be taken in boats and distributed about the poor people. The work of relief will be begun at 8:30 this morning. The presidents of the national societies held an informal meeting last night to discuss what means it would be advisable to take to distribute relief. In Point St. Charles the water was reported to be from 18 to 24 inches higher than during the late flood. The police have a boat mounted on a truck to be driven to fires. The Royal Electric Lighting Company's factory was flooded last night, and the water having entered the gas pipes the submerged district was almost in total darkness. Many of the principal buildings were lighted by lamps or candles. Dr. Thayer called on the Mayor last night and informed him that the water had backed up until it was flush with the head of the Lachine Rapids, and that there was great danger of its bursting over the banks and sweeping down over the flats. He urged His Worship to have the jam at Longueuil blown up with dynamite. The Mayor, who was very sick, gave his authorization to anything that could be done, and referred Dr. Thayer to Aid. Stevenson, who, however, found that the project was not feasible. At 2 o'clock this morning Aid. Stevenson was making a raid on the St. Lawrence Hall for provisions for the men working at the pumps. Early yesterday morning, while the employees of Messrs. Robertson & Co. were removing goods out of reach of the water, a case on which one of the men was standing upset, throwing him into the water. The case fell on the top of him and he would in all probability have been drowned had not his fellow man come to his help. A peculiar scene was witnessed by Constable Magill and Sergeant Khoe yesterday afternoon. While walking down William Street they looked through a window and saw a table floating around the dining-room. The table was covered by a cloth, and on it was a meal, a lighted oil lamp, the remains of a breakfast, a cat and two rats. The rats were quietly eating the fragments and keeping close together, fearing an attack from the cat, while the latter was apparently wise enough to know that in the event of a struggle the lamp would be upset. The express drivers at Victoria Square relieved one of the drivers to the Derby by their exclamations of """"Right here, gentlemen; take your chance across the river for five cents,"""" and other like remarks urging to start across at once. """"Come along, gents; five cents per head."""" The police patrolled along St. Paul Street all yesterday forenoon, and turned out the street lamps. In some places they also did service in ferrying people across the street.""",
18840107,historical,ice,"P. Bowes, contractor, broke through the ice opposite the Montreal Rolling Mills on Saturday and was lost. Patrick Hanley, 150 Young Street, was struck by a piece of ice falling from a roof on Notre Dame Street on Saturday morning and received a severe cut on the head. Mr. Thomas Robertson, M.L. Light, Chief Engineer of Railways of the Province of Quebec, in a letter to the Chronicle, favors the construction of a bridge to span the St. Lawrence near Quebec. He says recent surveys with modern inventions having proved that the River St. Lawrence could be bridged near Quebec at a reasonable cost, without detriment to navigation, I would suggest that the time has arrived for the construction of such a bridge, and that the Federal Government, on behalf of the Intercolonial, should unite with the Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific Railways to effect this object by means of which the traffic of the Grand Trunk and Intercolonial Railways should be enabled to enter the city of Quebec, and a winter outlet be afforded to the Canadian Pacific over the Intercolonial Railway. Regarding the cost of the bridge, I have no doubt that for such an object the money could be borrowed at 4 percent, with a Government guarantee, as in a presently similar case at St. John, N.B. Several offices in the Departmental Buildings are being converted into committee rooms in anticipation of the meeting of the Legislature. Mr. Francis Eden has been appointed Vice-Consul for Sweden and Norway. There is a report current that Almi will give two concerts in Quebec next summer. Two French frigates from the Newfoundland station will visit the St. Lawrence next year. The first mails from the country parishes since the great storm which set in on the 1st instant reached town today, the bags having to be carried in on snowshoes. Such a complete stoppage of communication in the country has not been known here for twenty years. The markets today were consequently but very slightly attended. The cold here is not so intense as reported West, and the thermometer has not yet, up to tonight, reached zero. Madame Verier, boarding house keeper, Garneau Street, dropped dead last night at her residence from apoplexy. Quebec, January 6. The weather was excessively cold today and for a time, there was an ice jam right across the river, the boats having great difficulty in keeping the bridge from forming. THE WEATHER Toronto, January 7. The area of highest pressure extends from Manitoba southeast to the middle Atlantic coast, and there is a disturbance covering Texas and the adjacent states. Throughout the continent the weather has been unusually cold, the temperature falling to 20 degrees as far south as the State of Mississippi. The lowest temperatures reported in Canada have been 20 below zero at Parry Sound, 33 below at Corkliffe and 21 below at Quebec. The excessive cold which has prevailed for some days in the Northwest Territories is beginning to moderate. Forecast: Winds gradually shifting towards the eastward; generally fair weather today; snow areas tomorrow; not much change in temperature. St. Lawrence: Moderate to fresh winds; fair, continued very cold weather. Maritime: Moderate to fresh west to northwest winds; fair, continued very cold weather. At Chicago the thermometer at 7 AM on Saturday was 27 below zero. Batavia is still partially paralyzed. There were a number of fires last night, and the endurance of the firemen was taxed to the utmost. The Interviage flats caught fire, and a number of people were compelled to seek the street in their night clothes. The severe weather caused a great many needy people and tramps to besiege the relief agencies. At St. Louis the thermometer registered 22 below zero; the lowest since 1640. At Kansas City it was 29 below, and many miles were frozen to death on the Pacific train. At Louisville, Kentucky, it was 18 below, and several deaths are reported from freezing, and much suffering occurred among the cattle. At Fort Wayne, Indiana, it was 24 below, at Elkhart 23 below, and at New Albany 21 below, the coldest known in thirty-five years. In the South the heaviest snowstorm in years prevailed over almost the whole of Virginia, extending to South Carolina. NORTHWEST WHEAT QUESTION: A letter from General Van Horn on the subject to the Winnipeg Free Press. We find the following important letter from General Manager Van Home in the Winnipeg Free Press of the 31st December, 1883: To the Editor of the Free Press; So I have watched with deep interest the discussion of the wheat and elevator situation in the newspapers of Manitoba, and as it had taken such shape as to injure the country abroad, and as much that has been said reflects upon the policy of this company, I beg permission to say something on the subject, but first I wish to remark that the discussion, as it has been carried on, would impress one not conversant with the facts with the belief that the entire wheat crop of Manitoba, instead of a small percentage of it, had been ruined by frost. The general question of rates is too wide to admit of clear discussion within the limits of a communication of this kind, but a comparison of the prices paid for wheat at our stations with those paid in Minnesota and Dakota will prove conclusively that our farmers are as well off, and generally better off, in this respect, than their neighbors to the South. It is not the rate between two local stations that should be considered, but the through rate that the company is able to offer and on which the local grain markets are based. Just now the chief cause of complaint seems to be the prices offered for damaged wheat, of which there is a large quantity in some localities. The Canadian Pacific Company will gladly do anything within its power to enable the farmers to dispose of this wheat at good prices; but as it does not answer the purposes of the Manitoba millers, one of two things must be done with it. It must either be held for spring shipment via Port Arthur, or it must be shipped through by rail to eastern points. The all-rail rates will leave scarcely anything for the farmers. We have used our best endeavors with the eastern lines to secure a reduction in rates, but without avail. We have reduced our own rates on the damaged wheat one-third, but were we to have it free over our own line it would not afford appreciable relief. The damaged wheat is very uneven in quality, and among the millers everywhere there is a wide difference of opinion as to its value. The shippers cannot know what prices it will bring on reaching the eastern market, and for safety they are obliged to allow large margins. It appears, therefore, that the all-rail shipment of this wheat must result in sacrifice either to the farmer or the shipper. On the other hand, there is good reason to believe that the damaged wheat, if stored in large quantities until the opening of navigation, would heat, and buyers are not disposed to take this risk. They would require very large margins to justify them in doing so, and they cannot reasonably be blamed for exacting them. Nor are the Manitoba millers to blame for not buying this wheat. They have a special market for their shipping flour, and have endeavored to secure for it the highest standing in the eastern and foreign markets, already with considerable success, but they must have the very best wheat from which to make it, and it is certainly to the interest of every farmer in the Northwest that the reputation of Manitoba flour, as well as of Manitoba wheat, should be put above all the rest of the world and kept there, as it can and should be. I know that it will pinch many farmers who have much damaged wheat to hold it until the opening of navigation, but I believe that if they can and will do it, and will in the meantime guard against its further injury by keeping it dry and giving it light and air, they will have little cause to complain. As to the so-called elevator monopoly, I beg to say that none exists on our lines. Every person who likes may build an elevator on our grounds without charge for ground rent, and on as liberal terms as are given to anyone, and no individual or corporation will have any advantage over him in rates. Our requirements in the way of elevators are not severe. The stations are graded for buildings of 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 bushels minimum bin capacity, according to the prospective business. If any company or individual should build an elevator at a cost of $10,000 at any station it will not prevent the building by any other party of one costing less than half that amount, if it comes up to the required capacity for that station and is provided with the usual appliances for handling and cleaning grain. In this matter we have followed the practice of almost every railway company in the grain-producing States, a practice which long experience has shown to produce the best results for all concerned and to be absolutely necessary where grain is largely produced. Some railways provide elevators of their own, and require all grain to be handled through them, but this plan has never worked satisfactorily, as it has a tendency to breed a crop of irresponsible buyers. A grain buyer in an ordinary warehouse, buying two or three kinds of grain and several grades of each kind, has little chance to grade it properly, and when it is coming in freely he cannot grade it at all. Wheat is then wheat, and must all go in the same pile, good and bad, """"goose wheat"""" and """"hard rye."""" Such a mixture does not bring the average value of the different lots, but only a little more than the value of the lowest grade, and the buyer can only pay for the best about the value of the worst. The buyer is unable to clean his grain, and he must ship it, dirt and all, and must leave a margin for that. Again, a flat warehouse costs but a few hundred dollars; and where they are permitted they multiply until the station ground is covered, and until there are more buyers than the market will supply at a reasonable profit. If they compete, they are driven to cheating in weights or grades. If they do not compete, they divide their purchases and take a sufficient margin to afford a living for all. The usual margin among a lot of warehouses is from 10 cents a bushel upwards, unless they are able to make the nominal margin less by taking the difference out of grades or weights. At the elevator the margin is usually between three and four cents. This is according to my experience on grain roads, which has covered a period of more than twenty years. It is true that the elevator men sometimes take wider margins, and sometimes cheat, but they are more easily watched and controlled, and they have too much at stake to justify the risk. A threat on the part of the railway company to withdraw their protection has never failed, so far as I know, to have the desired effect, and to straighten out anything crooked. The elevators are provided with separate bins for the different kinds and grades of grain and with cleaning apparatus, and are able to handle grain more cheaply, and to get more value out of it, than can be done by means of any warehouse, and I feel sure that every farmer who has had experience with both systems will agree with me that, notwithstanding the original abuse of their system by the elevator men, the elevator benefits the producer as well as the consumer. The only way to secure the elevators is by providing the necessary facilities. An elevator exists, if he will build it, and an elevator in connection with the railway is the best way to sell his grain to advantage. Our elevator contract requires us to receive, store and load grain at reasonable rates, and the principal rates for handling are two cents per bushel, as low as anywhere in the western States. In conclusion permit me to say that this company has as great an interest as the farmers themselves in the payment of the highest possible prices for grain and other produce and that it is making every effort at Port Arthur and elsewhere to provide the cheapest possible outlet for the products of the Northwest, and no expense will be spared to that end; but the value of Manitoba wheat will depend largely upon its general reputation abroad, and this is within the control of the farmers. They must plough early and not wait until the verge of winter. They must sow good seed and of the kind most wanted, and they must sow it early; and when they have secured a crop, they must stack it carefully and keep ice and snow out of it. Fine particles of ice and snow in wheat marketed in winter cannot be detected, and one lot containing them may ruin ten times the quantity in an elevator bin. This increases the risk of the buyers and is certain to widen their margins, the careful farmer suffering with the careless. Neglect in those particulars has contributed largely to the present causes of complaint. Respectfully yours, W.",

The water rose again today and the bridges are still in serious danger. V. OUT OF THE SEASON, A Serious flood report from various points Jkt Damage Home, Hamilton, Ont, April 1; The gale here today did much damage along the bay and Burlington beach. There is a washout on the Northern and Northwestern between this city and the beach. Several docks have been carried away and vessels damaged and part of Walton's ice house was blown down. CARTWINSUR, Ont, April 6 A heavy gale struck this village about noon and carried away the south end of the building formerly known as the Royal Exchange hotel, owned by James Flake, of Toronto, and smashed in the front window of a tailor shop. Toronto, April 6 A heavy gale has been blowing here since early this morning, accompanied by snow. It is feared that considerable damage has been done to the island and breakwater. About nine o'clock the scaffolding was blown from Manning's arcade, King Street, and struck John Green, coal carter, who was driving past at the time, on the head, knocking him off in front of the wheels. The cart passed over his right leg and abdomen, breaking his leg and inflicting internal injuries that may prove fatal.

18850217,historical,ice,"HUDSON'S BAY NAVIGATION, Report of the Commander of the Expedition of Last Year, THE ICE BARRIERS ENCOUNTERED, GTTiwi, February 10, The report of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, presented this afternoon, contains a most interesting and important report by Lieut. Gordon, who commanded the expedition to Hudson's Bay last summer. The Neptune, the vessel chartered for the expedition, left Halifax on July 7, 1911, and arrived at Churchill Island, Hudson's Bay, on September 9th, and at York Factory on the 11th of the same month, having established along the way a number of observatory stations. The main interest in the report centers in the condition and character of the navigation of Hudson's Straits and Bay, on which point Lieut. Gordon says: The ice has been supposed, hitherto, to be the most formidable barrier to the navigation of the straits, but its nature disappears, to a great extent, under investigation. The ice met with on the cruise of the Neptune may be divided into three classes having distinctly separate origins. They are: icebergs from the glaciers of Fox Channel; heavy Arctic field ice from the channel itself, and what may be called ordinary field ice, being that which had been formed on the shores of the bay and straits. We met no icebergs in Hudson's Bay, nor did I hear of any being seen there. In the straits a good many were seen, principally along the north shore, where many of them were stranded in the coves, and some were met with in mid-channel. Of those seen in the eastern end of the straits, some had undoubtedly come in from Davis' Straits, passing between Resolution Island and East Bluff; but all of those met to the westward had come from Fox Channel, as observations made by Mr. Ashe, at North Bluff, show that an iceberg coming in sight from the westward will pass out of view to the eastward in from three to four tides, showing an easterly set of upwards of ten miles a day. The ICEBERGS SEEN IN HUDSON'S STRAITS in August and September would form no greater barriers to navigation than do those met with off the Straits of Belle Isle, nor were they more numerous in Hudson's Straits than they frequently are off Belle Isle. The ordinary field ice was met with off North Bluff and the Upper Savages, on the 11th of August. This ice, though it would have compelled an ordinary iron steamer to go dead slow, gave no trouble to the Neptune, the mate on watch running the steamer at full speed through between the pans, rarely touching one of them. Just before entering Ashe's Inlet we had to break through a heavy string, which was, however, done without in the slightest degree injuring the ship. In the harbor (Ashe Inlet) the ice came in with the flood tide, and set so fast that the Eskimo were able to walk off to the ship, a distance of three-quarters of a mile. On the south shore our experience was much the same, but no ice was met with through which the ship could not have forced her way without damage. In the center of the straits, to the east of North Bluff, no field ice was seen at all, and after leaving Stuart's Bay, on the outward voyage, although the vessel lay-to for the night in the ice, it was only to wait for daylight, and not because the ice was too heavy. This pack extended about eighteen miles out into the straits, and after getting over this distance we came into clear water. From this point to Charles Island, and thence to the end of Salisbury Island, icebergs were frequently seen, but as their direction was invariably parallel to our course, or nearly so, we coasted round them. On the homeward voyage none of this field ice was seen. The Eskimo, both at Ashe Inlet and Stuart's Bay, informed me that there was an unusually great quantity of ice in the straits this year, and that they had never seen the ice hang to the shores so late in the season. THE HEAVY ARCTIC ICE, After passing the east end of Salisbury Island the ice got heavier and closer, and when off Nottingham Island the pack was so run together that I determined to give up the attempt to force the ship through it, and working out again, headed more to the southward. In making in for the land here we broke the propeller, but succeeded in taking the ship into harbor with the stumps. Viewed from the top of a hill on Nottingham Island the sea in every direction was one vast ice field, and to the southward, between Southeast Point and Cape Oigges, we saw four vessels fast. The ice was altogether of a different type to what we had hitherto met with. Some of it was over 40 feet thick of solid blue ice, not field ice, which had been thickened by piling of pan on pan, but a solid sheet of ice which had evidently been frozen just as we saw it. Much of it was 20 feet thick, and for the general average of all the field we passed through coming into harbor I estimate that the thickness would have been upwards of 15 feet. The question as to the origin of this ice and whether it will be frequently met with in the west end of the Straits is an important one; for in such ice, when closely packed, a vessel even of the build and power of the Neptune was perfectly helpless. I do not consider that it is possible for ice to form in Fox Channel to a greater thickness than 10 feet in a single year, and I feel convinced that much of the ice which we encountered was the accumulation of several years. The depth to which water will freeze has, so far as I know, never yet been determined, but it is certain that ice being a very poor conductor of heat, once a certain thickness of ice has been formed, the rate of thickening will be very slow. In regard to this point, measurements of the formation of ice will be made at some of the observing stations in Hudson's Straits this year, which will assist in finally determining this question. If, as seems probable from the reports of the Hudson's Bay ships, this year and last year have been exceptionally heavy ice years, it is reasonable to conclude that only occasionally does this heavy Fox Channel ice appear in Hudson's Straits. Another piece of confirmatory evidence as to the EXCEPTIONAL NATURE of THE ICE met with in the northern part of the bay this year is the statement in Captain Fisher's letter, found at Marble Island and quoted in the narrative portion of my report, that he had been unable to reach, up to the date of his letter, the east shore, or to go up the Welcome on account of the ice. The harbor ice forms at Churchill on the average about the middle of November and breaks up about the middle of June. As this is the only known harbor on the west coast of the bay, these times may be taken as marking the extreme limits of the season during which it would be possible for a ship to enter and leave the harbor. It is only fair to state that had I been making the passage from Cape Chudleigh, direct to Churchill instead of coasting and working across the Straits, I do not consider that I should have been delayed by ice more than forty-eight hours; but no ordinary iron steamship, built as the modern freight carrier is, could have got through the heavier ice that was met without incurring serious risk, if not without actual disaster. Since the foregoing was written, I have received a copy of the report of Lieut. Kay, United States Signal Service, to the Chief Signal Officer, on the conduct of the observations at Point Barrow in the Arctic. He gives as the greatest thickness of ice formed in one season 6 feet 3 inches. At Point Barrow the formation of ice on the shore is certainly influenced by the passage of a current of warm water passing through Bering Straits and setting northeast. Fox Channel has no such advantage, and I still think it possible that a sheet of ice 10 feet in thickness might be formed there in one season. L. Mathews, P.O. Box 10.

Jenkins, from New York bound to Newcastle, England, put in here damaged by ice. Captain Jenkins makes the following report: We left New York at noon on the 1st instant with a cargo of merchandise. On the 7th ice was met and that evening after dark we sailed right into an open bay of ice; it became impossible to force our way any farther and about midnight the plates close to the water line were cracked and damaged. The steamer's position at the time was about 48° 20' North and 58° West. The ice had closed in around her and as far as the eye could reach nothing was visible but a vast field of ice and there were immense bergs towering hundreds of feet above the surface, with their glittering pinnacles. North of latitude 45 seemed a solid field. Captain Jenkins states that he never saw so much ice in his life, particularly in the position and so early in the season. For four days the steamer was wedged in solid, and when at last it was managed to get her out she was headed at once for Halifax. She will be temporarily repaired here and proceed for her destination as soon as possible. The port warden will make a thorough inspection of the Ripon City tomorrow. He took a look at her today; although the vessel is leaking somewhat in the forward compartment, temporary repairs, he considers, will be quite sufficient to carry her safely across. The mail steamer Campion, which arrived at 8 a.m. today from Liverpool, had a mild passage across. On Friday last, in lat. 1:12, long. E. de Cossar, who is personally acquainted with King John and thinks not meanly of his talents and character, and of the prospects of his people under favorable circumstances, was of the opinion early last summer that if his good offices were sought, he would prove a valuable ally. Whether it is still possible or desirable to utilize his friendship in that way we do not know, but perhaps it has remained for Italy to avail herself of opportunities which England allowed to pass unused. It is also possible that the Abyssinians, seeing the Mahdi in possession, may be moved to try the chances of a march from Gellabat which, Sir S. Baker says, would be a direct descent upon Khartoum by the river Ilahad and the Blue Nile, through a fertile country teeming with supplies. Awkward as would, at other times, be such a move, whatever would engage the attention of the victorious Mahdi would be welcome at the present crisis. Though acting for herself, Abyssinia would in such a case be England's timely ally. HUDSON'S BAY NAVIGATION, The information acquired by Lieut. Gordon, who commanded the expedition to Hudson's Bay last summer, is necessarily of a partial and incomplete character, the journey being somewhat hurriedly made, and having for its object the establishment of observatory stations rather than the ascertainment of definite and large knowledge of the duration of navigation in the bay and straits. Such conclusions as can be drawn, however, from the observations made and the data obtained, point to the possibility of safely navigating these waters during three or four months of the year. The character of the ice met with is divided into three classes, having each a separate origin, namely: icebergs from the glaciers of Fox Channel, heavy Arctic field ice from the channel itself, and ordinary field ice formed on the shores of the bay and straits. Icebergs were not seen in Hudson's Bay, and in the straits those encountered are reported to have been not more numerous or more formidable than are met with off the Straits of Belle Isle. The ordinary field ice forms no barrier to the easy passage of steamers, but the heavy field ice attaining a depth of forty feet, and averaging last season quite fifteen feet in thickness, renders the progress of steamers and vessels impossible. This apparently serious drawback to navigation is qualified by Lieut. Gordon with the explanation that the season was an unusually severe one, and an unfair test of the character of the ice ordinarily encountered in the straits and bay during August and September. He expresses the opinion that the more formidable ice of this description was the result of an accumulation of several years. It is probable from the report that the expedition will have to be made and observations taken during three or four years in succession to solve with reasonable certainty the duration of the safe navigation of Hudson's Bay, and in view of the importance of the question to the Northwest, a definite settlement of the problem is well worth the expenditure involved. The great value of the fisheries of Hudson's Bay is made apparent by the report of Lieut. Gordon, from which it appears that New England whaling vessels have been engaged in these waters for many years past, and have taken therefrom in a recent period fish to the value of more than two million dollars, and that the catch per vessel averages nearly thirty thousand dollars. The Hudson's Bay Company also is extensively engaged in the fisheries of the bay, deriving therefrom considerable profit. The company has established extensive refineries at several of their northern stations, and instead of exporting the blubber of the porpoise in bulk, now refine it and ship the pure oil in casks. Fresh salmon in refrigerators are also largely exported to England where a ready and profitable market is found. In connection with this subject, Lieut. Gordon makes the timely suggestion that in any negotiations undertaken by the Canadian government looking to reciprocity of trade with the United States, the value of the fisheries of Hudson's Bay should receive due consideration. They are already valuable in character, largely availed of by the Americans, and likely to become more and more sought after as the resources of the region become better known, and pending a treaty it is desirable that such regulations should be framed as will prevent the use of explosives in the whale fisheries of Hudson's Bay, the effect of which is inevitably to rapidly exhaust the supply. Another undue advantage the Americans now enjoy is trading with the natives of the region. The Hudson's Bay Company, in trading, have to pay duties, and a considerable amount of money accrues to the government from customs dues on importations at Churchill, York, and Moose Factory, but every American whaler entering the bay is an unlicensed trader, carrying in American goods and trading with the natives, in unfair competition with the Hudson's Bay Company, whose goods pay duties. The French papers which have of late been prophesying the uprising of India should reflect that there is far more likelihood of an insurrection in Tunis and Algiers. The wave of fanaticism is more likely to sweep westward by its old route along the Mediterranean seaboard than it is to cross the Indian Ocean or to make its way through conflicting nations and tribes to beyond the Indus. It is the Sultan, if anyone, that should be concerned about the Mahdi's success. It is forgotten that Islam is not one any more than Christendom, and that the sword of the faithful has for long centuries been drawn as often against each other as against the giaour. The Canadian Gazette says: Many of the leading commercial men of the Dominion are actively supporting the action of our chambers of commerce, in regard to Canada's bankruptcy law. As will have been seen from our Dominion News last week, a very influential deputation waited on Sir John Macdonald on the subject, on his return from England, and evidently desired to strengthen in every way possible the impression produced on the mind of the Premier by the representations of the gentlemen who approached him on the matter whilst in London. Sir John addressed the deputation at some length, and from the general tenor of his remarks it is evident that while still recognizing the difficulties of the problem, he is resolved that the whole matter shall be considered most earnestly by the Government at the earliest date. The supreme importance of the question to the trade of Canada is fully recognized. These remarks are all the more to the point now that, as our readers are aware, a committee has been appointed to collect information on the subject from all the provinces. The Rev.",
18960427,historical,ice,"APRIL 27 A BREAK AT QUEBEC The Ice in Front of the City Passes Out THE CAP ROUGE JAM First Report Said It Had Also Broken But This Is Doubtful Quebec, April 26 (Special) The two remaining ice jams in the river gave way tonight, and now everything goes so far as obstructions to free navigation are concerned. All yesterday and all today, while the ferry crossed to and from Levis in perfectly clear water, a sheet of heavy ice from above jammed into the Quebec narrows of the river, extending right across from under the Citadel, just above the ferry crossing, to nearly a mile upstream. It was an object of much concern to shippers and of great interest to spectators and promenaders on Dufferin Terrace, thousands of whom were watching it at 7:15 tonight, when it suddenly broke and moved out with the falling tide. The ferry steamer Polaris had to run before it to seek shelter at Indian Cove, and the tug Spray was immediately dispatched downstream to meet the steamship Vancouver, which was then about due at that point, providing it had continued on its way upstream, and to warn it of the danger of the heavy ice, which it would thus have had time to avoid by turning about and seeking shelter downstream. Mingled with the ice that passed down for an hour and a half in front of the city was a large amount of debris of various kinds, and quite a quantity of logs, indicating that it had come, in part at least, from the Chaudiere, where so many bridges, houses, and logs were swept down into the St. Lawrence some days ago. It made a grating sound against the riverside wharves and dashed up lots of water, and some fear was experienced for the safety of the gas buoys on the Government wharf, but they were fortunately untouched. Everybody was engaged in discussing the probability of the ice jam at Cape Rouge still holding for some days, when at 9 o'clock telegraph and telephone messages came in from the Cape that it had given way, and from New Liverpool, Etchemin, Sillery, and Bridgewater Cove, to the effect that the lake ice and that from the Sillery jam were passing down together. This ends the blockade in the river, and though there will be floating masses of ice of considerable size carried up and down the stream in and about the harbor here for the next two or three tides, summer pontoons will be in their places in a day or two, and summer ferries to Levis, and the Island and the Montreal and Saguenay steamers will find no obstacles to contend with after a couple of days more. Ocean steamers will be able to ascend the river on Tuesday without any fear of damage here from ice. The fruit ships now in Indian Cove may not leave their haven there tomorrow, and it will altogether depend upon the manner in which the tides dispose of the ice whether the Vancouver will be able to round the point and make the Louise dock tomorrow. Had she arrived up during this afternoon before the jam broke, everything was ready for her entrance into the basin. The steamship Loughriggholme, previously reported here, with coal for Webster & Co., came up today from Indian Cove, and went into Louise Basin, where she will discharge tomorrow. The placing of the buoys in the river will commence on Tuesday. The first of the Cap Rouge and lake ice passed here shortly before midnight. The steamship Vancouver is anchored at Baie des Aulnaies. The steamer Spray, that left here just as the ice did, with Mr. Ramsay, of the Dominion Steamship Line, aboard, to intercept the Vancouver, had a narrow escape in getting out of the basin. She just cleared it as the descending ice struck the wharf. The Spray is now in shelter at St. Laurent. It is reported that portions of a lighthouse from some point between here and Montreal have been found, with other wreckage, in the ice, and Mr. S's immigration staff arrived here today for the season. Cap Rouge May be Solid Yet Quebec, April 27 Ice that passed here about midnight is not Cap Rouge ice at all, but Chaudiere Basin ice, Cap Rouge ice not having yet reached here. Experienced river men believe it has not moved at all, but that New Liverpool, Etchemin, Sillery, and Bridgewater Cove, who report it on the way, have all mistaken Chaudiere Basin ice for it and reported accordingly. There is not a telephone at Cap Rouge, and the telegraph company cannot raise their operator there. Being on 3 o'clock now, the non-arrival of ice from Cap Rouge casts doubts on original reports of the break of the jam. It is too late for correspondents to reach Cap Rouge over present roads in time to ascertain facts and get back here early enough to transmit intelligence. The Loughriggholme's Trip Up Quebec, April 25 Capt. Millican, of the steamship Loughriggholme, has forwarded to the Chronicle, of this city, the following report, which will prove of considerable interest to Montreal shippers: """"We left Louisburg at 6 a.m. on the 19th instant, with coals for Quebec. When off Cape Sottari found the ice close packed and heavy from the land to the north and east, as far as we could see from the masthead. Stood E.E. along the southern edge of ice for thirty miles, and so got round it and made for Cape North. At dark, finding the ice ahead, hove to for daylight. Started at daylight, 20th, and had to keep more northerly for St. Paul's. After passing through six miles of loose ice, stopped at Atlantic Cove and had a visit from the signalman and his friends, who were anxious to have a late paper, as the last one they saw was of the 1st April. He reported heavy ice at the Magdalen Islands, but had no news of the ice off Anticosti. The ice seemed close packed from St. Paul's to Cape North. After passing north of St. Paul's found clear water for quite a distance west of that Island, in which were two American schooners halibut fishing. Made Bird Rocks, but could not get near them, as the ice was pretty close for eight miles north of them, saw one three-masted schooner and several small schooners amongst this ice. Skirted round this ice and, dark coming on, hove to. At midnight a fresh gale sprang up from the northwest. Started at daylight against the still strong breeze and many short head seas. Saw Bird Rocks 14 miles off W.W. of us, but no ice was to be seen. The breeze dropped down to nothing, and we made Anticosti at daylight on the 22nd. Thence had fine weather; no ice. At 8 a.m. on the 23rd, got pilot at Bio and proceeded to River du Loup, where we anchored at 1 p.m., to keep the company of the Fremona and Flumoro, steamers bound for Montreal. After communicating with Mr. Harold Kennedy, and consulting pilot, we decided to start for Indian Cove, which we did at 7 a.m. this day. It seemed to us very pretty work to watch the way Pilot Joseph Larochelle picked his way along the banks by the lead, more especially was this observable coming through the Traverse, where the shore marks are so distant as to be hardly made out. Everything went well, and we made our way out safely, met no ice till we reached St. Laurent, but thence to town met quite a few large pieces, one of which gave us but bare room to pass it and keep clear of the ground. Spoke steamer Contest, who said he had got out of the Lachine, which gave us hopes of reaching that much-desired haven. We accordingly made for the entrance at 8 p.m., and hailed the shore for an opinion of our being able to enter, and the answer came, yes. We, however, did not get our rope ashore, when we were hailed again with the news the ice was coming down, and we had no time to get in, so there was no help, but we must run for Indian Cove, which we reached before the ice, and so made fast to await the breaking away of the ice. Steamships Reach Port The steamships Tiber and Acadian arrived in port on Saturday, from Sorel, to commence their season's work. The Tiber is in command of Capt. John Delisle, but the Acadian, which has recently been purchased from the Allan line, is in command of Capt. Joseph Delisle, the son of Capt. John Delisle. During the winter months the Acadian has been thoroughly overhauled, and she has now some first-class passenger accommodation. The Acadian will leave about Wednesday with a full general cargo for the Lower Provinces. Notice to Pilots Mr. Robertson, the Secretary of the Harbor Commissioners, received the following letter on Saturday from Mr. Gregory, the Agent at Quebec for the Department of Marine and Fisheries: """"I am notified that several lights above, notably Pointe aux Cèdres, near Batiscan, front light Contrecoeur, front light Les Raisins, front light L'Islet, Richelieu, front light Grondines, and probably others, have been more or less injured and cannot be relied upon as being in operation at present. Every effort is being made to remedy defects. Please notify pilots to be cautious."""" Notice In re Buoying of Channel The principal buoys are now planned between Montreal, via the Lavaltrie (or North) channel, and Three Rivers. Two boats will leave Sorel early tomorrow morning to begin placing the most important buoys below Three Rivers. First Arrival at Kingston Kingston, April 20 The schooner Annie Minns was the first sailing craft to arrive here from across the lake. She sailed Friday from Oswego, having left there on Thursday with a cargo of fresh mined Scranton coal. Capt. Savage is again on deck. He says that on the trip across much ice was encountered. The schooner was obliged to round up at Pigeon Island and sail back to the upper gap, entering the harbor by that route. An Obstruction In Lake Huron Colchester, Ont., April 25 The steam barge Teutonia, with two consorts, ran foul of a wreck two miles west of here, and almost directly in the channel, last night, and is still fast. The obstruction is supposed to be the remains of the schooner Gibbs, sunk about three years ago off Bar Point. It was brought down by the ice last winter. The vessel is being lightened. For Coal Service Portsmouth, N.H., April 25 The Dominion Coal Company has chartered four large schooners, the Sarah E. Palmer, Mary E. Palmer, Augustus Palmer, and Win. L. Palmer, to carry coal from Nova Scotia to Boston. Disasters London, April 25 The steamer Bushmills, from New Orleans for Dromon, has arrived at Plymouth, where she landed the crew of the American schooner Eunice L. Crocker, Captain Croaker, from Fernandina, March 10, for Boston, which was abandoned at sea April 10, waterlogged. The schooner's crew state that they remained on board the wreck of their vessel for a week after she lost her masts and became waterlogged, and that when they abandoned her they set her on fire. London, April 25 The British barque Mozambique, Captain Strachan, from Rio Janeiro, for New York, was spoken April 13 in lat. 5 S, long. 3'W. Signalled that five of her crew had died from yellow fever. London, April 25 It has been found unnecessary to dry dock the German steamer California, before reported damaged by collision at Hamburg with the collier Tyne-mouth. The work of repairing the steamer will be completed by Tuesday next. The British barque Maiden City, from Liverpool, previously reported ashore at Santos, in an exposed position, will prove a wreck. The Swedish barque Marianne, Captain Tjernberg, from London, November 27, for Darien, which was towed to Dover, December 7, in need of extensive repairs, has been sold and her hulk dismantled. San Francisco, April 25 The British ship Craigmore, bound from Newcastle, N.S., to San Francisco with a cargo of coal, is out 83 days, and not a few shipping and insurance men believe she burned at sea. The ships Nairnshire and Prince James, from Newcastle, are also causing a good deal of alarm. The Nairnshire is now over 130 days from Burmoh and the James is out over 100 days from South America. All three carry cargoes of Cardiff coal. St. John's, Nfld, April 23 The British steamer Clenlivet arrived here today from Cadiz, laden with salt. Her bow plates were crushed by her coming in contact with ice and she is leaking badly. She reports meeting heavy bodies of ice 150 miles off the coast. One hundred and thirty-eight icebergs of various sizes are in sight off Cape Race and are floating in the southern track of shipping. Detroit, Mich., April 25 The steamer Philip Minch, bound down in tow of the tug Thompson, collided with whaleback No. 101 in the river here yesterday. The pumps of the whaleback kept her free until Lake St. Clair was reached, when the water began to make very fast and the barge sank near the lightship; wreckers are working on the sunken vessel. She is laden and owned by the American Barge Company and is valued at $75,000.

18870425,historical,ice or flood?,"THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL APRIL 25, 1887: THE DAY OF THE FLOOD, Only Very Slight Abatement of the Waters, THE WORK OF RELIEF PROGRESSING What was Being Done on Sunday in the Inundated District, Another day has come and gone, and, though a slight abatement of the water has taken place, it cannot at this writing be said that the signs of immediate relief are visible. The ice in front of the city moved down slightly, and just below and above the Victoria bridge when the darkness came on last night, the river was clear, but in front of the city, and down as far as the eye could reach, the ice masses were piled in ragged confusion. A slight movement took place throughout the day, and for a time there was visible a streak of water towards the St. Lawrence shore, but later it closed up. The ice has shoved somewhat towards the Montreal side, and Commissioners street, which was only covered with water, is now occupied by masses of ice, which, in many places, lie close to the buildings. Telegraphic and telephonic communication was cut off last night, and it was impossible to get accurate information of what was transpiring either up or down the river, but the report was that the remainder of the Lake St. Louis ice was coming down. What the effect will be is difficult to say, but the very slow fall in the water level that commenced on Friday night continued, with occasional slight rises, and at two o'clock this morning the gauge at the Harbour Commissioners office registered 41 feet 10 inches, which is 1 foot 2 inches lower than the highest point indicated. The area of high water has extended downwards and the village at Longue Pointe is partially inundated. The work of relieving the wants of the inundated sufferers has been well carried out, and very few deserving cases are believed to have been overlooked. The misery is thus reduced to the smallest possible extent, but is still very great, and must have been increased by the rain of Saturday and the fall in temperature last night. Punctual at 7:30 o'clock, on Saturday morning, the members of the Relief committee, comprising Aid. Stevenson (chairman), P. Kennedy, Malone, Jeanotte, McBride, Donovan, Laurent, were in attendance at McGill street, and engaged in loading boats and dispatching them to Griffintown and Point St. Charles. Throughout the day the worthy aldermen worked like Trojans, all being saturated to the skin by the pouring rain. At noon the order to Eraser, Viger & Co. was quadrupled, and at night orders were given to ensure an ample supply for the morning. THE UPPER ICE, Mr. Couvrette, the diver who put down the penstock gates, and who has been engaged in the blasting operations in the river, on Saturday afternoon in conversation stated that the only ice which had come down as yet was from Chateauguay and Pointe Claire bays. The ice in Lake St. Louis was still firm and was green and two and a half feet. If this did come down before the jam was got rid of, the flood would be the biggest that Montreal ever had experienced. This jam had been ascertained to be opposite Longue Pointe, and he had received orders from Mr. O'Brien to go down that afternoon and have everything in readiness for blasting. He was of the opinion that the blasting operations ought to have been, in the first instance, carried up to Victoria bridge. In regard to the sidewalks he had invented a floating sidewalk which would rise and fall with the water for Griffintown. This was attached so that it could not be removed and being continuous, when the flood came residents in the flooded districts could have dry communication with their neighbors and other parts of the town, without needing to resort to vehicles and boats. He had shown this invention to Mr. G. Nish and Mr. Salisbury, two engineers, and they highly approved of it, but Mr. St. George, the city surveyor, did not. IN MANY OF THE CITY CHURCHES, In many of the city churches yesterday reference was made to the flood and prayers were offered that it be stayed and for the relief of the sufferers by it. AS VIEWED FROM THE CITY HALL, A representative of the Gazette viewed the river from the tower of the City hall yesterday afternoon. In the early part of the afternoon there was quite a large expanse of clear water between Hochelaga and the lower portion of St. Helen's island, but about 3 o'clock the ice above St. Helen's island commenced to move, and soon the water which had a short time before been free of ice, was completely covered, and a large expanse of clear water could be seen above Victoria bridge as far up as Laprairie bay. But from Victoria bridge down the river, as far as the eye could reach, no clear water could be seen. However, the blockade of ice between St. Helen's island and the south shore showed signs of moving, and by 6 o'clock the south channel was clear of ice. Above Laprairie the river appeared to be covered by ice from shore to shore, and one gentleman who was in the tower of the City hall at the time, who has watched the action of the river ice for several years, remarked that he feared this ice would move down the river in the evening, and that if it did, we might expect a rapid rise of the water and a more serious inundation than had yet been experienced. The scene, as one looked down the river, was a grand one, the solid blocks of ice with which it was covered being here and there dotted with miniature mountains, and long black streaks of dirty ice, where the winter roads were made, being discernible on all sides. AT THE BACK RIVER, The water gradually receded at the Back River, and that place is now dry. During the flood the saw mills of Messrs. McNiven & Cole were flooded so rapidly that the employees barely had time to escape. Thousands of pieces of timber and some thirty cords of wood were floated off, while half a mile further down the river might be seen the coal shed, an immense building, built to cover 300 tons of coal, which had been carried off bodily. Mr. Nivan estimates his loss at $2,000. The general store of Mr. Theophile Paquet was flooded as high as the counter, and he will lose considerably by damage to his stock. At Dr. Chopin's house on the other side of the road, the water covered the first flat some eighteen inches. The late Mayor Brouseau's house had some six feet of water in the basement. Visitation island was completely covered, but one house escaping. The house of Adolph Lapointe on the river bank was filled with water to within one foot of the roof, while a little further down might be seen the house of Joseph Menard, which was struck by the ice and completely overturned. OBSERVATIONS OF THE RIVER, The south channel was observed open to Longueuil on either side, and the ice was piled very high at Longueuil and Boucherville islands. A movement of the ice downwards at Isle Gros Bois was observed from the top of the Harbour Commissioners' building at 6 o'clock yesterday evening. P. and Mr. Desjardins, M.P., are getting the members representing the counties affected by the flood to wait upon the Government to urge them to take immediate steps to deal with the matter. The police of No. 9 station reported at 3 o'clock this morning that the water had risen about an inch within the hour. In cellars flooded from the Craig street tunnel also a slight increase in height seemed noticeable. The omnibus service on St. Antoine street has been resumed, the horses being driven through the water. The Notre Dame street route is broken near Chaboillez square, and the Point St. Charles service is discontinued altogether. The Richelieu & Ontario company's officials state that the ice on the Richelieu river is coming down quietly, and that the company's boats have sustained no damage. It is expected that one of the Quebec boats will be here by the 2nd of May. A rumor was prevalent in the city last evening to the effect that two men had been arrested at St. Gabriel while attempting to open the sluice gates and let the water in upon Point St. Charles. The rumor could not be traced to any reliable authority. A brick house, occupied by Mr. St. Charles, on the river bank near the fall race, has been partially destroyed by the ice. The furniture was quickly taken out in boats, as the balance of the house threatened to come down. The house will probably be a total loss, as the part left standing will very likely have to be pulled down. During the evening the police while out in a patrol boat noticed a man named Kenny taking a barrel of oil on a raft along Wellington street. As he could not give a satisfactory explanation as to where he had got it they arrested him. It was afterwards ascertained that it had been taken from Messrs. Chaput & Co.'s store, corner of St. Peter and Commissioners streets. A gentleman who had just returned from Lachine last evening stated that the Lake St. Louis ice had commenced to come down about 5 o'clock, which will probably account for the sudden rise in the water about that hour. Reports from Beauharnois state that the ice is breaking up there and coming down. The telegraph wires in many directions are down, however, and no accurate information can be obtained. THE SHOVE FOLLOWED BY A BLOCK AND A FLOOD, Thuri Rivers, April 23, The ice which floated away from Grondines and Peschambault yesterday, blocked at Port Neuf and the river, which fell rapidly during that shove, is now rising again. The streets are flooded and families in the lower portion of the town are flitting to their friends on the higher lots.

18940330,historical,ice,"It was ice, and lots of it, that impeded the progress of the freight steamship State of Georgia from Aberdeen to this port. She got in yesterday morning with her forepeak flooded to the water line and a hole nine feet long and four feet high in her starboard bow. She took a high northerly course, where her skipper might reasonably expect to find Arctic conditions, and, on March 13, east of the Banks of Newfoundland, she struck into pack ice that forced her to slow down to quarter speed. She tried to push her way through, but the further she steamed the thicker the ice seemed to get, and she was at length compelled to steer to the eastward. Then they discovered that she was leaking forward and detected the injury to her bow. Her progress was infinitesimal and when a thick fog came on Captain Laurie decided to stop her and let her drift, as he feared she might crash into an iceberg. At 8 a.m. the next day, while the ship was going ahead, the skipper saw through the mist what appeared to be a dense fog bank on the starboard. He kept on his course until he noticed that the fog bank had assumed a greenish hue. Then he knew that he was within hailing distance of a gigantic berg, and he put his helm hard up, and missed the apparition by less than a ship's length. The intense coldness of the air convinced the skipper that he was in the neighborhood of a fleet of bergs, and he proceeded with much caution. At 4 p.m. the ice and the fog were so thick that the ship's engines were stopped again, and she drifted with the packed ice. The pumps connected with the forepeak had been sounded, and it was found that the inrush of the sea was too much for them to clear. The collision bulkheads, just forward of the chain locker, had been closed, and the leakage was confined to the forepeak. While the ship was drifting Captain Laurie and the carpenter were lowered over the starboard bow on a staging and made an inspection of the damage. They decided that there was danger of the wound extending by the steady pressure of the ice, and they constructed a """"collision mat,"""" made of two timbers nine feet long, across which were nailed, as in a boardwalk, pieces of plank four feet long and two and a half inches thick. The face of this was covered with oakum. To the middle of each end timber a chain was fastened, and to the free end of each chain a hawser was bent. The chain and hawser on the lower edge of the mat were passed over to starboard under the ship's bow and made fast on deck on the port side. The chain and hawser on the upper edge were made taut as the mat was fitted over the breach caused by the ice. The lengths of chain were used because a hawser would have chafed on the keel and the rail. The nose of the steamship looked as if it were in a sling. A smaller patch was put over a hole in the ship's port bow. The work was finished at 7 p.m. and, the fog having lifted and revealed lighter ice to the southeast, the ship was headed that way. She passed a dozen or more bergs with fantastic towers, peaks and minarets, and many solid chunks of green ice that projected twenty feet above the water, and in a fog were more dangerous than bergs. Five hours after her wounds had been dressed the bandages were torn off by seas piled up by westerly gales. The skipper and his engineer and carpenter examined the collision damage, which was strengthened by chain piled in the chain locker, and decided that it was not necessary to bandage the ship's nose again. They were somewhat fearful when the seas were high, and they looked over the bow and saw, as the ship rose on a tall wave, the gaping wound, that more plates might be ripped off. Whenever the ship rose on a wave she spilled a cataract from the gap. The skipper contradicted a report that a submarine had tied into the hole. He said, however, that there was a small fish there yet, and that he proposed to secure it as a memento when the ship was put in dry dock. Mr. Fay mil' Critics, To the Editor of the Gazette: Sir, I would like to say to the party whose nom de plume is 'An Outsider' that it would be well if, before becoming too confused and dumbfounded in the toils and snares of doubt and fear, he would call on the Rev. Dr. A. trophies. These little emblems are in the shape of watch charms, and are very handsome as well as valuable. An Insurance Hatch, There is one good thing about insurance, and that is that the gentlemen engaged in it can afford to take chances that ordinary mortals would not. If anything should happen to them, of course, they are all insured in their own companies, and then they all know where the damages will come in. At least that was what people said last night when the ambulance bells disturbed the slumbers of the good people on Drummond street. They were simply caused by the urgent demands of various non-insured hockey players, who discovered that even moderately soft ice was considerably harder than the average insurance man's head. The headgear, too, was only a comparatively small portion of the anatomy injured. These gentlemen wisely refrained from getting themselves into trouble until the season was over, thereby not setting a bad example to any of their clients. The Guardians did not live up to their name. They were not guardians; in fact, they were rather the other thing and appeared as if they were standing in with the coroner and wanted a few more figures added to the mortality statistics that the London & Lancashire want to keep down. But the match that promises to be one of the features of annual sport took place, and there was not enough skin lost after all, as MacShaughnessy would say, to make a cornet of hussars. How they managed to amuse the spectators for a whole hour can only be appreciated by those who were there, for lives were insured on one side and the ice could not be burned. The match wound up by the Guardians taking the London & Lancashire men into camp with a score of 6 to 1. ATHLETICS; Valleyfield Amateur Athletic Association, The annual general meeting of the above association was held in the Town Hall in Valleyfield last evening, and the meeting was largely attended.

18990114,historical,torrential,"T. Time Gen Henry I. Abbott arrived here yesterday from France on the steamship La Champagne. He was accompanied by M. Charon, said to be connected with the new Panama Canal Company. Gen Abbott was a member of the International Technical Commission, composed of engineers of the United States, France, Kuaalat, England, Germany, and Colombia, which recently made an inspection of the plans and work and suggested changes in the route of the Panama Canal. He is on his way to Washington to submit to the Government the information he possesses regarding the Interoceanic waterway at the Isthmus of Panama. He said yesterday that the French Government has no longer anything to do with the proposed canal, and the new company could dispose of its interest in the work to the United States without opposition from any source, provided the terms offered were satisfactory. The new canal company, with the 65,000,000 francs which it possessed when it secured the control of the cut, has simply been doing the preliminary work necessary on account of the mistaken ideas of the old engineers. No obstacles, such as the overflow of the Chagres River during the period of freshets, have been arranged for, and the old idea of making connection between ocean and ocean a tidewater one has been modified, so that the part yet to be finished will be built on the lock principle. Two-fifths of the entire canal work is now actually completed, and the balance is under active construction, with 2,000 workmen and a large force of engineers. Thus far, a distance of about fourteen miles of the tidewater part of the canal on the Atlantic side has been completed and is navigable to vessels drawing not more than twenty-eight feet of water. There are a few bars that only need dredging to make it passable for vessels of greater depth. Beyond that point, there has been considerable excavation to the twenty-one mile line from the Atlantic. Over four miles of the tidewater work on the Pacific side of the canal have also been finished. General Abbott declared that the new plans are perfectly feasible, and that the canal can be completed in one-half the time and at much less cost than it will take to dig the Nicaragua Canal. """"Were the two routes compared today,"""" he continued, """"eight vessels to one would prefer the Panama route, because it is only forty-six miles across, and the Nicaragua course will be four times that length, and the windings of the San Juan River are very short and sharp. There is no reason why this country should not take hold of and finish the Panama cut."""" President McKinley has recently been furnished with a full report of the International Technical Commission, and the present status of the canal may be the means of the abandonment of the Nicaragua project by the United States in favor of the Panama route. The report of the commission is probably the most authoritative document ever presented on an engineering subject. It has been prepared with the greatest care, after the most thorough and competent investigation and examination, with the most exhaustive surveys before the members. The surveys cover every foot of the ground to be treated, and were prepared by the most experienced engineers of five different nations. At the present time, the topography of all the grounds involved in the project, and the character of the materials to be encountered, are accurately known and delineated, and no doubt is left as to the soundness of the materials through which the canal is to be dug to great depths, and on which the foundations of the locks, dams, and other structures are to be established. """"The original purpose of the old company was to build a canal without locks, freely open from ocean to ocean, but after several years of work, the plan was abandoned, owing to the enormous excavation necessary to cut through the central mass of the mountains (the Culebra) and the difficulty and expense of properly taking care of the occasional torrential flow of the River Chagres. The alternate plan which has been adopted by the new company is to reduce materially the depth of the central excavation and to establish therein a system of locks, to be fed from the Chagres River in order properly to regulate the flow of the river; two large dams will be erected. One of the dams will be situated at Bohio, at the last group of locks on the Atlantic side. This dam transforms the Chagres into a vast lake, which will extend to Obispo, a distance of thirteen miles, and will cover an area of over twenty-one square miles. The dam, besides acting as a regulator of the Chagres floods, will obviate strong currents where the canal traverses the bed of the river, an extremely important matter for ocean shipping. The other dam will be situated at Alhajuela, on the Upper Chagres, about nine and one-third miles from the canal. It will form a reservoir covering ten miles, which will be a feeder to the summit level of the canal and will assist in regulating the flow of the Chagres. It will also furnish hydraulic power, transmitted by electricity, for operating the locks and lighting at night the entire canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific. """"Both dams can consequently accumulate a storage of at least 68,000,000,000 gallons, which, with proper adjustable weirs, will be more than sufficient to control the largest freshets known. The time of transit for vessels through the canal will be less than a day. Merchant and war vessels of the largest size can be accommodated. """"The estimates of the cost of the completion of the canal have been established from the experience acquired during the last four years of actual work on the isthmus, and are reported by the Technical Commission as follows: Cost of the work proper under plans adopted, $87,000,000; add for contingencies, $15,400,000; total $102,400,000. If both locks be built with a width of 82.025 feet, the cost would be increased to $125,000,000. """"Such, in brief, is the present state of the Panama Canal, and if this Government does not take advantage of the chance now offered, the waterway at the Isthmus will be completed by private capital. It will then be in operation years before the rival scheme proposed across Nicaragua could be finished, and, being a shorter route from ocean to ocean, would be a financial success, while the other cut, if ever carried out, would be a failure in more ways than one."""" A NEW PICTURE ON WHICH BURNE-JONES WAS WORKING EIGHTEEN YEARS The chief topic of conversation in English artistic circles just now is the unfinished and never exhibited """"Arthur in Avalon,"""" the vast picture on which Burne-Jones was engaged for eighteen years, and which had not received the last touches when death called upon him to cease his work forever. It is a huge canvas measuring more than 10 feet by 11 feet. Burne-Jones always intended it to rank as the great work of his life, and in no picture did he expend so much thought and positive labor. Although it is catalogued as unfinished, and although he so regarded it, it had very nearly reached completion; to most judgments, indeed, it would pass as a finished picture, though the artist intended to put more work into the heads and some other parts of the composition. The design represents the king lying asleep on a couch in the midst of a marble cloister; over his head is a canopy of gilt bronze, adorned with designs from the history of the Holy Grail. The three queens are at the head and foot of the couch; maidens, with musical instruments, are seated in front; three squires standing to the right keep the king's armory while other figures on either hand are holding horns or trumpets, or waiting for the signal which is to awaken the king. Like most of the painter's latest creations, the picture suggests tapestry, just as his early work used to suggest stained glass; but it is lovely tapestry, and by those who appreciate the quiet key of color which characterizes his later works, this """"Avalon"""" will be found to be one of the most satisfying of any. In many ways, indeed, the last period of Burne-Jones was not so good as the period that came a little earlier; his types became exaggerated and he tended to repeat himself. But for all that, """"Arthur in Avalon"""" must always rank as one of his most important pictures, and the very dimensions of it seem to designate it for a public gallery. NEW CURES FOR CONSUMPTION Results of a Russian Surgeon's Injections of Natrum and Cinnamyllcum London Telegraph St. Petersburg December 25 Some interesting reports have been current recently concerning the discovery by a Russian physician of a new method of treating consumption, which is said to have already given brilliant results. As is well known, none of the new cures for consumption, not even excepting that of Prof. Koch, have been very successful, but it is stated that the experiments made by Dr. Lovsky with natrum cinnamyllcum have turned out very well. I am, of course, not a medical expert, and therefore I can only write of what I hear at a recent meeting of the Society of Medicine in this country, at which Dr. Lovsky presented an account of his discovery. He gave particulars of five cases upon which he had produced visible effects by injections of natrum cinnamyllcum. At the outset, the doctor stated that at the beginning of the treatment, all the patients were suffering from what the faculty regarded as the most painful form of tuberculosis, but that in the course of a short period their health was re-established sufficiently to enable them to return to work. He said that treatment by natrum cinnamyllcum in the form of balsam of Peru had been tried by Landerer in 1888 in cases of surgical tuberculosis. He used the balsam as an emulsion with gum arabic and tried it with success in 170 cases. Following Landerer, a whole series of medical men carried on experiments, trying also other preparations of the balsam, and in 1887 works were published on the subject by Dr. Goutcharenko and other doctors. In all cases, the results were favorable, and this circumstance induced Dr. Lovsky to undertake his essays, using injections under the shoulder blades. The invalids were divided into three categories: first, those with changes in the form of the lungs, both with and without hollows; secondly, those with changes, not only in the lungs, but in other parts of the lungs; thirdly, those with the dangerous form of miliary tuberculosis. The results obtained were mixed. One patient was in a desperate condition and died a few days later; another, having felt relief, came no more for treatment. The rest were present at the meeting of the society. Of these patients, one, a doorman, who had no regular nourishment, came to Dr. Lovsky in March of the present year. He had a strong cough, severe perspiration, and feverishness; diminution of vital power had prevented him from following his business, and the diagnosis clearly showed that he was suffering from tuberculosis. The injections of natrum cinnamyllcum were commenced on March 13, and were repeated every three or four days. For the first two months, there was no sign of amelioration in his condition, but afterward it soon appeared, and the symptoms subsided. He gained eight pounds in weight, despite his insufficient food, and he is now in good health and able to follow his occupation. From March 15 to the present time, he has received fifty-three injections in the region of the shoulder blade. Patient No. 2 was in a very bad way, and galloping consumption was even feared. In April last, he had four injections and was ordered to drink koumiss. His condition soon improved, and although bacilli are still to be detected, they are far less numerous, and he seems to be getting on well. Patient No. 3 was a young man twenty-eight years of age. His treatment began on September 15, and by November 22, his weight had increased, and although his state had been very grave, the bacilli had disappeared at the end of eighty days; he felt well and was able to work. The other cases were of similar character. ON THE CONTINENT Vienna, January 13 A terrible gale has been raging here since early this morning. Much damage has been done to property, and there have been many accidents. Berlin, January 13 Reports received here late this afternoon describe a violent gale in northern and western Germany, and thunderstorms and torrential rains in southern Germany. At Stuttgart, a large scaffolding was blown down and a man killed. Dieppe, January 13 The destruction of the locality here by the storm has blocked the channel with girders. The packet boat from England to connect here with the express for Paris was unable to enter the harbor this evening and was obliged to return to New Haven with her passengers. Immense damage has been done to the Plage Gardens and Casino here, and at Tourville the gale has worked similar injury, the beach being torn up and the valley flooded for an area of three kilometers. Ten chalets facing the sea have been destroyed, forty bathing boxes washed away, and the Casino wrecked. At Le Treport, sixteen miles northeast of Dieppe, the Casino was partly carried out to sea and many chalets have been damaged. The whole coast is strewn with debris. London, January 13 The gale appeared to be passing in the direction of Russia. There is still many hours' delay in telegraph communication from the continent, and it is feared that accounts of serious ravage there will soon be received. A dispatch from Brest says that along the Finisterre coast a large quantity of wreckage has come ashore with carcasses of sheep and cattle, and it is believed that a large ship has foundered. Heavy damage is already reported from Ostend, Blankenberge, about nine miles northwest of Bruges, and other coastal towns.",

In dealing with his subject, Dr. Dawson remarked that great interest attaches to any remains which, in countries historically so old, may indicate the residence of man before the dawn of history. In Egypt, nodules of flint are very abundant in the Eocene limestones, and where these have been wasted away, remain on the surface. In many places there is good evidence that the flint thus to be found everywhere has been, and still is, used for the manufacture of flukes, knives, and other implements. These, as is well known, were used for many purposes by the ancient Egyptians, and in modern times gun-flints and strike-lights still continue to be made. The debris of worked flints found on the surface is thus of little value as an indication of any flint-folk preceding the old Egyptians. It would be otherwise if flint implements could be found in the older gravels of the country. Some of these are of Pleistocene age, and belong to a period of partial submergence of the Nile Valley. Flint implements had been alleged to be found in those gravels, but there seemed to be no good evidence to prove that they are other than the chips broken by mechanical violence in the removal of the gravel by torrential action. In the Lebanon, numerous caverns exist. These were divided into two classes, with reference to their origin; some being water-caves or tunnels of subterranean rivers, others sea-caves, excavated by the waves when the country was at a lower level than at present. Both kinds have been occupied by man, and some of them undoubtedly at a time anterior to the Phoenician occupation of the country, and even at a time when the animal inhabitants and geographical features of the region were different from those of the present day. They were thus of various ages, ranging from the post-Glacial or Antediluvian period to the time of the Phoenician occupation. Dr. Dawson then remarked that many geologists in these days had an aversion to using the word """"Antediluvian,"""" on account of the nature of the work which, in years now gone by, unlearned people had attributed to the flood described in Scripture, but as the aversion to the use of that word was, he thought, not called for in these days, he hoped it would pass away. Speaking as a geologist, from a purely geological point of view, and from a thorough examination of the country around, there was no doubt that there was conclusive evidence that between the time of the first occupation of these caves by men—and they were men of a splendid physique—and the appearance of the early Phoenician inhabitants of the land, there had been a vast submergence of land, and a great catastrophe, aye a stupendous one, in which even the Mediterranean had been altered from a small sea to its present size. In illustration of this, the caverns at the Pass of Nahr-el-Kelb and at Ant Elias were described in some detail, and also, in connection with these, the occurrence of flint implements on the surface of modern sandstones at the Cape of Has near Beirut; these last were probably of much less antiquity than those of the more ancient caverns. A discussion ensued, which was taken part in by a number of distinguished Fellows of the Royal Society, including Sir H. Barkly, F.",

18941218,historical,torrential,"U1ASCE AND MADAGASCAR The French have taken the first step towards spending the recent vote of $12,500,000 by occupying Tamatave, and no doubt the news will be received at Paris with great enthusiasm, though this is only the first and simplest step in the undertaking. Evidently the whole nation has been smitten by the war fever. The legislative bodies could not withstand the pressure of popular excitement and passed the vote by large majorities. In their heart of hearts many members of the Senate and the Chamber probably know better, and would vote against the expedition if they dared. But France has got herself into such a position with regard to Madagascar that she must either go on or withdraw, and in the present state of public feeling withdrawal is impossible. What France is to gain by the expedition is not clear; and the loss she risks is not merely of money and soldiers' lives, but of national honor. No doubt France can crush Madagascar if she puts forth her energies, but the operation may be a very expensive one. The Hovas are said to have a reserve of 70,000 men, well supplied with rifles and modern artillery. The difficulty of the expedition is greatly increased by the nature of the country. Of the road from Tamatave to the capital, an English resident in Madagascar says: Speaking generally the route is an endless succession of hills. Here and there are short easy stages, but for the greater part the French troops will have to cut their way, two or three abreast at the most, in the beds of gullies made by the torrential rains. At other points they will have to cut their way through dense, fever-laden forest. Even with small parties it often happens that the porters have literally to drag one another out of the thick, red mud in which they sink to their waist. From the top of the hills and rocks a mere handful of Hovas could, without danger to themselves, seriously harass the troops toiling hundreds of feet below them. It is evident that the French force, which is to consist of 15,000 troops in the first instance, will have no easy task before them. If the Hovas have anything like the military discipline and modern weapons they are given credit for, they will offer a serious resistance, and it may be that the French will meet a more destructive foe in the malarial fever. Even if the Hovas give way and the expedition proves a success, what return is the French government likely to get for its expenditure? The island is said to be unsuitable for European colonization, and if it offered a good field, the French would not colonize it. The population of France is practically at a standstill, and the government has no need to seek room for expansion. It does so merely from a foolish national jealousy of England, whose small size and overflowing population make colonization and colonial trade an absolute necessity. The French of today have neither the circumstances nor the characteristics which impel young Englishmen to emigrate. The young Frenchman is happy at home; he thinks France the finest country in the world, and he looks upon emigration as exile. Before national feeling had reached its present fever heat, the oro spoke out plainly: France will never colonize Madagascar, and nobody wants it but those to whom the island will be the happy hunting-ground of functionaries, of exotic banks, and of railways without passengers or traffic. This is what will happen if all goes well; but if disaster comes, the story of Tonquin will be repeated, and the Government which is now keeping in power by yielding to the popular voice will be swept out of office amid universal execration. The news of the unexpected death of Robert Louis Stevenson will bring to many of his admirers the pain of a personal loss. His genial, beautiful, cheerful spirit endeared him to thousands who knew him, and in the passing away of such a gentle spirit English literature sustains a loss we can ill afford. Stevenson had none of the pessimism and cynicism which mark some of our modern novelists. He was thoroughly human, and it is his entire humanity that gives his stories their greatest charm. It is because of this quality that we follow with breathless interest the adventures of his freebooters and wild Highland men and simple Lowland youths or English sailor boys. He had also in high degree the gift of romantic imagination. For the first time in English literature he united the pictureness of Scott with the exactness of Defoe. Careful workmanship and distinction of style made his books as delightful to the literary critic as to the schoolboy. No greater boon can be given to the young people than to make them acquainted with his stirring tales and charming essays. The next move against the liquor trade in this province is to be for the purpose of separating the sale of intoxicants from that of other articles of merchandise. The host of petitions presented in the Legislature yesterday is evidently the reconnaissance in force that is intended to precede the real attack. There are such reasons in favor of the change asked for that it has been adopted in many places. The temperance element has been having so much to say in shaping the laws here of late, too, that it is not unlikely that Quebec may before long be among them. There will be a great outcry from the Lancashire cotton spinners at the renewal of the proposal to levy a tax on cotton imports into India; but so long as the theory is held that India is governed for her own benefit and not for the advantage of England, one does not see how for the sake of English interests the administrators of Indian affairs can be restrained from doing what they say is absolutely necessary for India's welfare. At the same time, it is a severe blow to the Manchester school of free trade delivered in their tenderest spot: their pockets. Sir Charles H. Tupper appears by the reports to have been subjected to a good many interruptions at some of his British Columbia meetings. Liberals, when they feel they are getting the worst of the situation, have a weakness for resorting to such tactics. One of the worst interrupted meetings ever held in Canada was that in the Montreal drill shed, called by the Conservatives, just previous to the overthrow of the provincial Liberals in 1892. Before it Montreal had two Conservatives in the Legislature; after it she had six. The conduct of the Toronto Street Railway Co. in employing detectives to watch the judge and counsel conducting the boodling investigation is, to say the least of it, most extraordinary. When suspected persons employ detectives to investigate the private lives of the magistracy it is getting things down pretty fine, and a boodler has been correctly defined by a Montreal judge as the meanest kind of thief. Mr. Gigault's report on the success of the dairy industry in Denmark shows that Canada has yet abundant room for expansion in that direction. Close attention to the peculiarities of the English market is the first condition of success, and on this head the report contains suggestions to which Quebec farmers will do well to give heed. A vessel from Canada has been refused a permit to land cattle at Antwerp because of the prevalence of foot and mouth disease in this country. Either the cable has made a mistake or the man who gave the order did. The Belgian authorities seem to be imitating the British in crediting Canada with faults it does not possess. Another British warship is on its way to China. There must be quite a powerful British fleet now watching the progress of events at the principal Chinese ports. If Great Britain should feel called upon to interfere with the contestants, she would be able to intervene to some purpose.",
18960728,historical,torrential,"BRITISH LIVE STOCK Cooler Weather Brings Better Prices for Cattle BUT MARKET STILL LOW Details of the Market - Only Three to Three and a Half Cents Paid in Canada Can Make Money (From our own Correspondent) Liverpool, July 18 After fourteen days' dreadfully hot weather, a complete change in the atmospheric conditions now prevails almost generally throughout the Kingdom, and instead of sweltering under 87 to 90 in the shade, we are slipping on an extra coat and wondering how it can feel so cold at 65. The change has been decidedly beneficial to the meat and cattle trade, and although it only made itself apparent on Thursday, it seems likely to keep up for a few days. Values for cattle are from to 1c stronger, and lightweight beasts of good quality might have made 1c more. The run of stock, however, from Canada and the States, has, as a rule, been to the heavy side, and consequently it has not been possible to make the most of the change. Advices from London report a steadier demand at Deptford and a fair good clearance at Smithfield. This will give some encouragement to our Birkenhead operators and induce a more active demand. Altogether the prospect is not so bad, and if exporters can now buy suitable stock at 3c to 3½c, and ship them on a 40s or 42s 6d freight, they can stand our markets with some degree of composure. LONDON DEPTFORD Monday's supply of 3,535 beasts, compared with Monday last, showed an increase of 937 head, and consisted of 1,710 from the States, 1,864 from Canada (the largest consignment this season), and 431 from South America. Owing to the large number on offer, combined with the hot weather, trade was very dull, rates being fully 1d per lb in favor of buyers for prime quality, and a still further decline for seconds, at which sales had to be forced and a clearance was almost impossible. The very best States and Canadians made 2s 1½d to 3s per lb. Argentines nominally quoted at 2s 4d to 2s 6d. The sheep supply, amounting to 1,987, was 171 larger than on Monday last, and consisted of shipments from Argentina. Trade was steady with an earlier clearance than usual. Best pens made 3s 1½d per 8 lbs. The following were the numbers on offer on the corresponding day, with the current top rates: Beasts, 2,873, 3s 10d to 3s 11d per 8 lbs; sheep, 4,115, 3s 10d to 4s per 8 lbs. On Thursday trade improved remarkably owing to the clearance reported at Smithfield (but forced at shocking prices) and the cooler weather following upon the heavy torrential rains pretty general over the country. The supply consisted of 1,538 States and 337 Canadian cattle. This did not, however, include all arrivals, a good many being kept in reserve for Monday and also to fill any requirements on Friday, Saturday or Sunday, the demand at times for extra orders occasionally helping out a bad sale on Thursday. Some good States and Canadians made up to 4½d, say 9c, but the current top rate for fair to good bullocks was 9c. No Argentines on offer. The sheep trade was quite active the short supply (900 South Americans and 57 Canadians) enabling sellers to put up the price to 6d (12½c) for picked pens of Argentines, the average of sales as they ran was quite 12c. The Canadian sheep were not a gilt-edged lot, and at 1s 1d (11½c) were well sold. A very much better trade is looked for next week, as the offerings are not likely to be too weighty.",

18970514,historical,torrential,"JUBILEE HELPS PRICES Butchers Take Advantage of It to Mark Up Their Goods - The Leading Market (From our own correspondent Liverpool, May 1) The general course of business in the principal open markets of the country is, on the whole, satisfactory, and for the best descriptions of cattle and sheep prices are well sustained. Lambs are coming forward more plentifully, but their condition is below the average, owing to the bleak weather experienced for some weeks back. As regards imported stock sales this week show a slight falling off in values - Glasgow values perhaps excepted, partly due to the heavy supplies and partly owing to the weather, which, for a couple of days, was very thundery and accompanied by torrential showers. So far as can be estimated the outlook for this season is still favorable to the Canadian exporter, as all the conditions that lead up to good markets are everywhere noticeable. These may again be briefly stated here, although I have already referred to them. To begin with, the war is virtually over, and although this may seem a very remote contingency or disturbing element in connection with our Canadian cattle shipping still, as affecting business generally, it must be taken into account. Then the supplies of native cattle and sheep are very moderate; indeed, in some districts there is a shortage on both, while the quality of native mutton is admittedly below the average. In the industrial centres an unusually active state of affairs is reported, the shipbuilding, engineering, iron and coal industries particularly enjoying the benefit of big orders in hand. These branches cover a wide area of industrial England including, of course, Scotland and Wales. The manufacturing districts in Lancashire, the Midland Counties, with Birmingham, Leicester and Sheffield thrown in, all report trade satisfactory, which is about as much as the phlegmatic Britisher can be brought to admit, even if he is coining money. Arthur Soavn, the diamond jubilee commemoration is expected to bring an extra million of people to the capital, and as they must bring with them at least a tenner, that means a wonderful addition to the turnover of the London shopkeeper. Of course the tenner will not be all spent in meat and drink, but a share of it must go to the hotel, restaurant, or boarding-house keeper, and thus indirectly to the butcher and baker. Already the astute, far-seeing carver of carcasses is putting his prices up on the score of its being jubilee year, you know, and if a customer wants to know why such an event should offer good and sufficient cause for adding a penny per pound to his meat, he is informed with a mysterious air that things are awful dear to buy, especially the extra choice meat as I have to get for such customers as you. Here is a specimen letter from the London Echo: BUTCHERS AND BEEF Sir, The butcher with whom I have been dealing for the past few years has raised all his beef 1d a pound, and gives as his reason for doing so that it is the Jubilee year. I cannot but think it would be a matter of public interest to know if this sort of imposition is to be general in this heavily-burdened and long-suffering metropolis. I am, sir, your obedient servant. Now, if the butcher is going to raise his price, the wholesale man is not above doing the same, and in turn why should not the live stock salesman get another half sovereign for his client, the Canadian exporter, who has in days gone by put many a fiver in the pockets of them all. Thus it goes round. John Bull is to pay more for his bit of meat, and all those interested in shipping it, slaughtering it, selling it, and serving it, have to be helped out of it. And now we infer from all the different items set forth above that the export season should be good, and that from the Manitoba ranches in the lovely Northwest to the sunny-faced butcher in the crowded quarters of Liverpool, Manchester, London and Glasgow, there will be the happiest possible recollections of Her Gracious Majesty's wonderful reign. The picture is so bright and cheerful one can hardly think it possible there is another side to it. And yet there is. I forbear, however, from dwelling on it, simply contenting myself by remarking that freights on United States cattle have jumped up 10s a head already, which would suggest that somebody else was going to have a bit out of the jubilee profit besides the butcher and the cattle exporter and not a little bit either.",

Business has not benefited thereby; quite the contrary. Our country markets have been filling up with cattle and sheep in anticipation of the Christmas demand, while the usual attractive shows and sales of Christmas fat stock have kept many buyers away from Birkenhead, who will, however, probably find their way back after the festive season is over. While the country demand has thus been cut off to a considerable extent, our London customers have been buying pretty strong, the supplies at Deptford for the past ten days having been below the average. The worst of this London trade, however, is they want to buy all our choice beef, and when they get served, there is some difficulty in selling out the secondary and third class bodies left. Still, things keep moving along, and salesmen would not feel comfortable if they had nothing to grumble about.",

Torrential rains are inundating the entrenchments, rendering the work of defence difficult. The numbers of sick among the troops are increasing, making the situation very distressing, and causing increased desertions of the native soldiers. It is estimated that the insurgents number 30,000 armed with rifles, and 100,000 armed with swords, etc. Aguinaldo has summoned me to surrender but I have treated his proposals with disdain, for I am resolved to maintain the sovereignty of Spain and the honor of the king to the last extremity. I have over one thousand sick and 200 wounded. The citadel has been invaded by the suburban inhabitants, who have abandoned their homes owing to the barbarity of the rebels. These inhabitants constitute an embarrassment, aggravating the situation, in view of the bombardment, which, however, is not seriously apprehended for the moment. The Governor of the Visayas and Mindanao Islands cables that he has defeated the insurgents in an engagement during which Chief Arec, Aguinaldo's representative, was killed. He adds that tranquility now prevails throughout these islands, and he further asserts that the principal Malay chiefs of the Mindanao group declare they desire to fight on the side of the Spaniards. Madrid, June 28 Advices from Manila state that Captain-General Augusti's family is still in the hands of the insurgents. General Pena, with a thousand soldiers, has surrendered. His soldiers, most of whom were natives, joined the insurgents. A majority of the detachments in the Island of Luzon have surrendered owing to their lack of food, though some succeeded in escaping. Numerous Spaniards, including the Governors of Uatanga, Laguna and Dulacana, have taken refuge at Cavite. The rebels who are besieging Manila exceed 25,000 men.

Supplies on the open market still continue liberal, owing to prospects of Winter beef being so poor, but this premature disposal will probably now be checked, as in many districts there is quite a marvellous recovery of aftergrowth. A feature of the trade at Deptford has been the complete absence of South American cattle and sheep. This is attributed to the stringent rules and regulations enforced by the Argentine Government which came into operation on 1st August. It is said that shipowners object to the serious liability imposed by these regulations, and have refused point-blank to carry cattle at any price. So far Argentine shippers have not lost much, and as this is the quiet season with them, we presume shipowners and exporters are bluffing the Government a bit, and at the same time seeing what effect it has on markets this side.",

One moment she is all smiles and witchery; the next a demon of malice and hatred. How Calve expresses all this and brings it home to the most careless observer cannot be told in cold print. Her lissome grace of movement, suggestive of the tigeress or the serpent, her wonderful play of feature, from her arch raillery in the first scene to the dumb horror and amazement with which she faces her fate as told by the cards, her last cry as she flees from death all this is beyond description, and it would be worse than useless to attempt it.",

All the principal streets and shops in all quarters of the village were flooded, some merchants losing heavily. All the wharves have been more or less damaged. The pavements in the streets have floated off. The whole village is in a very dilapidated condition. AT MATANE AND TADOUSAC; Matane, November 6 The storm of yesterday was the most severe that has been felt for many years past. The tide rose upwards of two feet over the ordinary November spring tides. Two parts of the Prince Bros. & Co. wharf were carried away and quite a number of deals floated out. Several persons here were obliged to abandon their houses. The damage will be about $3,000. Tadousac, Que, November 6 The wharf at this place and other property have been considerably damaged by yesterday's cyclone. It is stated that there has not been so severe a storm for the past fifty years. The damage cannot be estimated at present. St. Thomas (Montmagny), November 6 The most severe snow and windstorm that has ever visited this town commenced yesterday afternoon and continued during the whole night. Considerable damage was done to the breakwater by the high tides. Ice is forming here very quickly. Car Rocs, Que, November 6 The steamer Champion, with five schooners in tow, bound for Quebec put in here for shelter last night. One of her tows was cast adrift. The market steamers Etoile and St. Louis, with about 200 passengers on board, had also to seek shelter here, a violent hurricane blowing. The tide rose about four feet above the normal spring tide mark, accompanied by a mild cyclone and snowstorm which lashed the waters into a fury. Part of the village was inundated; damage light. Two feet of snow had fallen this morning. Sleighing is excellent and the weather cold. FASSTIVA, LC, November 6 Yesterday afternoon, at a point about three and a half miles east of Bic station, on the Intercolonial railway, the road of the Intercolonial for a distance of about a hundred feet was washed away by the extraordinary high tide. The damage was luckily discovered before the eastbound express reached Bic, and it was stopped at the station. A special train was then brought from Campbellton, with the intention of having the passengers and mails from the express train carted across the dangerous section, it being evident that the track could not be made passable for many hours. Unfortunately, about a mile east of the first was another and far worse washout, the lower part of the road for about three hundred feet having been swept away, but there was nothing on the surface to denote that such was the case. The engines and two cars jolted over the place safely, but the remaining cars of the train careened into the river. A brakeman named Perrin and a telegraph repairer named Lefrere were injured, neither seriously. A gang of men immediately set about building a temporary trestle, while another gang bored the track inward at the western washout. About two this afternoon both places were fit to traverse, and the express train, after its long delay, pursued its way eastward in safety.",
18901203,historical,snowstorm,"I, December 1 A terrible snowstorm visited this province yesterday. The wind blew 40 miles an hour and in many places there are snowdrifts from two to four feet in height. The tide last evening was the highest known here for years and all the wharves were flooded and the lower part of the warehouses thereon. Much damage resulted. Breastworks were carried away and the cellars near the wharf were full of water. Damage by the storm throughout the country is reported as follows: Two railroad bridges wrecked, railroad breastwork damaged and trains delayed; some of the principal shipping ports are closed, and thousands of bushels of potatoes and many vessels will be obliged to remain here all winter. The Island boat started for Pictou and after getting as far as Canso, was obliged to return. She was seventeen hours getting back to port. She had a terrible passage. The thermometer registered 3 degrees below zero. A stable owned by a Mrs. Tremaine, situated in the center of a wooden block, was set on fire during the height of the storm. Two buildings were burned with their contents and two horses also perished. The firebug was not arrested. There is hardly any insurance. The weather has moderated but is still very cold and everything looks wintery. Halifax, December 2 Reports of losses by Scatlcley's storm continue to arrive from various parts of the coast. The schooner Jeffrey Franklin, with a general cargo, was driven ashore on Meagher's beach, at the entrance to Halifax harbor. Her cargo will be saved, but the vessel owned by Murdock McLeod, St. Anns, C.B., is badly damaged; she is insured. A telegram from Whitehead announces the total wreck of the schooner Numbesem, from Sydney for Halifax, with a cargo of coal. The Sunbeam is owned by George Livingstone, of Port L'Isle, C.B., and is insured. At Canso three schooners and eight fishing boats were driven ashore. Three of them are total wrecks and the others are more or less damaged. The vessels ashore are the James Liven, Lida and Lizzie, Hector McKinnon. The Ryan got off with but little damage; the Hector with her top damaged by collision with the Lida and Lizzie. The Lida and Lizzie, laden with dry fish, from D'Escousse for Halifax, is still ashore leaking badly. The Enxine, produce laden, from Prince Edward Island for Halifax, is yet aground and leaking freely. Information has been received at Liverpool by cable from Jamaica announcing the total loss of the schooner On Time, Captain J.K. Kempton, owned by John H. Harlow and others, of that place. She was on her way to Colon to Halifax loaded with old iron. Her crew were saved. The American schooner Alice is ashore at L'Isle aux Coudres. The crew were saved. The following vessels are ashore on the Hunkestury side of the Strait of Canso: Ottawa, Granada, Leila Linwood, Admiration and Helen McCrosby. The Arizona and the brigantines Bessie Louise and Mattie Louise dragged anchors, collided and were damaged. The mails did not cross the straits of Canso today owing to the storm. The schooner Mary Euphrosyne, from Halifax, for Magdalen Islands, with a general cargo is ashore at Port Hawkesbury. The cargo is insured here. Every hour brings fresh reports of wrecks caused by the storm, which seems to have been most destructive on the Cape Breton coast. The schooners Bella May and Kexon are ashore at Gabarus. The Isabella, Captain Ferguson, parted her chains at Arichat and was driven ashore. The Native Lut, Captain McLeod, is ashore at Olawow harbor, Canso, and the Maggie Millard is ashore and full of water at Gabarus. The foregoing are all from Halifax bound to Cape Breton ports. The schooner Virgesco is also reported ashore at Lower Desbarats, C.",

PIKKENS, Miss, March 9 This place has been isolated since last Saturday when the last train passed north. Continued raining in the area Thursday night has raised the water in Big Black River higher than ever known and it is still rising rapidly. The Illinois Central railway track is lifted bodily from its bed and deposited in the ditch for miles below and above here and the embankments swept away. Great damage has been done. A cyclone passed over this place Saturday without doing any damage, dropping over into Madison County, where it caused great destruction of life and property, passing from there into Attala County, near Newport, where houses were blown down and four negroes killed. MADISON, Miss, March 9 The cloudburst Saturday night did immense damage to all railroads entering this city. Knoxville, Tenn, March 9 Very heavy rains prevailed throughout this section yesterday and last night and all streams are out of their banks. A seven-year-old negro child and a negro named Hunter were also drowned yesterday. Chattanooga, Tenn, March 9 The Tennessee River here is rising three inches per hour. Experienced river men predict that it will reach at least 40 feet, which will overflow much of the city in low-lying places, cut off several railroads and for a time suspend the operations of several manufactories. Nashville, Tenn, March 9 The phenomenal rise in the Cumberland River continues. Much damage has been done. Probably between 1,600 and 2,000 people have been driven from their homes and goods in warehouses and elevators have suffered much damage. As viewed from the bridge the river is a vast angry torrent, spreading out over the lowlands. Nearly all of the lumber yards are overflowed. Merchants were busy all day Sunday removing goods from cellars and warehouses near the wharf to higher ground. Heavy Western Snowstorm Chicago, March 9 Despatches from various points throughout Minnesota, Northern Iowa, Central Illinois, Southern Wisconsin and Eastern Nebraska report that the severest snowstorm of the winter raged Saturday night and all day Sunday. There was a regular blizzard blowing and the snow is heavily drifted. Trains are running behind time, especially in Minnesota, and in some localities not a wheel is turning. Attempt at an Old Swindle VICKSBURG, Pa, March 9 The First National Bank of Pittston has received a letter from Spain signed by a priest stating that a vast sum of money is buried somewhere in this vicinity. The letter says that one of the most favored of the courtiers of the late Alfonso was given a large sum of money, said to be a million francs, while the King was on his deathbed in return for the performance of a dying wish. The Queen was jealous of the courtier and at the King's death instructed her ambassador to arrest the courtier for stealing a casket containing a number of jewels from the palace. He fled to America and buried his treasure, but returned to Spain and was arrested and put in prison, where he died. The plans of the place where the treasure was buried were in a satchel which was taken by the tribunal who, not knowing of the contents, offered to dismiss the suit on payment of costs. The priest asks for money to pay the costs and obtain the satchel and plans. A Determined New York Suicide NEW YORK, March 9 John Braum, aged 30, today jumped from the ferryboat James Waterbury, running from Houston Street, this city, to Grand Street, Brooklyn. When the boat had got well out into the stream Braum leaped overboard. Directly he came to the surface the passengers on the boat saw him raise both arms aloft and strike at his head. The Waterbury's engines were stopped, and with boat hooks the deck hands hauled Braum aboard. Strapped to his wrists were two sharp-pointed knives, and with these, while in the water, he had made several severe wounds in his breast, which accounted for the motions that the witnesses to his plunge had seen. The weapons were unstrapped and Braum, after the Brooklyn slip had been reached, was taken to the hospital. The surgeon who attended him said he was not likely to recover. The Fatal Electric Light Wire Albany, March 9 Wires from the Telephone exchange came in contact with the trolley wires of the Broadway Electric Railway tonight and the immediate result was a fire which completely disabled the telephone service and caused a loss of $30,000 to the Hudson River Telephone Company. There was a novel display of pyrotechnics as the telephone wires, unable to carry the current from the trolley wires, became red hot and fell to the ground in pieces. One of the horses of the fire department stepped on a fallen wire and fell dead. An engineer was badly injured. A man was also injured, but quickly recovered. The fire did not burn a great deal, but the valuable switchboard in the telephone office was destroyed, and this caused the loss. Was it a Royalty on Nickel Steel Washington, March 9 Since the United States has commenced to experiment with nickel steel for armor plating a syndicate of European capitalists, including Schneider & Co., of Le Creusot, the French armor makers, has set up a claim for a royalty of two cents a pound on all nickel steel armor made, claiming that its patents cover the process. This claim will be contested by Carnegie, Phipps & Co., of Pittsburgh, who have begun the manufacture of nickel steel, and claim to use processes not covered by the Schneider patents. In the contract with Carnegie, Phipps & Co., by the Navy Department it is stipulated that the Government shall retain the amount claimed as royalty pending the decision of the courts. Returned the Table Dalltim Chicago, March 9 Driven to desperation by abuse the wife of a salesman named Henry Akin attempted to kill her husband yesterday by shooting him in the head. Akin went home drunk and began quarreling. He seized his wife and was choking her, as usual. She had prepared herself for such an incident and jerking a revolver from her pocket fired it in his face. Their three small children screamed with fright and the police running in placed husband and wife under arrest. Akin will recover, but will be noseless and bear a scar four inches long across his cheek. Terrible Indiana Tragedy BATAVIA, Ind, March 9 Yesterday John Dirschure, a well-known hotelkeeper, while drunk and mad with jealousy shot his wife, inflicting a serious wound. Dirschure then placed the revolver at the back of his three-year-old daughter Myrtle and shot her through the heart.

18911214,historical,snowstorm,"A hurricane swept over the camp at Allen Allen hot today and did a great deal of damage. So great was the force of the gale that the gable roof of the barrack was blown down and smashed to pieces. Every building on the grounds was more or less damaged. Fortunately the soldiers now at Allen were attending divine service when the storm broke upon the camp and no one is reported to have been injured. The church in which the service was being held withstood the fury of the gale. A terrific gale prevailed all day in the English Channel. The Cunard Auroral, from New York, which arrived at Liverpool this morning, was unable to stop at Queenstown on account of the gales. The gale, which has been accompanied by snow and heavy rain during Saturday and today, has done much damage throughout the country. Vessels in the English and Irish Channel have been obliged to run for shelter. Vessels arriving at Queenstown report terrible weather on the Atlantic. The steamship Wetherby, from Newport, November 18, which has been towed into Queenstown by the steamship MoGarel, had her shaft bent in a gale of December 4. Four days later the MoGarel commenced towing her, and while the latter was engaged at this work four hawsers were broken, the Wetherby herself was damaged before she arrived at Queenstown. Buildings have been unroofed at the Welsh seaport of Llanelli, and one David Bee was fatally injured by the roof above him falling while he was in bed. Along the Yorkshire coast there has been a severe snowstorm. Suspension of railway service owing to the snow is reported. Floods are reported in many parts of Derbyshire and many streets are under water in Matlock. In the Tees Valley damage amounting to thousands of dollars has been done by the high water, scores of cottages are flooded and a bridge has been partly demolished. There have been several narrow escapes from death. At Cambridge two girls were rushed beneath falling walls. One of them, named Kate Foster, was killed outright, the other injured and in a critical condition. Terrible Ravages, London, December 14. Reports of the ravages of influenza in various parts of Europe are being constantly received. At Perpignan, France, twenty of the twenty-two nuns occupying the convent of St. Claire were prostrated with the disease. When the nuns finally consented to admit outsiders who for several days had vainly sought to offer them assistance, it was found that the poor women were in a starving condition, the only remaining food consisting of a small quantity of dried beans. Proper food and medical attendance were promptly supplied and the sufferers are now rapidly recovering. At Hamburg 2,000 cases of influenza have been reported during the past week and the death toll has not diminished. The famous pianist, Von Bulow, is a victim of the disease and is in a critical condition. Graceful Anglican Church Scene, Dublin, December 13.

18990109,historical,snowstorm,"Snowstorm Revives a Drooping Business TRAINS SLIGHTLY DELAYED Street Car Lines Pound Active for All Their Giant Snow Sweepers, Montreal has been visited with a snowstorm, and fortunately, she has received little or no damage. It started on Friday night, and owing to the slippery state of the sidewalks, pedestrians were compelled for safety's sake to walk in the middle of the road. As the flakes got larger and more profuse, the wind also increased, until at midnight there was a half gale blowing. The velocity of the wind at times was so great that people who wished to turn a corner were compelled to make a herculean effort if they wished to succeed. It made the carters feel happy, and assuredly more courteous. It was predicted that a snowstorm would happen about the New Year, and as each day passed by and no snow arrived, the men were so grievously disappointed that the majority placed their sleighs in the stables and reverted to the wheeled vehicles. A carter told a Gazette reporter last night that the snow had not come a bit too soon, for business during the holidays was so bad that they had not made enough to defray expenses. They, however, reaped a good harvest on Saturday, especially at the close of the theatrical performances, very few sleighs going away without a load. It also made the hearts of the snowshoe men feel glad. As soon as the secretaries of the several clubs discovered that the beautiful snow had come to remain, they at once issued notices to their members to prepare for regular tramps. The members of St. George's Snowshoe Club have extended an invitation to the members of the """"Old Tuque Bleue"""" to join them in a union tramp and entertainment at their clubhouse tomorrow night, and a jolly time is predicted. Among those who do not look with favor upon snowstorms are the Street Railway officials. Although they carry a larger number of passengers, their service is greatly impeded, and the extra expense of running the snowplows and sweepers cuts deeply into the profits. The sweepers are a wonderful invention. Instead of carrying everything before them, they viciously cast everything to the side, with the result that the tracks are clear, but the bank is a great menace to those who drive rigs, and the bumps that one is apt to receive while driving over these innocent banks of snow are not soon forgotten. The importance of these snow sweepers has made many a driver who has the reputation of being a brave man, on seeing a sweeper approaching, suddenly remember that he had a business call on a side street. The sweeper makes it also bad for the passengers. The latter wait patiently for perhaps six minutes for a car at a corner of a street. They signal the motorman to stop, and the latter makes a great effort to oblige, but the rails are so slippery that the car refuses to stop until the wheels have propelled it about fifty yards past the corner. Then there is a frantic run to catch the car, and the half-winded passenger at once begins to abuse the conductor. The conductor, however, being accustomed to such little matters as """"rail down,"""" remains as mute as a sphinx, and pacifies the irritated passenger by calmly asking for his fare. The storm had a delaying effect on some of the incoming trains on Saturday night. At the Windsor station, the Vancouver train, which was due at 6:23, did not arrive until midnight, and the New York train, due at 9:20, was an hour late. At the Grand Trunk depot, the Intercolonial train from Campbellton, due at 10:10, was three hours late, and the Intercolonial from Riviere du Loup, due at 10:20, was an hour late. There were no accidents from the storm reported, and the telegraph officials report that their wires had sustained no damage. B. Taylor, so many of whom preceded him to the undiscovered country. To sum his sterling worth in one brief line, """"And honest truth with well-earned praise combine, The Spartan epitaph reversed must be His country had no worthier son than he."""" Funeral of Mr. Dalglish The funeral of Mr. Robert Dalglish took place on Friday, at 2 p.m., from his late residence, 86 Mackay street, and, notwithstanding the prevalence of a driving snowstorm, was attended by a very large number of the leading men of the city, with whom the deceased had long been on terms of great intimacy, and whose respect, confidence and goodwill he enjoyed in the fullest degree. The body was taken to the Church of St. James the Apostle, where an impressive service was held, Canon Ellegood and the assistant rector officiating. At its conclusion, the cortege reformed and proceeded up Bishop street, where many took sleighs and accompanied the remains to their last resting place at Mount Royal Cemetery. Among those who were present were Thomas Davidson, W. Wainwright, of the Grand Trunk Railway, who called upon Mr. Tarte and informally talked over with him the proposed Toronto-Collingwood line. It is too early yet to discuss definite proposals, but the prospect is that the scheme will rapidly assume practical form. Instead of diverging to Allendale, as is now done, the new road would have to be built as a straight line between Toronto and Collingwood. The idea of the Grand Trunk is that the traffic, upon reaching Toronto, might be divided, a portion being there transferred to vessels for transportation to Montreal, and a portion being taken direct by the main line of railway to that city. No doubt a question of subsidy would have to be considered if the construction of a new line were to be undertaken. The argument which will likely be advanced in support of the application will be that the new line would reserve to Canada a large amount of traffic that would otherwise go by way of the lakes to Buffalo, and that it would therefore be a work that would generally benefit the country. DECEMBER WEATHER Temperature Generally Below the Average During the Month The Dominion Meteorological Service weather chart for December says: The temperature was a little below average in British Columbia and throughout Ontario, except in the extreme eastern portion, where no damage was just maintained; in all the remaining portions of the Dominion it was above average, the excess being particularly marked in the Northwest Territories, and strikingly so in northern Alberta, where Edmonton reports as much as 11 degrees above average. In eastern Canada, Quebec reports the greatest amount above average, namely 3 degrees, and Halifax, Sydney and Charlottetown each give an excess of 2 degrees. The interior portion of the Lower Lake region gives the greatest general amount below average, Brantford and Lucknow each reporting a deficiency of 3 degrees. In the western and southwestern portions of the Lower Lakes region, also from the eastern portion of Lake Superior to about the Ottawa River and embracing the Georgian Bay district in Cape Breton, it was also above average, but seemingly local, whilst in all other portions of Canada it was below average, especially in the province of Quebec and over Vancouver Island. In the former province, there occurred at Quebec a deficiency of 1.5 inches, and at Father Point, 1.8 inches; Victoria in Vancouver Island records 4 inches less than average. In nearly all parts of the Dominion, the precipitation was largely snow, and in Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritime Provinces, some heavy falls occurred. The snowstorm of the 4th and 6th over Ontario was exceptionally heavy. During this storm, Orangeville reports that 28 inches fell, and Collingwood 24 inches. The snowfall during the month in the immediate neighborhood of Owen Sound was phenomenally heavy, the total fall at Owen Sound being reported as 8 feet 5 inches. In Quebec, the weather during December was stormy, and comparatively mild. The temperature was recorded on the 25th at Quebec. A strong northeast gale occurred on the 5th, with a maximum velocity of 62 miles per hour, snow fell nearly every day during the month, yet precipitation is under the average. Snow on the ground at the end of the month was five inches. At Richmond, the snow was from four to five inches in depth on the 31st, and teams have been crossing the river since the 28th.

Train and mail boats have been delayed. In Sheffield the storm is described as a blizzard, and in Manchester the street and railway traffic is badly crippled. A despatch from Brussels says that the Belgian coast was swept by a storm yesterday, and that great damage was done. A despatch from Amsterdam says that the steamer Montenegro went ashore in the storm near Texel Island, in the North Sea. London November 23 The fierce winds, accompanied by a sudden cold snap, have proved serious over the whole northern portion of the kingdom. The snow has caused many blockades and a number of accidents on the railways. Along the coast there have been numerous wrecks, and the lifeboats have been in constant requisition. The Channel traffic is practically suspended, and the hotels at Calais on the French side are crowded with travellers waiting to cross to Dover. NEW YORK New York November 23 There was a disposition manifest to curtail operations on the stock exchange in the early hours of today's session, on account of tomorrow's holiday for one thing, and on account of one or two depressing influences in the market, which offered obstacles to the successful prosecution of the bull campaign. The snowstorm in the West, with its obstruction to traffic and reports of damage to livestock was a discouragement to advancing prices. There was rather less assurance felt also that the Northern Pacific-Oregon Navigation imbroglio was sure to be patched up, and Northern Pacific stocks and others concerned in the quarrel tended downwards. Weakness in a number of the specialties, notably Tobacco, on reports of the character of the opposition in the cigarette branch accentuated the prevailing tendency. People's Gas dropped off at one time 1 1-2, and Federal Steel continued to droop. There was a marked falling off in the recent activity in Atchison preferred, probably the reason for the depressing influences for the other stocks. There was a very marked bull spirit latent in the market, nevertheless, and it turned from the centres of depression and from the region of the snowstorm to other specialties and the eastern railroads. The movement was more marked in the Coalers, and had its inception in the Reading issues. The buying of these securities was attributed to the banking interest, which yesterday advanced Southern preferred and which is dominant in Northern Pacific and has important interests in Federal Steel. How far yesterday's manipulation of Southern preferred and today's of the trading securities is designed to sustain the weak spots elsewhere in the common interest of the manipulator can only be a matter of surmise. Louisville, New York Central, Ontario & Western and a number of other eastern railways enjoyed their period of strength and aided towards the late recovery and the firm close at a level generally above yesterday's prices. Andrew McKinney & Co, members of the New York Stock Exchange, wire J E Fairchild, manager, U St, Sacramento street: The stock market was active, but irregular today, with prices towards an improvement. The delay in the reply of the Spanish peace commission was construed as favorable to an amicable settlement and a sharp advance took place. Manhattan rose about 2 percent, on rumors that a large short interest in the stock was forced to cover, and near the approach toward a change in the motive power. In the Industrials there was very little of interest. The market has been very dull all day, with the usual closing up of contracts before a holiday, but without any pressure of long stocks as the feeling is very confident of an early and satisfactory settlement of our affairs with Spain. All conditions point to a better market and an advance in prices all along the list. Money easy, 2 percent.",

About 9 o'clock the steamer Pilot was at Barras wharf, Levis, when suddenly an enormous mass of ice caught it and pinned it to the wharf, causing considerable damage. It was torn from its fastenings and was being drifted away. It needed all the ability of the captain and crew to prevent a serious accident. Fortunately the steamer got safely up the river to its own wharf. It is said that a deputation from the Quebec Board of Trade will proceed to Ottawa in a few days to wait on the Premier and his colleagues on the ocean mail subsidy question. The deputation will be very strong and representative of the leading interests of the place. The people of the town of Chicoutimi and of Hebertville are organizing a great excursion to Quebec, via the Lake St. John railway, on the occasion of the opening of the Provincial Legislature. A number of merchants from Chicoutimi have been in town since the beginning of the winter, all coming by rail, although the distance from Chicoutimi to Lake St. John is so considerable. Goods to and from Chicoutimi are also sent by this route. There is a rumor on the street, which is given for what it is worth, to the effect that a swap is on the tapis by which Hon. Mr. Shebryn and Mr. Francois Langelier will change positions, Mr. Shebryn going to Ottawa to sit in the Commons, and Mr. Langelier assuming for the time being, during Mr. Mercier's illness, the post of Acting Premier of the province.

NEW GRAIN STANDARDS For Manitoba Wheat Strongly Denounced by the Toronto Board of Trade Toronto, December 28 The grain and flour sections of the Board of Trade met this afternoon to consider the order-in-council changing the present standard of grain for Manitoba and the Northwest. After a warm discussion the following resolution was passed by the grain section and ordered to be telegraphed to Mr. Hull, Inland Revenue department, Ottawa: """"That, whereas an order-in-council has been passed changing the grades of Manitoba wheat, which will disarrange and cause endless trouble in carrying out contracts already entered into for future delivery on the basis of present grades, as well as necessitating the withdrawal of all samples now in the hands of foreign buyers and the furnishing of new standards, thereby causing great delay and cessation of business operations; therefore, be it resolved, that this board desires to express its strong feeling of disapprobation at the changing of grain standards by the governor-in-council without consulting the commercial interests of the country through their various channels; and would, therefore, move that the council of this Board of Trade take such action in the matter as they may deem best to obtain, if possible, the remanding of the order-in-council until such time as all interested are consulted and their views ascertained."""" The flour section passed the following resolutions: Resolved, """"That whereas an order-in-council has been passed amending the standard of Manitoba wheat, and which is fraught with most pressing import to all millers and flour dealers, any change at this time when the grades are fixed, approved and known, is undesirable and likely to obstruct business and also involve in litigation all contracts of sale fixed and still executed. Resolved that this section deprecates the fact that any change in existing standards of grain is not possible, not coming through the regular constituted board of grain examiners, who should be, in our opinion, the only authority possible.""""

Much damage was done here. Many persons were injured. The glass roof of the Westminster Aquarium was demolished, causing a panic among the audience, in which several persons were hurt. A printing office in the Haymarket was unroofed and a boy killed. Many vessels were wrecked off the coast, and a large number of lives lost. Reports from all parts of the kingdom agree that the gale was one of almost unparalleled severity. At Hastings the seas dashed over the streets, making walking dangerous. At Monmouth, the Wye and Monnow Rivers overflowed and the highways were flooded, and Southampton and Eastbourne suffered severely. At Torquay there were many casualties. Trees were uprooted and many boats swamped. Shops on the Isle of Wight closed early on Saturday owing to the hurricane. At Newry many houses were unroofed. At Leeds the roof of a dwelling collapsed, killing the daughter of a workman. The mail train between Durham and Darlington was twice stopped by the gale. The large Nokomis, Capt. Murphy, which sailed for Londonderry on January 10th for Baltimore, and which returned to Lough Foyle for shelter, parted her cables and was driven out to sea. It is feared the vessel and all hands have been lost. The iron chapel at Newcastle was demolished, and the roof falling killed a woman and two children. A heavy snowstorm raged in many places. There have been numerous marine casualties around the coast, the trisia reports having had a rough passage, with heavy gales and tremendous sea. The railway station at Elmswell was blown across the rails, blocking traffic for some time. London, January 24 seven bodies have been washed ashore at Hythe.

18871229,historical,snowstorm,"THE ANCIENT CAPITAL A Political Shuffle Talked of A Furious Snowstorm Does Much Damage A Big Mearilus Planned (From our own correspondent) Quebec, December 28 A furious snowstorm from the east set in this morning and still continues, raging with great violence. About 9 o'clock the steamer Pilot was at Barras wharf, Levis, when suddenly an enormous mass of ice caught it and pinned it to the wharf, causing considerable damage. It was torn from its fastenings and was being drifted away. It needed all the ability of the captain and crew to prevent a serious accident. Fortunately the steamer got safely up the river to its own wharf. It is said that a deputation from the Quebec Board of Trade will proceed to Ottawa in a few days to wait on the Premier and his colleagues on the ocean mail subsidy question. The deputation will be very strong and representative of the leading interests of the place. The people of the town of Chicoutimi and of Hebertville are organizing a great excursion to Quebec, via the Lake St. John railway, on the occasion of the opening of the Provincial Legislature. A number of merchants from Chicoutimi have been in town since the beginning of the winter, all coming by rail, although the distance from Chicoutimi to Lake St. John is so considerable. Goods to and from Chicoutimi are also sent by this route. There is a rumor on the street, which is given for what it is worth, to the effect that a swap is on the tapis by which Hon. Mr. Shebryn and Mr. Francois Langelier will change positions, Mr. Shebryn going to Ottawa to sit in the Commons, and Mr. Langelier assuming for the time being, during Mr. Mercier's illness, the post of Acting Premier of the province. Messrs. Shebryn and Langelier each represent Quebec constituencies so strongly Liberal in their tendencies that there would be no risk in making the proposed arrangement. NEW GRAIN STANDARDS For Manitoba Wheat Strongly Denounced by the Toronto Board of Trade Toronto, December 28 The grain and flour sections of the Board of Trade met this afternoon to consider the order-in-council changing the present standard of grain for Manitoba and the Northwest. After a warm discussion the following resolution was passed by the grain section and ordered to be telegraphed to Mr. Hull, Inland Revenue department, Ottawa: """"That, whereas an order-in-council has been passed changing the grades of Manitoba wheat, which will disarrange and cause endless trouble in carrying out contracts already entered into for future delivery on the basis of present grades, as well as necessitating the withdrawal of all samples now in the hands of foreign buyers and the furnishing of new standards, thereby causing great delay and cessation of business operations; therefore, be it resolved, that this board desires to express its strong feeling of disapprobation at the changing of grain standards by the governor-in-council without consulting the commercial interests of the country through their various channels; and would, therefore, move that the council of this Board of Trade take such action in the matter as they may deem best to obtain, if possible, the remanding of the order-in-council until such time as all interested are consulted and their views ascertained."""" The flour section passed the following resolutions: Resolved, """"That whereas an order-in-council has been passed amending the standard of Manitoba wheat, and which is fraught with most pressing import to all millers and flour dealers, any change at this time when the grades are fixed, approved and known, is undesirable and likely to obstruct business and also involve in litigation all contracts of sale fixed and still executed. Resolved that this section deprecates the fact that any change in existing standards of grain is not possible, not coming through the regular constituted board of grain examiners, who should be, in our opinion, the only authority possible.""""

18840303,historical,snowstorm,"THE EHOWSTOBX, The delay to the train service stranded bound passengers. The snowstorm which began on Thursday evening and which did not abate until Saturday was one of the severest that has been witnessed in this part of the country for many a year. The train on the Canadian Pacific Railway which left Montreal at seven o'clock on Friday morning managed to reach Ottawa at half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, being three hours behind time, but strange to say the fast express which left the city at 8:45 the same morning did not get any further than St Martin's Junction and the passengers were obliged to return to Montreal on Saturday night. The departure of the fast express from Ottawa on Friday afternoon was delayed for an hour, and at 1:20 a start was made, two engines being attached to the train, and a snow plough having been sent on ahead to clear the track. Before the latter reached Buckingham, however, some twenty miles from Ottawa, it had been so badly damaged that it was useless to send it any further. With the train everything went well until L'Ange Gardien was reached, being then a quarter of an hour behind the regular time limit. Here several of the passengers, fearing that the train would not be able to reach Montreal that night, as the train which left Montreal in the morning had not yet been heard of, alighted and stopped overnight. The train then proceeded on its way but got stuck in a snowdrift within a mile of St Augustine. The shovellers were at once set to work, and after a delay of three hours and a half, the train got through and proceeded until St. Andrew was reached. Here another delay occurred, which was accentuated by the fact that the snow-plough which had been left at Buckingham was observed struggling in the snow-drift through which the train had just safely passed, and it was thought that it would be better to let the plough go ahead of the train. After waiting for over two hours, however, it was evident that the plough was not equal to the task, and the train actually got under way but had only seen a couple of miles when a most annoying snowdrift was encountered, it being then about two o'clock Saturday morning. The drift at this point, which was heavily packed, was five or six feet deep and extended for over a mile, so there was no help for it but to camp there overnight. In the morning, the conductor, Mr. Dwyer, drove to St. Therese, a distance of about five miles, where he secured an additional gang of men, who at once went to work and shortly before twelve o'clock they had sufficiently cleared the track to permit the train to proceed. On reaching St. Therese, however, still another drift was met with, which took the shovellers about four hours to get rid of, when the train again proceeded on its way and reached St. Martin Junction about six o'clock, after having experienced several short delays on account of minor drifts. At St. Martin the passengers on the train which left Montreal at 8:45 the previous morning were taken on board and the train again got under way. Before coming to the bridge across the Back River at Sault aux Recollets, another drift was encountered, occasioning a delay of about an hour, and the train came in contact with another very heavy snow drift within about two miles of the Mile End Depot, which occasioned a delay of about four hours. At this point several of the passengers discussed the advisability of attempting to walk to the city, but all finally decided to remain on board. About eleven o'clock the shovellers had cleared the track and the train again proceeded, reaching the Dalhousie Square Depot about 11:30 on Saturday night, having taken thirty hours to make the journey. Much credit is due to the conductor, the engineers, and the other officials of the train for the manner in which they acquitted themselves under the circumstances, the opinion of all being that it was one of the worst storms they ever had experienced. Many of the shovellers were completely exhausted; in fact, some of them were so fatigued that they were unable to work when the last snow-drift was reached. The snow in several places blew into the railway cut almost as fast as it was shovelled out. ON THE CANADA ATLANTIC, matters were not much better. The trains which left the city on Friday did not reach Ottawa until early Saturday morning. The early train from Ottawa on Saturday was cancelled or rather its departure was delayed until eleven o'clock, when the conductor expressed a belief that he would make the usual time to Montreal. Everything went well as far as Glen Robertson, the track being clear and the regular time limit being observed. At that point it was ascertained that the train which left Montreal in the morning was stuck a short distance west of St. Polycarpe. The train going east got orders to meet it, and, if possible, help it through. About halfway between Glen Robertson and St. Polycarpe a serious snow drift was encountered, the snow being heavily packed. The shovellers went to work, and after a delay of about an hour and a half the train got through and proceeded until it reached within about a mile of St. Polycarpe. At that point the locomotive of the train which had left Montreal in the morning was found frozen stiff in the drift, which it had attempted to break through, and to do which it had left the passenger cars at the station at St. Polycarpe. The drift at this point was six or even seven feet deep and packed very heavily. The shovellers had been at work and had so far cleared the track that the locomotive of the eastern bound train was able to get up to the other, but that was found to be so firmly frozen that it took fully two hours to move it, several ropes being snapped in the operation, and at one time the prospect being that nothing could be done until greater locomotive power was obtained from Montreal. By dint of perseverance, however, the track was at last cleared, and each train was enabled to proceed on its way, that for Montreal reaching the city about 8 o'clock, having taken nine hours to make the journey. All the testimony of the railway hands is to the effect that no such storm has been experienced for years. Another train was despatched from Ottawa at 9 o'clock yesterday morning, arriving here at two in the afternoon, so that the road is now clear, and the regular trains will be run today.",
18940213,historical,snowstorm,"St. Catharines, February 12 A terrific wind and snowstorm has prevailed here most of the day and is still raging. The electric street railway car line is knocked out and traffic generally demoralized. London, London, Ont, February 12 The storm today was the severest that has visited this city this winter and was made up of wind, sleet and snow; it completely paralyzed business. The wind reached its greatest velocity about noon and prevailed with undiminished strength for the remainder of the day. Comparatively little snow fell, but what there was was blown into drifts about the sidewalks and pavements. On the eastbound railroads trains were running a little behind time owing to the storm. Niagara Falls, Niagara Falls, Ont, February 12 The worst snowstorm of years struck town this morning. A regular northeast gale blew the snow in all directions. Towards evening the gale reached a terrific force, piling the snow up in piles eight to ten feet deep, completely suspending traffic on the streets. The horse cars to Drummondville shut down for the night early in the afternoon. The electric lines on both sides of the river, after fighting the storm, gave up in despair. The railways are having their hands full trying to keep their lines open for passenger traffic only; passenger trains on all the lines are running from three to five hours late, freight traffic being abandoned. Hamilton, Hamilton, February 12 A genuine blizzard struck here today. A snowstorm, accompanied by a very strong northeast wind, has been raging nearly all day. The electric service is entirely suspended and street traffic generally is much impeded. Trains east and west are pretty well on time and from the north and south the service has been kept up fairly well so far. Windsor, Windsor, Ont, February 12 The Windsor, Sandwich and Walkerville street railway lines were tied up by the storm about 10:30 this morning, and the cars stand in the street where they were deserted by their crews. Traffic and business of all kinds is almost entirely suspended. The ferry boats are almost deserted and it is almost impossible to make a landing on the other side. The water in Detroit River is rapidly backing from the lakes below and has risen nearly three feet since yesterday, the current being at a perfect standstill. It is almost an impossibility to run the car ferries, and trains on all roads entering Windsor are several hours behind time. THE AMERICAN END It began in Kansas and ended in the Atlantic. Chicago, February 12 The worst blizzard that ever struck this city, so far as the weather bureau records show for twenty-three years, is raging here. Street traffic is greatly impeded and walking is accompanied with great danger to life and limb. Many persons have already been injured by being blown to the ground, against walls and street posts by the wind. The velocity is eighty miles an hour, the highest ever recorded for this city and almost double the velocity of the wind which is blowing a blizzard in the Western states. The wind was so furious at the corners where skyscrapers are built, especially the Monadnock annex block, bounded by Jackson, Van Buren and Dearborn streets and Custom House place, that extra policemen gave all their attention to the pedestrians. Dozens of women were lifted off their feet and blown to the ground, or else pushed across the streets until they came in violent contact with walls, posts and other obstacles. Mrs. Brahany, of No. 361 South Clinton street, a charwoman at the Art Institute, was lifted in the air and dashed against the fireplug of the Dearborn and Van Buren street corner. Two of her ribs were broken, and it is believed she is internally injured. She lay in the snow drift until men rushed to her rescue, and the police ambulance took her home. The gusts of wind and blinding particles of snow frightened men as well as women from attempting to cross Dearborn street at Van Buren. The feet of others kept them within sheltering doorways. Civilians and policemen became a volunteer brigade, and on the principle that in union there is strength, they locked arms with the belated police workers and crossed in safety. At the stockyards there was a practical suspension of business all the morning. No buyers were to be seen. Stock trains were late, and when they did arrive were covered with snow. In the suburbs the storm was felt with rather more severity than in the heart of the city. One of the big front windows of the Leland hotel was blown in early this morning at the very beginning of the storm. The glass was blown clear across one of the parlors by the force of the wind, but the window was boarded up before any serious damage was done by the snow. The drifted snow and the high wind played havoc with the mail. Nearly all the mail trains were late, and from some of them no tidings were received until late in the day. All the roads suffered, both the eastern and western trains being from one to eight hours late. The driving snow made signals on the railroad tracks practically useless, and caused a collision between two freight trains on the West Shore tracks near 97th street and Stoney avenue about noon. Luther J. Webster, fireman on the second train, had his foot crushed. More accidents were reported to the police today resulting from the high wind. In spite of the fearful weather and the condition of the streets the ambulances were kept busy a large part of the day. Bloomington, Ill, February 12 A violent snowstorm raged throughout central Illinois all today. The snow is ten inches on a level, and is badly drifted. Many trains are delayed, and one passenger train on the Big Four is stuck in a drift near Tremont. There are drifts here five feet deep. Indiana, Fort Wayne, February 12 The great blizzard reached this city at four o'clock this morning and is still raging. All streetcar traffic was abandoned at an early hour. Every railroad centering here is blocked and traffic is practically suspended on all lines. Wabash, February 12 The heaviest snowstorm of the season raged here yesterday and today. The wind blew sixty miles an hour. The thermometer was below zero and the suffering among the poorly clad and half-housed people on the big prairie north of here is fearful. New York, Sabana Lake, Y, February 12 The worst storm of the season is now raging here. The thermometer has dropped 42 degrees in four hours and now registers eight below zero. Snow is falling and aided by a terrific west wind is drifting badly. New York, February 12 The city tonight is covered with a mantle of snow several inches thick. Travel of all kinds is greatly impeded. The storm is the most severe one of the season and is expected to last until tomorrow night or Wednesday morning. The thermometer is down to 20 degrees, and the wind is blowing from the northeast at the rate of thirty miles an hour. Railroad traffic is almost demoralized. All trains are behind time, and the mails from the south and west are greatly delayed. The ferry houses are blocked with belated passengers waiting for the overdue ferry boats, which are compelled to run at a considerably reduced rate of speed. The elevated railroad trains are delayed. The effect of the snow is felt on the outskirts of the city, and the markets are stagnated by the lack of farm produce, the roads being almost impassable on account of deep snow drifts. Sergeant Dunn, of the weather bureau, said tonight that this storm was but the advance guard of one more severe, which would be followed by a very cold wave. Danger signals have been ordered up all along the coast and vessels have been warned not to leave port. At the rate the snow is falling tonight it will be a foot deep by the morning. Reports from all points throughout the state indicate that the storm is general and very severe and that traffic is greatly impeded; trains are badly delayed everywhere. Dispatches from New Jersey report a similar state of affairs. The storm along the New Jersey and Long Island coast is particularly severe. A high northeast gale prevails, and the air is thick with flying snow. Mariners off the coast will have a hard night of it. It is probable that several wrecks will be reported tomorrow. The life-saving crews have doubled their patrols and are on the alert so as to promptly answer signals of distress. One wreck was reported tonight. It occurred on Rockaway Beach, opposite the Arverne hotel. The Arverne life-saving crew cannot go to the relief of the vessel on account of the blinding snowstorm and the high and heavy sea which prevails. The vessel is stranded some distance off shore, and her size or the crew she carries cannot be ascertained. The fate of the crew is in doubt, but their position is an extremely dangerous one. Nebraska, Omaha, Neb, February 12 Nebraska is snowbound. For the past twenty-four hours a terrific blizzard has prevailed throughout the state. The fall has been about twelve inches and, following the eight-inch fall of snow on Thursday, makes the depth at least twenty inches. The cold is extremely severe with few exceptions. Omaha traffic of every description is suspended. Trains in every direction last night were abandoned. The mail trains are being got through with difficulty. The high wind has been piling the snow in great drifts. Reports from the interior show stock is in good condition and farmers are pleased with the immense snowfalls, as it assures a fine winter wheat crop. Ohio, Cleveland, February 12 A severe wind and snowstorm from the northwest struck this city this morning. Nearly all trains are late. Streetcar traffic is almost entirely suspended. Fhf, mont, O, February 12 In a blinding snowstorm, which had been raging all morning, freight train No. 40, westbound, and eastbound light freight No. 25, on the Wheeling and Lake Erie railroad, collided two miles west of Bellevue about 10:30 o'clock. Both engines and several freight cars were smashed and piled up in confusion. Engineer Connell, of light freight No. 25; Fireman McMullen, of engine No. 25; Brakeman Johnson, of freight engine No. 28; and Engineer Samuel Stowell, of engine No. 28, were killed. Missouri, St. Louis, Mo, February 12 Without warning from the weather bureau a veritable Kansas blizzard struck this city at 11 o'clock last night and continued up to 6 o'clock tonight. Rain, hail, sleet and snow alternately swept over the city before a high wind. At daylight the street railways had abandoned efforts to run cars till the tracks were cleared by snow plows. All the railway trains that were not abandoned entirely were late, the Alton express from Chicago being eight hours behind time. The snow is four inches deep, which is phenomenal for this latitude, as time passed the storm increased in severity and at 2 p.m. the wind had risen to a 30-mile gait, with the thermometer 8 degrees above zero and falling. The casualties are numerous, but none serious. The overhead wires look like masses of white ropes and many have been snapped by the weight of ice. Two horses were shocked to death by coming in contact with a broken live wire. Telegrams from all points from the South and West show that the storm is widespread and disastrous. Mississippi, New Orleans, February 12 Advices received here today and tonight indicate that a storm approaching in violence a cyclone is raging in Mississippi, and that the town of Newton has been wiped out of existence, but as the telegraph wires are all down full particulars cannot be obtained. Memphis, Tenn, February 12 A special from Jackson, Miss, says: A terrible cyclone passed between Martinsville and Beauregard, 40 miles south of here, at a late hour at night within a few miles of a patch of the terrible cyclone of April, 1884. The cyclone was about a mile wide and everything in its path was leveled. A great many houses were swept from their foundations, trees twisted off, fences destroyed, several people killed and a great many seriously injured. Kansas, Kansas City, February 12 The worst snowstorm in years raged all over Kansas and Missouri last night and today, for not a single train was on time. The snow averaged from one foot to two feet on the level. High winds accompanied it, and at some points it is 20 feet deep. In many sections schools were closed today. In towns with street railways the service was paralyzed. The snow was dry and the telegraph service was not injured. Topeka, Kan, February 12 All railroads in Kansas are blockaded with snow and scarcely a wheel is turning in the state. Vessels Ashore, Long Branch.",

The storm also extended to the cities of Wilkes-Barre and Carbondale. A Holiday For Telegraph Operators, Kittatinny, NJ, January 20 The storm here has been the most disastrous in years. The telegraph service has never experienced such interruptions. All communication was badly interrupted. The Western Union office is entirely closed to customers and employees have a holiday. Patterson, NJ, January 20 This city yesterday found itself back in the late twenties in some respects. The heavy weight of wet snow on the hundreds of overhead wires that stretched over the principal streets pulled down scores of poles all over the town. Of the seven interurban lines in the city only two run any cars. The rest are hopelessly blocked by fallen poles and wires. New York, January 20 No traces of the snowstorm of Saturday night and yesterday morning, which played such havoc with wires, remained in the air at least today.

The schools suffered severely, and the few scholars that turned out were sent home at the noon hour. Over sixteen inches of snow fell during the day and it was of that wet kind which stuck wherever it touched. All attempts to clear the sidewalks were abandoned towards nightfall as useless. Tonight it is colder with a high wind. The street railway did not have a car out, and the Bay of Fundy and Boston steamers did not leave their moorings.

To-night a furious gale is blowing in St. John and throughout this section of New Brunswick with the mercury down below zero. The snow is drifting into large piles and is filling up railway cuttings faster than the ploughs can be operated against it. A train which left Fredericton yesterday morning only reached here to-night, and between Fredericton and Woodstock several passenger trains are stalled by the snow. Reports from many parts of the province state that this last snowfall has practically put an end to operations in the lumber woods, the snow being too deep for hauling. There is much suffering in many districts, through the highways being impassable for teams, the food supply for both animals and man being very short. Despatches from St. Stephen to-night state that the Canadian Pacific railway branch to that town is totally blockaded and like reports have come in from St. Andrew's.

18981128,historical,flood,"LEGAL INTELLIGENCE SUPERIOR COURT JUDGMENTS THE GRADING OF CITY HALL AVENUE JUDGMENT AGAINST THE CITY Montreal, November 26 By Mr. Justice Archibald C. 8 Helnhardt vs The City of Montreal Montreal - The action concerns damages 1 II iltntlH MY City Hall and Fortier streets, Mr. Justice Archibald, in renue 'ThVltTrbrewer' and occupied on what was formerly called German street, just at the foot leading to Sherbrooke street. The name of this street is now City Hall street. This street was not graded previous to 1893 beyond Ontario street but ran from the latter street towards Sherbrooke street, nearly on a level and ended against the steep face of the bluff forming the Sherbrooke street plateau. Wooden stairs for foot passengers were placed to enable them to communicate with Sherbrooke street. The plaintiff's brewery was constructed upon this hill face. In 1893 the defendant graded the street, so as to make it practicable for traffic up to Sherbrooke street, and in so doing raised the level of the street, abutting plaintiff's brewery from 2 to 8 feet above its old level. Plaintiff's property extended up the hill and was bounded by a street named Fortier street, running at right angles with City Hall street, practically on a level with Sherbrooke street. The grading of City Hall street necessitated the filling up at the foot of the hill, and an excavation, when the hill was reached. This excavation was of considerable depth when it crossed Fortier street, and necessitated a cut also in Fortier street in both directions. Previous to this work being done very little water from the Sherbrooke street level came down City Hall street. It was carried westward on Fortier street and discharged into the St. Lawrence street drains. The cut made in Fortier street changed the grade, and brought large quantities of water down City Hall street. Plaintiff had a drain in City Hall street which he made himself, and which was sufficient for his needs. The defendant opened gullies into this drain, and it proved to be quite insufficient in anything like a heavy rain to carry away the water, which, in consequence, backed up and flooded the plaintiff's cellar. In addition to this, much of the water could not find an entrance into the drain, and it was thrown against the plaintiff's walls and injured them very materially. Before the works mentioned, plaintiff had a good frontage on Fortier street for his vacant land on the top of the hill, but by the lowering of Fortier street this land was left at an elevation, and would require to be carried away to enable plaintiff to utilize his land. One side of plaintiff's building abuts land belonging to the defendant, upon which it has erected a police and fire station, and used plaintiff's wall without paying for it. Plaintiff's claims for damages are as follows: Cost of reducing the level of Fortier street so as to make it conform with the new level of that street $2,000. Depreciation of value of the brewery buildings, by raising the grade in front of them $6,000. Damages suffered to the brewery by reason of the inconvenience and extra cost of handling the products, owing to the change of grade $1,000. Damages resulting from the flooding $2,000. Damages resulting from defendant's action concerning plaintiff's wall $1,000. Forming a total of $12,500. The defendants at first pleaded a general denial, but afterwards were allowed to plead a supplementary plea, of which the following are the material propositions: 1. If plaintiff has suffered any damage, it is compensated by advantages gained by plaintiff, by the works in question. 2. That plaintiff had himself solicited that the works should be done, and had given his full consent thereto. The first of these propositions had been, in my judgment, entirely rebutted by the proof. The street opened is so steep that although a horse with an empty wagon can go up, it would be quite impracticable to go up with a load. It is not quite clear whether the work benefits anyone, but it is certain that plaintiff reaps no advantage from it. As to the second proposition of the supplementary defence, it is only proved to the extent that the plaintiff knew of the works and did not put any obstacle in their way. The defendant did not need the plaintiff's consent for these works and had the right to disregard any opposition which plaintiff might make. There is nothing proved on this head which forms any answer to plaintiff's action. Plaintiff has proved that when his brewery was built his architect got a level from the defendant and built conformably to it. If then he has suffered damage by the change of that level he has a right to indemnity. Taking first his first claim of $2,000 for reducing the level of his vacant property, it must be remarked that plaintiff, building as he did against the face of the hill on a level which would preclude any idea of the subsequent opening and use of City Hall street, cannot base his claim on this head upon the cost of reducing the level of that of City Hall street. Before, however, the works were made he had a frontage on the level of Fortier street, and he has the right to an amount sufficient to put himself in the same position with respect to Fortier street as he was in before. Plaintiff's witnesses, as well as some of defendant's, consider 80 cents per cubic yard as a low price for the removal of that earth. Although one witness of defendant declares the work could be done for 50 cents, I think he was relying on the likelihood of finding a near place where the earth could be dumped. I am disposed to grant the plaintiff 75 cents per cubic yard, making for the 357 cubic yards necessary to remove to reduce the land to the Fortier street level the sum of $267.45. The second item of plaintiff's demand, $1,500, includes damage done to plaintiff's property by water, and work necessary to prevent the continuation of that damage and also depreciation of the value of the property by being buried to a certain extent in the ground. The proof with regard to the damage by water is uncontradicted, and is moreover founded upon precise specifications of details. It is proved that the plaintiff's drain was quite sufficient before the change to carry away all the water; that the effect of the change was to increase enormously the quantity of water coming down the street; that the city, without right, made gullies admitting this water into plaintiff's drain; that transversely the grade of City Hall street opposite plaintiff's brewery showed a fall of 18 inches from the opposite side of the street to plaintiff's wall, thus throwing the water against the wall; that the mortar of the wall was completely disintegrated by the action of the water and that it would be necessary to excavate all along the outer face and put a coating of cement as well as point with cement the inner face; that the cellars had been frequently flooded and the brick and cement floor destroyed by the action of water; that the raising of the level of the street had immersed the stone foundation and part of the brick work in the ground, and it would be necessary to raise the stone work of the foundation so that it should come above the surface. The cost of these works is proved as follows: Sixty lineal feet of new string course $1,500. Repairs to brick work (say 2,500 bricks) $1,000. Works necessary to repair the foundation wall $30,507.50. In addition to this plaintiff claimed $2,060 for a puddle wall to be constructed outside the foundations to prevent the water from continuing to damage the wall. This item, I refuse because the puddle wall would not be necessary if the defendant constructs properly, and if it does not do so it will be liable further in the future. With regard to diminution in value of the property, I found the proof insufficient and I appoint experts to report on that point. They report unanimously that the property has been diminished in value by the raising of the level of the river two feet to seven feet, along a line of 60 feet, whereby the appearance of the building is materially affected, and they assess damage at $2,507.50. Amount above detailed Total under this head $3,057.50. The next item claimed by plaintiff for damages as a brewery by the increased difficulty and expense of handling the product amounts to $2,000. The proof establishes that the loading of the mash became very difficult by reason of the change of grade, and also that the grade was so steep at the place where this product was loaded that buyers refused to come, and a considerable portion thereof could not be sold and had to be thrown away; also that the beer, which before the change of level was simply rolled into the express wagons, had now to be lifted, causing a considerable extra expense. The plaintiff's proof indicates that the extra costs under this head would amount to between $200 and $400 per annum. If this be the case, and the defendant has led no evidence to contradict it or to show that remedy could be applied to avoid or diminish such extra cost, I cannot think that the sum demanded by the plaintiff is excessive. I therefore grant the plaintiff the sum of $1,000. The next item, namely, for damages from flooding, for which the plaintiff claims $2,500, must be understood to refer to the costs of cleaning after the various floodings, as the other damages by water have been already taken up. I am disposed to think that this item has not been satisfactorily proved, beyond the sum of $100, for which plaintiff must have judgment. There remains the item of $1,000 claimed by plaintiff for half the value of the mitoyen wall used by defendant. The proof offered by plaintiff brings this item up to $195.50. The defendant has offered proof on this point, which reduces this item to $116.97. I am disposed to adopt this latter figure. There is another item which I think it is reasonable to award to plaintiff. The circumstances of the case were such as to require an examination by experts before bringing the action. This plaintiff did and the value of these services is proved in the case as follows: $365.00. And then, that plaintiff is entitled to judgment as follows: 1. Earth removal $267.45. 2. Damages to building by water $2,507.50. 3. Damage to building by diminution of value by being sunk in the ground as reported by experts $550.00. 4. Damage by inconvenience in handling products $1,000.00. 5. Costs of cleaning after flooding $100.00. 6. Half cost mitoyen wall $116.97. 7. Costs of examination and plans by experts $365.00. Total, with interest and costs of $4,906.92 from date of judgment. By Mr. Justice Curran The Prairie Pressed Brick Company v Margaret Pillard et al - Judgment for the defendant, beger, for $4,500.

18860423,historical,flood,"L J NOTES OF THE SESSION, Government Inquiry Into the floods Proposed, THE NORTHWEST REPRESENTATION Mr Job introduced the Remuneration Bill and Resolution Opposition sometimes in Supply-Payments to the High Commissioner, OTTAWA, April 22, Pursuant to arrangement the House adjourned at 6 o'clock to-day, to allow members to leave by the evening trains for their homes for the Easter holidays. The attendance was small, many of the members having anticipated the adjournment by going away earlier in the day. The only discussion of interest took place on the Government bill and resolution to give representation in Parliament to the Northwest Territories. Sir John A. Macdonald, who was in his place for a short time, introduced the bill and explained that it was proposed to give two seats to Assiniboia, and one each to Alberta and Saskatchewan, the other, the Territory of Athabasca, not being sufficiently populated as yet to entitle it to representation. The resolution, which was also moved by Sir John, was for an address to the Imperial authorities to empower the Parliament of the Dominion to give such representation, there being no provision in the existing Imperial act whereby this can be done in the case of territories. The resolution was reported and concurred in with little debate. THE OPPOSITION OBSTRUCTION, The remainder of the sitting was spent in supply and on the single item of contingencies, which even was not passed. Mr Blake was absent, but his followers wasted hours objecting to petty laundry bills and gratuities to telegraph messengers, in violation of the distinct agreement on which the adjournment was arranged that there should be some progress in supply. Sir Hector Langevin reminded the Opposition of this arrangement, but it was all to no purpose and the house adjourned without a single item having been passed in supply. PAYMENTS TO THE HIGH COMMISSIONER, The Toronto Globe of March 2 makes the following estimate of the payments to the High Commissioner during the year: Salary, $10,000; contingencies, $1,611; travelling expenses (immigration), $250; travelling expenses (Antwerp examination), $487, a total of $14,348. To arrive at the sum received by the High Commissioner for salary and contingencies, according to the Globe, there should be deducted travelling expenses (immigration), $230; travelling expenses (Antwerp), $481, when there remains $13,611. Deducting the amount for salary, $10,000, there remains for contingencies, according to the Globe, $3,611. To arrive at the actual sum paid to the High Commissioner for contingencies the undermentioned payments made by official cheques must be deducted from the last estimate of $3,611, viz: 18K, October, W. Hall, water rates on official residence (before High Commissioner moved in 1884, October, T. Raynolds, insurance on official residence 31 December, W. McVoy, purposed 11 rates v lfeHS, January, B. E.

M. & M. U. are plaintiffs' attorneys, St. Jean Baptiste, At a largely attended meeting of St. Jean Baptiste Society, held on Wednesday night, it was decided that owing to the recent epidemic and the more recent floods, no public demonstration take place this year, but the members should rather try and relieve some of the distressed families. The next annual demonstration will take place in June, 1887, when it will be celebrated with great pomp. A HANNISSE, THE THEATRES, In the afternoon yesterday """"Engaged"""" was produced, and both the play and the way it was produced were worthy of better patronage. Gilbert and Sullivan have become so Damon and Pythias-like in matters theatrical that it is almost with difficulty one realizes that he is listening to Gilbertian dialogue and not have wafted to his ears from afar off some little bit from """"Pinafore,"""" """"Patience"""" or the rest of them. It is difficult to place this production in any category of dramatic nomenclature. Like most of Gilbert's works, it depends for its attractiveness on the wild absurdity of what, from lack of another word, may be called plot. This absurdity requires to be presented in a peculiarly nice manner, for which no guide can be found for comparison in the flood of modern plays, with which all are familiar. If not done enough the thing falls flat; if overdone it is made ridiculous, but not in the sense in which the ridiculous is funny. As the performance went yesterday it was a very fair interpretation indeed; but some of the dialogue left the auditor in doubt as to the nationality of the speaker. It is not often we have an opportunity of becoming acquainted with Gilbert's own work, and it is a pity that a greater number did not avail themselves of the performance at the Royal yesterday. In the evening """"As You Like It"""" was excellently presented, with Miss Pomeroy as Rosalind. THE RECENT INUNDATION, What the Relief Committee are Doing in the Aftermath of the Flood - The Health Department on the Qui Vive, In the districts recently inundated many deplorable sights are still to be seen, though the inhabitants have been very hard at work to put things in their former shape. Everywhere the sidewalks have been displaced, and it will be some weeks perhaps before these are replaced, and the cost to the city will be heavy. The warm weather will soon dry up those streets that are still in a muddy condition and, with the exception of the displaced sidewalks, matters will soon resume their wonted appearance. The water in the river is now fully a foot below the wharves and navigation will probably open to-day or tomorrow by the running of the Longueuil ferry, though reports have been received that the Longueuil and Laprairie have been somewhat damaged at Boucherville, but these will soon be repaired. Water still remained yesterday in some of the very low-lying portions of Point St. Charles, where the sewers are partially choked. Men are engaged in removing the ice on Commission street and the wharves. At the Point the schools will all be opened by Tuesday next. The St. Gabriel village school was very badly flooded, the water having reached to the tops of the desks. The Health department are watching very closely in order to prevent any evil results from the floods from a sanitary point of view through the sale of damaged flour and meat. Already nearly 6,000 pounds of meat which had been under water has been seized and carted away by the dead animal contractor. Parties whose houses have been flooded will be supplied with disinfectants by application at the Health office. Relief measures have been pretty fully carried out, and it is safe to say that little, if any, suffering now exists. Merchants and storekeepers on Craig street report an aggregate loss of nearly $11,000. On Mill street the loss is reported as not at all heavy. The Richelieu & Ontario company's sheds at the canal basin are demolished. The Great Northwestern Telegraph company have five wires down on the south shore, and poles are down and wires broken between Brosseau's and Laprairie. Men are repairing the damage. The wharves will no doubt require considerable repairing, and the revetment wall has been damaged in several places. The ice is fast disappearing under the effect of the sun and wind. Mr. B. Brown says that more than fifty years ago, standing with Mr. Tulloch, then an old man, at the bottom of St. Lawrence Main street, he said: """"I remember a great flood when a man went with a bark canoe from this point to Lachine."""" He added: """"There was then a small mill at the east corner turned by water from the mountain, and whenever they excavate for new buildings there they may find the old foundation."""" The ravine, now Ontario street west, may have been the mill pond. The late Captain Brush used to tell that in the year 1817 he wintered near Boucherville, when the spring flood submerged all the country up to Longueuil to a depth that has never been known since. The ice shove of 26th April, 1836, filled up the lower end of St. Francois Xavier street to the height of a three-storey building. Above Port street, where there was then no revetment wall, the ice stove in part of the front of a three-storey store and buried a one-storey dwelling house adjoining to a great depth, crushing a family inside. A gentleman who has copious notes in his diary on flood matters, in conversation with a representative of this paper, mentioned the following incident, which he called: At 2 a.m. this morning the water was still falling, though at a very much lessened rate, and, as far as could be judged, it is probable that the water will maintain its present level for a few days. The next rise in the river will occur in about a month, when the waters from the wood come down. This usually occurs between the 24th May and the 1st June. A FLOOD CATASTROPHE, So many of Montreal's spring floods have occurred in the month of April that, after the fashion of """"Old Moore's Almanack,"""" a calendar prepared for Montreal might well bear the stereotyped phrase in the month named, """"About this time look out for flood;"""" thus, for example, we have April 18, 1836; April 14, 1861; April 4, 1878; April 27, 1885; April 17, 1880, and a few others of which we have not the exact data at hand. Our object at present is to recount an accident which occurred on Monday, April 18, 1898, during the flood of that year. The following disaster, caused by an ice shove on that day, occurred on Common street, a little west of Port street, just above Kilbride's. The whole family was overwhelmed. About mid-day the ice shoved, and the Lake St. John, president of the St. George's society, said: """"There is great interest being taken in the proposition now before the house at Ottawa to construct a levee or dyke from the south bank of Victoria bridge to the Pavilion Road and to place a railway on this dyke to connect with the Grand Trunk at Point St. Charles and St. Henri, so as to utilize that dyke in some manner."""" It is said that among business men there is an idea that the proposed railway along the bank of the river between the Victoria bridge and the Pavilion road is intended by its promoter as a connecting line between the Grand Trunk railway and the Canadian Pacific, which it will meet eventually at or near the point selected for the site of the bridge across the St. Lawrence. However this may be, if the embankment will protect the city against floods, and at the same time prove of service to any or all railway companies, so much the better. INCIDENT OF THE FLOOD, An incident that might have had a very deplorable ending occurred to one of the employees of Messrs. Rogers & King, who live in Crétin town. It seems that he and his mother were seated at the supper table when the water rose so rapidly that they were obliged to take refuge on top of the table previous to making their way upstairs. To do this necessitated the securing of several chairs from the water to step on to reach the stairs. He stopped to the end of the table to do this, when the table tilted and he was plunged into the water, which in rising had lifted a trap door. Through this he went into at least ten feet of water, and with great difficulty managed to get out again, as the trap door was small and it took some time to find it under the water. Mr. B. Brown, of St. Lambert, lost by death on Wednesday a son of great promise, who was only 18 years of age. The deceased caught a severe cold while endeavoring to save some of his father's property during the recent floods. His death is much lamented by a large circle of friends. Not less true are those reductions on the origin of the American nation: """"The history of America does not really begin with the colonization alone of the Atlantic coast; the line of her Eastern families settling in the far West in one sense begins a history then; but no small part of what led to it and shaped the new life grew up in the place left behind; and there are ties still kept unbroken. So we in the New World, Norse, German or Italian, all one in kindred back in the past, look to an old home over the sea where a part of the race tamed for a look while, where another part has lived longer, and read its stone chronicle."""" Let us now see how Mr. Hunnewell has done the reading that he set himself. He begins as near the beginning as any hope of deciphering the ancient characters could justify. But with Early Britain he did not find much excuse for lingering long. After a comprehensive survey of the physical features of the island, he gives a brief account of Stonehenge and the other Celtic or pre-Celtic remains of the ancient Britons. He then turns his attention to Roman Britain, of which the treatment is much fuller. """"The scattered fragments of the Roman work that are now known, and scanty histories, show that the conquerors spread their arts and institutions through the country; that the population was considerable or was large; that there was peace, and a prosperity sufficient to support it and produce degrees of luxury. The native races, wild or slightly civilized, were Romanized, imperfectly, it may be, but made not unwilling or unprofitable subjects of the empire. Many of the ruling race were mingled with them and maintained the Roman usages and manners. Extensive forests and marshes that abounded were diminished, and the fields for crops or herds increased. Good roads for military or civil use reached to numerous points. There were strong forts, large towns and country seats. The great requisite was military strength and strong works were erected at intervals along the eastern and southeastern coast. Of these were Regnum, Fortus Adurni, Teveni, Lyne, Dover, Richborough, Heculver. Of some of these stations, the ruins are grand and impressive, and both, by letterpress and illustration, Mr. Hunnewell tries to convey a just notion of what they are and were. The Roman wall is described in its various details and the relics of Roman towns and villas have also due attention from the author's pen and pencil. A map of Britannia from Hubner the Vallum Hadriani being presented on an enlarged scale enhances the beauty and interest of this part of the work. """"Eagle and Swan in England"""" is discussed rather summarily there being few visible memorials of unquestioned authenticity of the 600 years from the departure of the Romans to the Battle of Hastings. This scantiness of the record is in marked disproportion to the influence of that period on the """"making of England."""" The centuries of Saxon and Angle predominance and of Danish power were not, says Mr. Hunnewell, """"times when the arts could flourish or that, as has been observed, produced enduring material monuments. Like far greater events that have transformed the structure of the world, they were those of preparation, showing, when ended, that, from the flood and fire and agitation, a superior place for man has been formed. No cathedral, wall or castle of importance now dates from them. We grope through their dimness; but we find that then an English people had been gathered and established in its home, and that the deep foundations of their character and power had been laid. What greater monument could rise from all the struggles of these six centuries? Mr. Hunnewell is much more moderate than Lord Macaulay in the share which he ascribes to the Normans in the civilizing of England. But, though he does not indulge in such glowing panegyric of the invader as, coming from the pen of that brilliant historian, offended Dr. Vaughan, he believes that to them the Saxons were indebted for that improvement in arts, letters, and manners which distinguished the later from the earlier England. Other writers of eminence hold, nevertheless, that the progress in those respects was due quite as much to the Saxons as to the Normans, and that the latter had gained as much by intercourse with their unwilling hosts as these by contact with the aggressors. They maintain, on the other hand, that whatever of excellence the Normans produced in either art or literature was posterior to their arrival in England, with the older settlers in which the credit must be shared. Possibly also hardly enough has been made of the effect of the Roman sojourn in Britain among the people whom the Romans, they largely dispossessed, also largely intermarried with. This is well brought out by the Rev. Prebendary Scarth in his excellent little volume on Roman Britain. Mr. Hunnewell has some interesting pages on the military architecture of the Normans who even, he says, surpassed the Romans by the grandeur of their mighty towers. He gives detailed descriptions of Pevensey Castle (a marked example of the manner in which they made the works of their Roman predecessors subservient to their purposes), Rochester (whose history reaches back into the years of fable), Dover (another adapted Roman work), Colchester (dating from about A.D. 43), and a copious index will also be appreciated by the reader. (Boston; Ticknor & Co.) A Story of the West, Mr. William O. Stoddart, whose story, """"The Talking Leaves,"""" charmed the hearts of so many boys, again offers his hand to the adventurous lovers of western life and scenery, and invites them to set out, under his guidance, for the mountain wonderland where the Indian still roams in cherished freedom. He assures us that there is still plenty to see and learn, and he takes it for granted that we are curious enough to wish to be of his party. He carries us at once in media res that is to a camp of very hungry Nez Perce Indians. They had been searching for their stampeded ponies, had failed and were in despair. Only one of the band had retained a spark of fortitude, and he, a boy, would not yield to circumstances. Instead of sinking into despondency, he went off on a hunting expedition, all by himself, and had the satisfaction of shooting two fine buffalo, and winning for himself a name. And it is after him that the book is called """"Two Arrows: a Story of Red and White."""" The white actors in the drama are not far off. By a coincidence, a mining expedition was just then nearing its destination, and what more natural than that Kyle Parks, the judge's son, should come face to face with Two Arrows? Their intercourse was to the advantage of them both. Kyle's apprenticeship in the mountains was followed, in response to the Judge's generous invitation, by Two Arrows' apprenticeship in civilized life, his sister also shared his advantages, and there are still others, we are told, in every band among those tribes of the west, ready to follow the example if only they are asked in the right spirit. (New York: Harper Brothers; Montreal: Dawson Brothers.) A Story of Atlantis, Mrs. Gregory Smith, of St. Albans, has for years been a diligent student of ancient races and creeds, which, with the aid of vivid imagination, she loves to clothe in the flesh of actuality for the instruction and entertainment of the modern world. In a work, once reviewed in this journal, """"Dawn to Sunrise,"""" she gave a series of sketches of the different types of religion which in various ages have swayed the human mind. In """"Atlantis: a Story of the Lost Island,"""" she raises from the depths of the legendary past that long submerged continent of which we read in Plato, and to which, a few years ago, the Hon. Ignatius Donnelly attempted to give real existence on the grounds of science and history. What matters it, reasons the latter author, that for thousands of years the legend was considered a mere fable? So was the tradition as to the burned cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, and sceptics cast doubt on narratives of Herodotus which modern discoveries have confirmed. There is nothing improbable in Plato's story; it is paralleled by what Vericott says of Peru. Mrs. Smith has a still ampler faith. She is convinced that in the far-off past there throve a civilization of Atlantean or American origin to which even our latest inventions such as the telephone were familiar things. Of this abandoned civilization she has endeavored to present a picture in the book before us. The story of Atlantis begins in the closing years of the reign of Kronos and ends with that awful cataclysm which, according to Hindu geology, took place eleven thousand four hundred years ago. It is told with considerable skill and, though it is not easy to be interested in parties so utterly shadowy, even from the standpoint of fiction, Mrs. Smith has managed to make unreal stage with a great deal of probability. The plot is well worked out, and some passages show a good deal of power. On the whole, """"Atlantis"""" is not unworthy of a place in that library of mythopoeic romance of which the works of Lyton, Kingsley, Melville, and Ebers may be deemed the masters. Mrs. Smith has the distinction of having written earlier than any of her predecessors for the creatures of her fancy to act their parts in. (New York: Harper & Brothers; Montreal: Dawson Brothers.) THE BOARD OF CHAIRMEN Blame the Harbor Commissioners for Causing the Recent Flood, A Deputation of Aldermen to Interview the Government - Ald. Granular's Opinion of the City's Committee, A meeting of the Board of Chairmen was held yesterday afternoon, when there were present A. P. W. Renton (chairman), Stevenson, Dubuo, Holland, Gray, Hennville, Beauvallet, Laurent and Eulrbalm. The Chairman, at the opening of the meeting, said it was a painful duty to call their attention to the fact that within the past twelve months the city had been flooded three times. The council had not done their duty in the matter. Though his firm was one of the sufferers, he was not speaking from a personal motive. He was of the opinion that before the legislature at Quebec closed, the City council should go to them to borrow money enough to forever put a stop to the floods. He also thought that a commission of eminent engineers, independent of their civic officials, the engineers of the C.P.R., the U.S., and the Harbor Commissioners should be appointed. What was needed was the best engineering talent of the age. He was pleased to see that in Parliament Mr. Curran had introduced a bill in connection with the floods. He was convinced that the parties to blame were the Harbor Commissioners, who had put obstruction in the form of wharves, etc. This question had more than a local aspect; it was a federal one. The City Clerk then read the following communication: OFFICE OF THE MAYOR, Montreal, April 21, 1886. I have been instructed by the Board of Trade to inform you that, at a meeting held yesterday afternoon, the destructive overflow of the river St. Lawrence here was the subject of very earnest consideration. It was very gratifying for the council to know that the Mayor and aldermen had taken some steps towards alleviating the personal suffering and destitution which have been caused by the distressing calamity, but the council of this board, in representing commercial interests, naturally gave special attention to the other consequences of the unparalleled and disastrous overflow, involving as they do untold loss to the business men of the city, and seriously interfering with our manufacturing and commercial industries. The council therefore begs most respectfully to recommend, as formulated in the annexed resolution, that His Worship the Mayor and the aldermen take prompt action in the matter of the portion of inquiring as to the cause of these consecutive inundations, and for the devising of a remedy against their recurrence. While the council is aware that economy in managing the finances of the city has to be carefully considered by the Mayor and Aldermen, it considers that in the face of such a calamity as has happened to the commerce and industry of Montreal liberal expenditure for its future prevention is an absolute necessity, and the council is convinced that it reflects the sentiment of the business community, when it says that any increased taxation, consequent upon such expenditure, as may, after mature deliberation, be decided upon, will be cheerfully borne thereby. I have the honor to be, sir, Your obedient servant, W. J. PATTERSON, Secretary. The Chairman quite concurred in the petition of the Board of Trade, and stated that he had been blamed for opposing the blowing up of the river by Dr. Thayer. (Laughter.) One thing the council must face was the immediate borrowing of about four millions of dollars to stop these floods. Ald. Laurin thought $500,000 would be sufficient. Ald. Fairbairn had been inquiring for half a century, and was convinced that the flood was caused by the accidental jamming of the ice. Ald. Gray moved that a report be made to council that a committee of three eminent engineers be appointed to investigate the cause of the floods and prepare a report thereon. Ald. Holland thought that Messrs. Lesage, St. George and Champagne had been taking information. Ald. Gagnier said these men had reported for years, but had never devised any remedy. The only thing possible was an independent committee. Ald. Stevenson referred at length to what the inundation committee had done, and to the success of their pumping operations. Ald. Usher suggested that a delegation of the aldermen be sent to interview the Dominion Government, as he held that the prevention of the floods was a matter for the whole country and not particularly for the city. He was of the opinion that the only remedy would be a system of piers on Lakes St. Francis and St. Louis. The Harbor Commission must also straighten the channel of the river; the Long wharf was a great obstruction and must be done away with. He was of the opinion that the civic engineers were perfectly competent to deal with the matter, but they had enough to do to mind their own business. Ald. Laurin moved that a Joint committee, composed of aldermen and members of the Provincial Parliament, be appointed to interview the Federal Government on the subject. Ald. Beausoleil said that the committee of chairmen were the most intelligent aldermen and that they ought to form the deputation. They ought to at once go to Ottawa and get an answer direct. The Chairman said it was no use going to Ottawa unless they had a good case against the Harbor Commissioners. He for one was not prepared to be laughed at. He was of the opinion that the most sensible proposition was that of Ald. Gray. Ald. Dorval said it was a well-known fact that the level of certain streets was too low, and the best method was to raise them. He thought that they should meet the Harbor Commissioners and together draw up a grand scheme and then approach the Government. Ald. Gagnier was convinced that the first thing to be done was to have a competent body of men to advise them. Ald. Stevenson said the members of the Harbor Commission were only mortals like themselves. There was one competent member on that board, the one appointed by the council. The Chairman was of the opinion that all other members of the board, except those appointed, were generally useless. He protested against the committee wasting their time in useless talk. The vote was then taken, and Ald. Laurin's amendment carried. Ald. Gray referred to a report in one of the papers where a reporter was stated to have quarreled with Dr. Larocque at the City sergeant's committee, for not producing the new provincial health bill. The doctor was perfectly right, as the bill had not yet come before the Legislature, and the copy in his possession could not be made public without the permission of the Government. The Chairman said it would be his duty at once to put the proceedings of the City committee in the City hall. They had always been a nuisance and more than ever. It was two or three individuals trying to run the city, and he trembled they would be bolder at home tampering with their own business. It was resolved to petition the Legislature to give the Council power to regulate the liquor traffic. The committee then adjourned. Communications, and supported by Mr. Lawson, and was carried unanimously, as was also a resolution authorizing the chairman to sign a petition to the House of Commons in favor of the bill. BLOCKED AGAIN, Washington, April 22, In the house Mr. O'Neill, of Missouri, again attempted to secure the adoption of his resolution declaring that the house sympathizes with Mr. Gladstone and his associates in their effort to secure a free Parliament for the people of Ireland and congratulating the people of that country on the prospect of an early and successful termination of their long and patriotic struggle for local self-government, but Mr. Swope, of Pennsylvania, interposed the fatal objection and though he subsequently withdrew it a demand for the regular order prevented action on the resolution. SERIOUS ANECDOTE IN THE AIR, Denver, Col., April 22, A special from Trinidad says: The steady rainfall of the last few days has increased the volume of water in the Purgatory river that it broke through the bank, flooding the lower portion of the town and destroyed many dwellings, the occupants having barely time to reach places of safety in their night clothes. One Mexican was drowned. The water works were flooded and the city's water supply cut off. The loss to property is $18,000. Father Ryan Very Ill, Louisville, Ky., April 24, """"Father Abraham J. Ryan, the poet priest of the south,"""" is lying critically ill with brain fever at St. Boniface church in this city.

18860125,historical,flood,"ONTARIO DESPATCHES, early Killed while Coasting Floods at Belleville, Belleville, January 23, The water in the river is rising rapidly, and not only extending the area of the flooded district but causing great inconvenience to merchants, many of the cellars on Front and Bridge streets having been flooded to such an extent as to put out the fires in the furnaces. The city buildings suffer the same inconvenience. Hamilton, January 23, Norman Counsell, the 12-year-old son of C.M. Counsell, banker, was coasting down the mountain today, when, in passing a team, one of the horses kicked out and struck the lad, fracturing his skull. The boy is not likely to recover. An agitation is being started to do away with coasting in the city limits. D. Sylvester, who left Halifax, N.H., early last week, having a number of unpaid bills, had received and accepted a call to the trusteeship of St. Luke's Church in this city. He had begun work here when his credentials were withdrawn by the Bishop of Halifax. Bishop Paret prohibited him from further work in this diocese and he will take the next steamer for England. He admits leaving a number of unpaid bills in Halifax, but says his salary was small and his expenses heavy on account of sickness. Fire in New York, New York, January 21, The firehouse of the West Shore Railroad Company and of the Weehawken Ferry Company at the foot of West 2nd Street was destroyed by fire this morning. Though the two-story building was entirely covered with corrugated iron, it was entirely consumed. The fire originated in the boiler room. The smoke was notably dense, and almost as soon as the fire was discovered the employees in the building were forced by the smoke to flee, leaving clothing, tickets, money, and everything else behind. The ferryboat Oswego was in the slip at the time but she steamed away before the flames reached her. Had she remained she might have furnished a vantage ground for the firemen, for the fire started on the riverside, and a stiff breeze from the west forced men away from the building on the land side, by sweeping the smoke and flames to the street. Hook and ladder companies stormed the building, but were driven back. Two lines of hose were lost and James H. McGowan, one of the hook and ladder men, suffered a broken leg. The weather was intensely cold, and the men and engines soon became coated with ice. The building, despite the fire inside, became sheathed with ice and when the interior fell there was a remarkable spectacle, as though a conflagration was going on inside an iceberg. A tank of naphtha at the works of the Manhattan Oil Company adjoining was also destroyed. The total loss is placed at $75,000. An adjoining slip is being used by the ferry boats. Seven Insane Brothers, St. Louis, Mo., January 21, Seven brothers, all raving maniacs, en route for the Jacksonville, Ill., asylum, passed through this city yesterday. The commissioner in charge of the lunatics states that prior to the war a wealthy farmer, by the name of Anson Arnold, settled in Hickory County, Md., with a large family. The acquirement of money seemed to be their highest aim in life, and the whole family of seven sons and five daughters deprived themselves of the necessities of life in order to gain it. About three years ago a stranger visited their home, and after convincing them that they could in a short time largely increase their wealth, imbued them to invest their all in what proved to be a mythical silver mine in Nevada. After months of anxiety they learned that they had been imposed upon, and all seven of the brothers, upon receipt of the news, immediately became afflicted with a violent form of insanity, which is the cause of their present trip to Jacksonville. The Florida Crops Damaged, Jacksonville, Fla., January 23, The Times-Union says from reports received, authenticated by a personal investigation, it appears that the actual money value to the growers of oranges rendered unmarketable by reason of being frozen on the trees is about $1,100,000. Young nursery stock in the northern part of the state is badly damaged. Bearing orange and lemon trees nearly down to the line of the South Florida Railway are injured to the extent of losing a large part of the fall growth on which the bloom comes, so that the crop of 1846 will be largely reduced. Pineapples in the same region, with guavas and other tender tropical fruits, are killed to the roots and will require a year to recuperate. Early vegetables have been badly damaged, but can be replaced. The whole spot money damage to the fruit and farm interests of the state will not be less than $2,000,000. The Colliery Catastrophe, Newburg, W. Va., January 23, It is now stated that there are thirty-nine men imprisoned in the mine in which the explosion of firedamp occurred yesterday. The bodies of Daniel Miller, Isaiah Timmons, acting pit boss, and his son were taken out of the shaft this morning. Their faces were badly blackened. Newburg, W. Va., January 24 Since yesterday the bodies of eleven more victims of the mine disaster have been recovered, making fourteen in all. They have been identified. A Fatal Boiler Explosion, Madison, Wis., January 23, The boiler of a locomotive in the roundhouse at the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul depot exploded last night, wrecking the roundhouse. He leaves a large family. Two others were injured, two seriously. No reason can be assigned for the explosion. The roundhouse and several engines were damaged more or less. Heavy Floods Predicted, Bismarck, Dak., January 23, Hunters who have been in the Rocky Mountains several weeks report in many valleys snow over twenty-five feet deep. Trappers and hunters who have been in the mountains for years state they never saw as much snow before. They predict heavy floods in the spring and an immense rise in the Missouri River. Fatal Fire in a Workhouse, Jackson, Mich., January 24, The county poor house was almost entirely destroyed by fire at one o'clock this morning. There were forty inmates and all escaped but five, who perished in the flames. The Apaches Driven Out, Albuquerque, FLOODS IN CALIFORNIA, A Great Storm Does Much Damage to Life and Property, Los Angeles, Cal., January 23 The rains of Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, supplemented by a cloudburst in the San Fernando Valley on the last named day, caused the Los Angeles River, almost without warning, to become a raging torrent and soon flooded the southern central part of the town. The water also covered 2,000 acres of orchards and vineyards, and rose two feet higher than the flood of February 1884. Over fifty houses were washed away or completely wrecked. Every bridge across the Los Angeles River was swept away, also several hundred feet of the track of the Southern Pacific and local roads. For three days the city was cut off from telegraphic and railroad communication with the rest of the world. Mrs. Kate Lyttle and Theresa Whitney were drowned while being taken from partially wrecked houses. It is thought a number of other lives were lost. A large quantity of livestock perished. Later telegraphic dispatches say that a woman and two children were drowned. The first train from the east arrived on Thursday night, via Denney. It will take a week longer to get trains north. The damage to the Southern Pacific Railroad is $150,000. There is no connection yet with San Francisco, where a heavy storm is raging. All the telegraphic wires between San Francisco and San Jose are down. The destruction of the wires is much worse than in the flood of 1884. The persons drowned were Theresa Whitney, aged 6; Mrs. Kate Lyttle, aged 33; and a Mexican named Refugio. Mrs. Lyttle had left the house, but went back after her jewelry. A floating house struck her, and she was drowned. An old rag picker named John Blank, living near the river, died of fright when the flood came down. Several hundred families had to leave home, but have mostly moved back. The damage has been done to the surrounding country. MARINE INTELLIGENCE, A NIKAMMIIIR HtVI, THE BRIGADE SHORT OF HOSE, Is it the case that for some days after the fire most of the reels had only about 200 or 300 feet of hose instead of 500 feet, the remainder being frozen up? I don't see how that could be as we have more than a double supply of hose, but at that time there were two or three fires every day, and the hose had to be properly thawed out before it could be used. In the new station we are to have a tower heated by steam pipes, and we will be able to thaw out and dry hose almost immediately. Do you think a water tower would have prevented the St. Dizier Street fire from spreading? Not at all, the water towers have been condemned by good authorities as utterly useless, for, although they may flood a room, they can only throw the water in a straight line, and cannot wash the ceiling as the men can do with the hose. If they had had No. 12 engine they could have got four good streams from it which would have been much better than a water tower. The streams the men had could not reach the flames as too many streams were taken from the one main. But the firemen are not altogether to blame in that affair. The fire took in an ugly spot and buildings are so high in some places that an 85-foot ladder, the longest made, cannot reach to the top. There ought to be iron fire escapes outside all high buildings with landings on each flat, the same as at the Gazette office. Then there should be water pipes running alongside the escape up to the roof with couplings on each flat. This system has been found very successful in Chicago. But the insurance men should not grumble whenever they have to pay out anything. They must expect to meet a few losses. They want to have everything their own way, and if they don't get it they say, We will put you down in class B, which would add considerably to their revenue. They have invited me to attend their meeting tomorrow, when I will give them every information in my power. They will send a petition to council in the afternoon asking (From the Tribune), We have very lately had a clear exemplification of the truth of an old saying, One must go from home to learn news. To our friends in the older provinces, we must long ere this have become a source of much uneasiness if not positive alarm. The eastern papers have for some time past been teeming with articles all more or less calculated to create the impression that the Blackfoot nation is on the verge of rebellion, if indeed the law has not already been set at defiance. All this cannot but be received by us as something more than news. In many quarters it has created much amusement. We too should crack our little joke, lunch and pass on to other matters which at first sight would appear to have more legitimate claim for consideration. But we cannot forget that the subject has been discussed in downright sober earnest; and as it affects us much more than the older provinces, we feel bound to give it full and public ventilation. In doing this, we presume and not, we think, without reason that our views would carry more weight and be accepted as more authentic than those expressed by the eastern press (not excluding Winnipeg, which have accepted the statements of unreliable correspondents). Our readers will be surprised that a reverend and possibly well-meaning gentleman residing at Winnipeg has asserted that the Blood and Peigan Indians can at a moment's notice put 20,000 warriors into the field. If this were the case what enormous proportions the Government returns would have assumed, and how mercilessly the Canadian ratepayer would have been taxed for the payment for Indian supplies. The residents of this southern country might well tremble in their shoes in momentary fear of total annihilation. There is no space for jocularity on this point and we would express, with all earnestness, our pity for our uninformed eastern contemporaries. A newspaper which, merely for the sake of making political capital, prophecies an Indian outbreak, is criminally culpable and so too is a correspondent, who to gain notoriety makes false statements of a sensational nature.

G. Stevens' bakery was pretty badly flooded, and the damage to flour, sugar, currants, etc., was estimated at about $710 The water came within six inches of the ovens E. Cadleux, hotel-keeper, 1929 St. Catherine Street, reported that 10,000 cigars, valued at $350, had been spoiled, as well as some minor damage to packages containing liquors The water also flooded the basement of A.

18930314,historical,flood,"FLOODS ALONG THE HUDSON, Edison Company Loses Half a Million at Schenectady, Y, March 13 Last night the ice in the Mohawk, west of the city, broke up and formed an immense gorge against the Fitchburg railroad bridge, three miles from here. The water overflowed the banks, flooding Edison Park and that part of the city occupied by the Westinghouse Company and the General Electric. The first floors of the Edison General Electric, which aggregates sixteen acres, are under water to a depth of three feet. Both plants have shut down and 4,000 men are laid off. Krousl Avenue, which is thickly populated, is under two and a half feet of water for a distance of about three-quarters of a mile. This cuts off half the streetcar routes and compels the use of the Electric Light plant for power. Much damage has been done in the canal. A mile south of the city at the point where the tracks of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company pass under those of the New York Central and Hudson River Railway, the foundation of the latter road has been washed away stopping all traffic between this city and Albany on the main line. Passenger trains on the Central are sent around by the way of Troy. No trains are passing over the Delaware & Hudson road. All the exhibits which the Edison Company were preparing for the World's Fair are practically destroyed by the water, as is also most of the machinery and stock on the first floor. The loss is estimated at over half a million. Nothing has been heard yet of the party who went to the Fitchburg railroad bridge to blow up the gorge with dynamite. Unless the gorge breaks soon more damage is anticipated. Merlons, Loss at Honesdale, RoMiotT, N.Y., March 13 The ice gorge in Honesdale Creek, below Eddyville, gave way late this afternoon and let a tremendous amount of water down the creek. The steamboats of the Cornell Steamboat Company and about fifty canal boats were swept into the river and driven helpless downstream. Many of them were badly damaged. The steamers Pittston and Adriatic, valued at $18,000, were so badly stove in that it is feared they will sink. A number of the canal boats were crushed like eggshells and sank in the creek. Never before has such wholesale damage been done in this stream. There were 18,000 barrels of cement stored in the Lawrence Cement Company's mill valued at over $10,000. These are a total loss; it is thought that the loss to the Cornell fleet will be about $40,000. There is no insurance. The loss to the Delaware and Hudson exceeded $5,000. The river continued to rise until 7 o'clock in the morning, when a point twenty-two and a half feet above the low watermark was reached, the water being thirteen feet higher than at noon on Saturday. Since then the water has been receding and no more trouble is anticipated. At Waterford a number of buildings on the bank of the Mohawk were demolished. Everything movable was taken away by the flood. The state dam at Cohoes, which has been condemned this winter by the state engineer, was badly injured. Unless the water recedes before night it is feared the dam will go out. The Champlain Canal crosses the river at this point, and should the dam go out navigation on the canal will be closed the greater part of the summer. Floods Out West, Chicago, March 13 Reports from the flooded districts in the Northwest indicate that the weather is generally turning colder, which will have the effect of checking the rise in the streams. Throughout the Northwest snowstorms are raging and in the upper peninsula of Michigan the thermometer has dropped 10 degrees. Snow is falling at many points in Wisconsin. In Eastern Michigan, however, the thaw continues. At Grand Rapids the river is higher than for thirty years and most of the factories have been obliged to shut down. Reports are received of great damage in the adjacent agricultural districts. Along the upper Mississippi, too, the ice is running out and much loss has been occasioned at Sioux City, Iowa, Hannibal, Missouri, and other points where boats have been swept from their moorings, bridges carried away and other damage done. In Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, March 13 The floods in the eastern section of Pennsylvania are abating and no further damage of a serious nature is anticipated. In the mining regions a number of mines have been flooded, throwing probably 4,000 men and boys out of work. It is expected that mining will be resumed in a few days. At Reading today two houses in the course of erection collapsed in consequence of their walls becoming water-soaked. Four workmen were severely injured. At Williamsport a water main supplying the western portion of the city was broken and the contents of the reservoir were emptied into the river. A Canadian Flood, Wam-acubuimi, Ont, March 13 The mild weather and rain of the last few days has melted the snow and ice very rapidly in this section, causing a tremendous flood in the Sydenham. The water has risen above high water mark. The ice in the east branch broke up this afternoon and gorged above the town, causing the water to rise so high it is flowing over the banks and flooding the farm lands in all directions. Many houses in low places are flooded and the occupants are moving out. This evening the ice below the iron bridge in town started sweeping down, broke the fastenings on the steam barge Ireland and a large tow barge carrying them down against the Erie and Huron Railway bridge, damaging one of the abutments so the evening train going south cannot cross.",

""""The trouble heretofore has been,"""" he said, """"in the fact that much of the legislation on the subject has savored too much of discrimination against one product in favor of the other. It is to permit the manufacture of oleomargarine and other substitutes for butter, on condition that it is to be sold at the factory under the revenue law, will deal in regulating the manufacture and diminish the chance of consumers being imposed upon."""" Dealers in genuine dairy products complain that the market has lately been flooded with butterine and other bogus butter from the U.S. They have been scattered among dealers throughout the country to a greater extent than ever before, despite the recent activity of the dairy commissioner and others.

RESCUED at Timbs Sergeant Lagniat, who was out at Lepine's grounds the other day, while walking through a field between six and seven o'clock, noticed an old man coming towards him. He suddenly saw the man disappear apparently through the ground. On running to the spot Lagniat found that the old person had fallen in a gully or rivulet and was besmeared with mud and almost suffocated. He lifted him up and carried him about forty acres to Mr. Lepine's, where he was recognized as William McLean, aged ninety years. The old man was in a critical condition and was taken to his home by the Maisonneuve police. The Late Mr. James Leishman The notice of the death of Mr. James Leishman, which appears in this day's Gazette, will be read with very great regret by a very large circle of friends of the deceased gentleman. Mr. Leishman went to Pembroke for business during last week in his usual good health, and while there he was attacked with what he supposed was an ordinary cold, but, feeling worse on Saturday, he returned home, when, possibly from additional cold caught in the journey, the trouble became aggravated, and he died at his residence, St. Antoine street, about 10 o'clock yesterday. Mr. Leishman was a very old Montrealer, and his widow and family will have the sympathy of a very large circle of friends in their great bereavement. The Recent Flood A walk around the recently inundated districts yesterday showed the vigor and effectiveness with which the Road department are repairing the damages done to the sidewalks.

Vigorous sanitary measures in view of the approaching summer season will be taken. The chief medical officer, Dr. Rodger, reports the flood to have not left the ill effects which it was surmised would likely result. RECORDER'S Court Before the Recorder on Saturday Elizabeth Williams charged Mrs. Newbury with assault and battery. The evidence went to show that on the night of the 12th Mrs. Williams was proceeding along St. James street. She was attacked by Mrs. Newbury and violently used by being kicked several times. Mrs. Williams, who is only 19 years of age and a prepossessing young woman, applied for and obtained a warrant for the arrest of Mrs. Newbury. The Recorder found Mrs. Newbury guilty of the charge and fined her $5 and costs. Magloire Cadleux, backman, for driving without lights, was fined by the Recorder 1 for eight days. Antoine Deroche and Israel Naitcel, for the same offence, were each fined 1 for eight days. Kate Nelson, St. Charles Borrommee street, for refusing to pay a carter the sum of $1.50, was sentenced to pay a fine of $5 or one month in jail. Magor, Lesage, Kennedy and M.H. Gault, M.P. The Chairman, in opening the proceedings, said that it would be unnecessary for him to enlarge upon the misery, destruction of property and depreciation of real estate. Those who were present were as well able as himself to form an estimate of this, as he to speak of it. The council of the Board of Trade had not been idle in this matter in the past. Early last winter they had come to the conclusion that the matter had passed entirely out of reach of amateur effort. It was a matter which could only be efficiently dealt with by competent engineers. The problem of the cause of the floods was one of the most obscure ever submitted to any man. Evidently the first duty is to obtain a competent professional opinion as to the means of keeping the water out. In his own opinion there were three things that must be done: first, by an embankment to keep the river out of the city; second, to clear the river of its drainage; third, to employ dynamite to break up the keystone of the dam. Whatever opinions might be held on one point, all would agree that eternal disgrace would rest upon this city if something were not done at once to prevent all risk of the occurrence of another such flood. The following resolution was moved by Mr. Silkhous, seconded by Mr. Julian, and carried unanimously: That this meeting recognizes with much satisfaction the declaration of the Dominion Government that the St. Lawrence inundations are to be made the subject of enquiry, and trusts that this enquiry will be made by a commission of first-class engineers, and be prompt, speedy and complete. Mr. Watt suggested that the other resolutions prepared by the council should be laid before the meeting at once so that they might know what they were there to do. The first resolution gave a great deal of praise to the Government. He wanted something more; he wanted to ask the Government for the funds to carry on the work. It ought to be distinctly urged and understood that the prevention of the floods was a matter for the Dominion Government. Mr. Clokholm thought that as the Government had given a decided promise to aid the city, this promise might be relied upon. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Lykas thought the Government had not treated Montreal with that generous consideration it had a right to expect. The Government should let it be known at once whether they were really going to cooperate with the city in preventing the floods or whether they were only going to give advice and moral support. (Applause.) Mr. Gollib moved a resolution calling upon the City council to cooperate with the Government and furnish the funds for the works, which must be undertaken for the protection of the city. He spoke of the large and valuable portion of the city which had become of but little value through the flood. Property in St. Ann's ward and Point St. Charles had depreciated 50 percent in the last ten years. We would soon notice an exodus from the inundated district. Those tenants whose houses have been flooded will be sure to leave so soon as their leases shall have terminated. The city must decide to pay for the works needed. It was well known that taxation was less in Montreal than in any other city of equal importance. The money for the works needed might even be raised by a special tax on the injured quarter of the city. It was better for the proprietors to lose 25 percent by taxation than 75 by inundation. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Would seconded the motion. The Mayor approved of the spirit of the resolution, but thought it was too much to ask the city to pay all the cost. The floods were getting to be a national affair. The banks of the river for miles were being flooded. Montreal is a port of transit; it is the port of the whole country and it is in the country's interests that the goods passing through here should not run the risk of being destroyed by the flood. He suggested that the wording of the resolution should be changed so as to let the Government understand that they were expected not only to give advice, but to give help. A deputation would be going to Ottawa next week to urge the case upon the Government. He hoped all present would join in this, so that the delegation might be as influential as possible. The motion was then altered to read as follows, and carried: That this meeting strongly recommends the Mayor and Aldermen of this city to confer with the Government in this matter, and to provide an equitable share of the funds for carrying out the works which are necessary for the protection of the city and localities affected by the flood. Mr. McLia then moved, and it was resolved: That the Board of Trade and Council representing the commercial and municipal interests of this city should be permitted to appoint one member of the commission, which in the opinion of the meeting should consist of not more than three members. Mr. Houghton moved, seconded by Mr. Alex. Marcus, and it was resolved: That not an hour should be lost, as it is hoped that arrangements may be made with the works for the protection of the city before the next season of next winter. A vote of thanks was tendered to the chairman. The Mayor announced that a public meeting of citizens would be held some day this week to consider the whole question. The proceedings then terminated. J. Deschamp, J. Guovillou, A. Courteau, J. Raccttu and B. Groulx. Mr. N. Dufort showed a nine months' pig, fattened by L. Hotte, of Ste. Rose, which tipped the scales at 870 pounds. The supply of poultry, eggs and butter was of excellent quality, and prices were exceedingly reasonable. There was a large quantity of maple syrup and sugar disposed of, and it is a satisfaction to note the superior quality of the present supply of this article as compared with that of former years, when it was a dirty black mass of stickiness. This improvement has been affected by the use of evaporating pans instead of the iron pots, and of tin sap pails and syrup boilers in place of the former wooden utensils. That old standard, Canadian tobacco in rolls, was in great demand. Altogether the visit to the Bonsecours market was somewhat disappointing. The display of meat at St. Ann's market was not up to that of former years, owing partly to the floods and partly to the late season of the year, the butchers being unwilling to expose any more than they could dispose of. On the whole the quality was good. There was very little attempt at decoration. Messrs. Leo Demers, jr., Alex. Courville, E. Charters & Sons, and Robert Nicholson may be specially mentioned for their fine display of beef and veal, and George Fisher and Masterman Bros., for their pork. The display of Easter beef in St. Antoine market was not up to the usual mark here, but the quality looked excellent. At Papineau market there was an excellent display of lamb, beef, veal and pork, salt junk. The market wore the usual decorations adopted by the butchers for the occasion and looked very pretty, which reflected much credit on all concerned. At St. Lawrence market the display of meat was inferior to that of former years, both as to quantity and quality. The stalls were tastefully decorated with roses, tinted paper, etc., and presented a very pretty appearance. PERSONAL INTELLIGENCE Mr. Mason, of Boston, is at the Windsor.

18850427,historical,flood,"5 THE DISASTROUS INUNDATION, Mater Rising Last Night at Point St, Diaries, DISTRIBUTING AID TO THE SUFFERERS Bridges Swept Away in the Quebec District, HOODS UP THE OTTAWA RIVER, A Man Drowned in the Storm-Several Firms Lost, Heavy Loss-The Business of Trade Has Been Disrupted, There has been no material change in the river since Saturday morning, for while the water would suddenly drop at one time it would quickly rise shortly after, and at a certain point last night the condition of affairs was very alarming, The leaving reached the highest point and steadily rising, The suffering among the poorer classes of Point St. Charles is very great and will not end immediately the subsidence, as it will take some time to have the houses thoroughly dried, and a situation serious as this may still All day Saturday the Point was the center of attraction for sightseers from the city and boats were in great demand, The price of passage was always above par and those lucky enough to be the happy possessors of boats did a rushing business in the passenger transport trade, The police in that district have been worked almost to death rowing people about from place to place, Some of them have been on duty for from 24 to 48 hours on stretches and have not received any remuneration, nor are they likely to, They have also been engaged the whole time in the laudable work of supplying provisions and fuel to the THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS, and they were much annoyed by crowds of individuals who, knowing that the police boats were free, hailed them on every occasion and with all sorts of excuses merely for the purpose of having a row through the flooded district for no other purpose than to satisfy their curiosity, But very little change was observable in the submerged portion of the city all day Saturday from the state of affairs already published in the Gazette, At noon the water was about ten inches lower than on the previous night, It then began to rise again until the evening when in front of the city it stood at 18 feet 0 inches, The appearance of the river changed very little, and with the exception of an open space of water above the bridge and another opposite St. Helen's island, nothing could be seen but huge piles of hammock ice, At an early hour on Saturday night about six full loads of ice came down from Lake St. Louis, and failing to force its way much further than the foot of the Lachine rapids, jammed against the edge of the stationary ice where it remained, thus closing up the space of open water, At the waterworks the hydraulic machinery was stopped by the """"backwater"""" caused by the rise in the tail-race, and all the steam engines had once more to be set to work, At the wheel house the water was sixteen feet above its usual level, The water is deepest on Centre, Magdalen, Grand Trunk and Favard streets, while on Wellington street from the bridge west to Turner's grocery store the depth of the water is on the average about five feet, Although the inconvenience of the residents of the Point has been very great since the commencement of the flood, no real suffering was experienced until Saturday, when it began to be much felt by the poorer residents of Magdalen and Centre streets, most of whom were completely shut up in their houses, unable to obtain the ordinary necessaries of life, A great many of these depend on their month's pay for their supplies, and pending this payment they have accounts at the grocery and butcher shops, and were without the ready cash to send to the city for what they needed, and as nearly all the places of business at the Point are submerged, and the contents either ruined or seriously damaged, the condition of these families is painful in the extreme, Alderman Tausey has been indefatigable in his endeavors to help the sufferers, and has done everything in his power to alleviate their distress in the way of purchasing and distributing provisions, but the number of boats at the disposal of the police at the Point is altogether inadequate for the task in hand, The members of the police force at No. 1 station are nearly worn out from overwork, and the authorities should engage both more men and boats to work in the relief of the distressed citizens, All day yesterday thousands visited the deluged district, and the boatmen again had a bonanza, The police boats were engaged from early morning distributing bread, meat and fuel, The condition of things is now terrible, and still the waters continue to rise, in the police station there is now about two feet of water on the main floor, although the station is on high ground, Fences, outhouses, etc., are floating about in all directions, and the bodies of fowls and other small animals are to be seen also floating in many places, THE LOSSES, No estimate that will come at all near the correct result can be made of the losses of the sufferers by the flood, but the fact is certain that every resident at the Point will lose in a greater or less degree by this serious disaster, Among the principal losses so far as known are Messrs. Pillow & Hersey, who had 15,000 casks of nails stored in their manufactory on St. Patrick street; their loss is estimated at $10,000, The Messrs. Ogilvie lose a large quantity of flour, and the Grand Trunk are also heavy losers, and they have issued posters notifying their employees that the workshops at the Point will be closed until the 1st of May in order to repair damage done by the flood, Mr. Harry Lomas will also be a heavy loser, as not only the basement, but also the parlors of his fine hotel have been flooded, The Point St. Charles school buildings are all more or less damaged, as are also the Methodist and Grace churches, NOTICE, Most of the houses in St. Lambert are deserted, the inhabitants having taken refuge either inland with their more fortunate neighbors, A large number of cattle have been drowned and thousands of bushels of grain destroyed, In Papineau things are in about as bad a condition, and the trains have been stopped, The water rose suddenly when the lake ice came down, and it is reported that considerable damage was done, but nothing reliable was ascertained, The farmers were all prepared beforehand, and most of them had removed their cattle, Several houses in La Tortue are reported to have been carried away, causing loss of life in some instances, but in this case also nothing definite has yet been learned, The water is rising fast at Ottawa, and it is feared the boats of the Ottawa River Navigation Company will be damaged, The bridge over the North river between St. Jerome and St. Adele has been carried away, also the railway bridge at St. Lin, Reports of similar accidents have come in from different places, The New York train was started out Saturday evening via Moore's Junction, and the Boston train by way of the Southern Eastern, The rising of the waters again yesterday, however, will interfere with the trains today if they do not recede, On Saturday afternoon a man was standing on the gallery of his house on Shearer street, gazing wistfully over the waste of waters, thinking mournfully of that little game of draw he was to have had with his neighbor over the way, when a cow came sailing past, A brilliant thought struck the genius, and he inveigled the animal near enough to the house to get on its back, and boldly set sail for the other side of the street, The bovine, however, had no interest in the game and was deaf to the allurements of the lack pots in perspective, so she stubbornly persisted in wending her weary way down the street, The gallant rider protested with his heels, but the fiery untamed was determined and finished up by discharging his rider into the swollen stream, whence he emerged a wetter and wiser man, On Saturday a horse attached to one of Mr. Clarke's field beef wagons strayed into a yard in rear of the Leahy property on St. Patrick street, and came very near drowning before he could be extricated from the wagon and taken to a place of safety, From one o'clock yesterday until eleven o'clock last night the water in the flooded districts had made a further rise of two and a half feet, AT LACHUTE, Messrs. C. Wilson & Co. have received the following telegram from Lachute: White's bridge is gone, Lane's bridge is broken, Fish's and Harron's bridges are in danger of going at any moment, The bridge on the West river is also gone, The North river was never known to be so high, the depth of water going over the paper mill dam eight feet thick, Last night, a mile below Lachute, Bannerman's flume and Karl's dam were washed away, Point Fournaise, April 25, The river is very high here and bids fair to rival the flood of 1870, The inhabitants were aroused at an unusually early hour this morning by ice from above the dam coming down, displacing in its course three guide piers and carrying away nine booms, Reaching the village it wrecked the wharves, scattered cord wood, dislocated a stable and a storehouse and coming in contact with the ice here, which is still firm, it created a great jam, which naturally increased the height of the water at this point, Water street east is flooded, and the inhabitants are moving, The steam ferry Nil Desperandum, which has been completely rebuilt, has taken shelter in Water street, Grain had to be removed from the granaries, Further damage from ice and rising water is feared, Business is at a standstill, CLEAR WATER AT QUEBEC QUEBEC, April 25, This morning the ferry company's three steamers commenced breaking up the ice bridge, moving in every direction, The whole mass moved down with the ebb tide, and the river from the Grand Trunk depot, south of Quebec, downward will be clear of ice tomorrow and the ferry service resumed on Monday, Quebec, April 28, A strong blow from the east set in last night, breaking up another large portion of the ice-bridge to a point a little below Cap Rouge, Large masses of ice are held stationary opposite the city by the strong wind, The water is covered with an immense quantity of saw logs and other lumber, which has evidently been carried down the Etchemin and Chaudière rivers by the floods, Numbers of men are out on the ice picking up the driftwood.",

Dussessu, for damage caused by the flooding of his cellar on St. Lawrence Main Street, and from Mr. Blalklock, for the flooding of his cellar on Guillebauld Street, were referred to the City Attorney. Aid Hood called the attention of the Council to the fact that the drain on Sherbrooke Street, between Union Avenue and University Street, was choked up. He also thought that the flooding of Mr. Blalklock's cellar on Guillebauld Street was caused by the clogging of the St. Lawrence Main Street drain, at the corner of Guillebauld Street, and it should be opened and cleaned at once. The City Surveyor was requested to attend to the matter. A letter was read from Mr. Butler, claiming $10,000 damages, on behalf of Miss Eliza O'Brien, for injuries received while passing along St. John Street recently by the falling of a piece of timber off a building in course of erection at the corner of St. John and Notre Dame Street, it being alleged that the city had not taken the necessary precautions for the protection of citizens. Referred to next meeting. An application from Mr. Leduc for a larger drain on Cadivas Street was referred to the City Surveyor for report. The Chairman submitted a report which it was proposed to make to Council on the petition of the Laculpe & Hochelaga Company, supported by the Grand Trunk Railway Company, to construct a branch of railway through St. Patrick Street from the C. I. Bear at St. Jacques First Law Hosiery Factory. This section of the country was this afternoon visited by one of the fiercest storms seen in years. About 3:45 a terrible rain from the southwest set in, the wind blowing a gale. Shortly after, hailstones as large as marble began to fall for several minutes. In an incredibly short time the torrent flooded the streets, the drains being insufficient to carry off the extraordinary amount of water. Several cellars under the principal store on Richlea Street were flooded, causing much damage. The street in several places was completely blocked by trees, which had stood the storm for thirty to forty years, but today succumbed. Piles of lumber were blown from the wharves into the river, and the lumber yards were hit heavily, the timber being blown hundreds of feet and broken to atoms. Fences were blown over in all directions. The gable end of the brick brewery was blown out, Miss Dwyer suffered heavily from the iron roof of her store being blown off. The rain poured through the wooden covering in torrents. To exacerbate the distress and hardly abated, it being the general topic of conversation, when the town was again aroused by an alarm of fire at the Victoria Hosiery Company building. The alarm was no sooner given than numerous firemen were frantically running to the windows at the upper story and on the roof. Through the presence of several of the authorities, all escaped. It is supposed to have originated from an old gasometer buried in the yard, and used some years ago to light the building, the conducting pipes from which run under the floor. The opinion is that these pipes had gotten stopped, and gas forming from a quantity of gasoline supposed to have been left in the reservoir, the flooding of the cellar today removed the obstructions in the pipes, when the gas escaped, causing a heavy explosion, which sent the fire and smoke up the shaft of the hoist and filled the upper stories. The damage from fire is slight and fully covered by insurance. Albany, June 8 A storm this afternoon caused damage estimated at $20,000.

that it had not appeared that the note had ever been discounted, or any claim thereto made on plaintiff Proof had been ordered before adjudging on this law issue It was further pleaded by Monk that the note in question was never delivered to him, but to the other defendant, as plaintiff's agent, to be discounted for the accommodation of the estate of the late John Monk; that defendant Monk never had possession of the note; that it never was discounted, but remained until past due in the hands of the other defendant The other defendant, Hetu, pleaded that the note in question was not delivered to him as plaintiff's agent, with instructions to have it discounted for the accommodation of the estate John Monk; that he had not succeeded in discounting it; that he was always willing to return the note to plaintiff if requested, but that he had never been so requested, and he had not considered it of any value The court held that plaintiff had a right, in the event of defendant's failure to return the note to ask that they be condemned to pay the face value thereof, or to ask for a complete indemnification for any liability for the amount thereof, and that he could only be completely indemnified by the payment of the amount of the note But the note in question being now prescribed, the defendants should not be condemned to pay the face value thereof, but they might be condemned to pay a certain amount by way of penalty and to indemnify the plaintiff for any trouble to which he might be exposed from the non-return of the note The court gave judgment against the defendants jointly and severally, ordering them to return the note to the plaintiff, or in default of doing so within 15 days from the present judgment, to pay the sum of $50 with costs of the present action, as brought De Beaujeu vs Shallow The plaintiff claimed the sum of $281 on an account, composed first, of a sum of $31 for printing an issue of the Journal, the Moniteur du Commerce, and, secondly, $250, amount of deposit in the hands of defendants The defendant set up a number of circumstances which he pleaded relieved him from liability The court held that the defendant had refused to pay plaintiff the amount due unless the latter would deduct from the account a sum of $50 for advertising in the Journal in question from December, 1895, to June, 1896 The defendant's pretension was that plaintiff was liable to pay this sum of $50, which represented advertising done by the Desmaulniers Printing Company which had previously printed defendants' Journal The court held that plaintiff was not subject to any liability incurred toward defendant by the company which previously did the printing, and judgment was given in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $281 claimed by the action Rateau vs Robert This was an action against the drawer on a draft which it was alleged that the drawee had refused to accept The plea was to the effect that there was no allegation of protest or notice, or that there existed any reason for dispensing with such protest and notice The plaintiff answered that a protest was not necessary as against the drawer of the draft, and that notice of refusal to accept had been verbally given to the defendant by telephone It was admitted that the draft was dated and made payable at Montreal and that the drawee resided in the city The verbal notice of non-acceptance of the draft, alleged by plaintiff, even if proved, could not avail as replacing protest Therefore in the absence of a protest for non-acceptance and notice to defendant, drawer of the draft, the latter was discharged from liability and the action was dismissed Rose et al vs the City of Montreal The plaintiff claimed damages suffered in consequence of her premises being flooded by the bursting of a water pipe on the 29th of March, 1896 It was alleged that the bursting of the pipe was due to the action of the frost, and that this should have been foreseen, and the pipe should have been placed at a sufficient depth to protect it from the frost The court maintained the plaintiff's pretensions and gave judgment in her favor for $100 By Mr Justice Archibald Cossette vs Desjardins The evocation to the Superior Court in this case was held to be unfounded, and it was ordered that the record be remitted to the Circuit Court By Mr Justice Da Lormier Foos vs Irvine Judgment for $305.72 on an obligation By Mr Justice Oulmet",

Ottawa, June 11 From a telegram received by His Excellency the Governor-General yesterday from Lieut.-Governor Dewdney, of British Columbia, in reply to an enquiry as to the extent of the Red river flood, it would appear that the press despatches have been greatly exaggerated. Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney says that the effects of the flood had been overstated; that the greatest loss was in this season's crops; that no lives had been lost; that at the time of telegraphing there was little or no news of stock having been destroyed, and that the Lieutenant-Governor would wire to His Excellency any information that he might obtain. It is not, therefore, likely that the Dominion Government will think it necessary to ask for any vote for the relief of the sufferers, as the loss and danger would not appear to be more than the local Government can attend to.

On the Pacific division the water had also fallen in some places, while at other points it remained at about the same level as a few days ago.

Lalonde, tailor, at 115 Notre Dame street. Chief Hebert and his men worked hard and in about fifteen minutes had conquered the flames. It is estimated that the amount of damage done is about $700. At 3:40 yesterday afternoon an alarm was sent in from box 151 for a fire which had broken out in a bedroom at the residence of Mrs. Barry, 113 St. Monique street. The flames were put out by two streams and a Babcock. The Salvage corps of No. 4 station saved twenty covers. The loss on furniture alone is said to be $3,000, but it is insured in the Alliance Insurance company. Thirty Years a Newsboy.

Advices from Valparaiso, Chile, give particulars of the disaster which occurred there on August 11. An artificial pond, eight hundred feet above the level of the city, burst, flooding the valley Yungar and several streets. The flood came down in an irresistible torrent, sweeping everything before it and bringing down wrecks and trunks of trees with it. The stream came rushing through the street San Juan de Dios in a wave twelve feet high. Shops were deluged and the contents destroyed. Houses were swept away and their inhabitants drowned or bruised to death. Fifty-seven persons lost their lives. The streets were impassable for a week after the disaster. The damage to property was at least $1,000,000. The pond belonged to a brewer named Nicholas Mena. Panama, September 26. Valparaiso advices of August 18 say the late storms and heavy rains have done much damage. From Serena south there is hardly a place which has not suffered. Houses have been unroofed or otherwise damaged, telegraph wires torn down, railway banks and bridges swept away, towns inundated and general havoc caused. Congress has voted $500,000 for the most pressing necessities of Valparaiso, but that sum is nothing compared with the millions of dollars damage which has been done. Copiapo was inundated and twenty-seven persons were drowned. Traffic on the railroad between Valparaiso and Santiago was suspended for a week. During the present winter Chilean freight vessels representing over 15,000 tons have been wrecked. In the early part of last week the weather for a couple of days was phenomenally hot. On Sunday morning a norther set in, and the Chilean barque Cristina Navarro came into collision with the Chilean barque Bilbina and both were wrecked and abandoned by the crews. The Chilean barque Maxima was carried on shore and broken up. The crew reached other vessels. The American barque Success was driven ashore and broken up. The French barque Etoile du Sud dragged down to the British barque Cambrian and both foundered. A portion of the crew of the Etoile du Sud jumped on board of the Cambrian, but, with one exception, they all perished. The British barque Glentile collided with the Chilean barque Vanora and was knocked to pieces. All of these vessels carried valuable cargoes. Several Chilean steamers were badly damaged.

WEDNESDAY, MAY 10, 1830 LEGAL INTELLIGENCE SUPERIOR COURT - JUDGMENTS (Montreal, May 8) By Mr. Justice Pagnuelo, The Canada Jut Company v. The Olobort Mitchell Company, the company plaintiff claimed damages resulting from its establishment by water that escaped from automatic fire sprinklers, which had been replaced by the company defendant on the ceiling of plaintiff's factory as a protection against fire. A fire had occurred, and the company defendant had undertaken to replace the sprinklers. Subsequently, an escape of water occurred without fire. The company plaintiff alleged that the escape of water was due to the bad workmanship of the defendant; that the sprinklers were constructed to operate automatically on being subjected to a certain temperature, and in the event of a fire in a building and the temperature rising, to open automatically and allow water to flow, thus extinguishing the fire; that a gong was attached to the system of sprinklers, which was intended to give an alarm outside and inside the building of the fact of the flow of water from the pipe serving the sprinklers; that on the 6th February, 1917, one of the sprinkler heads burst and allowed the water to flood the factory, as the gong did not work and give the alarm of flooding, and it was only discovered on the Monday morning; that goods were destroyed to the value of $658.50, which amount plaintiff claimed from defendant. The defendant admitted the fact that it had replaced a large number of sprinkler heads, including the one which burst on the 6th February, 1917, and had placed the gong, but defendant pleaded absence of warranty as to the gong; that defendant's work to the sprinklers and the gong was performed in a workmanlike manner, and when completed, was examined and accepted by the plaintiff, and that, thereupon, defendant's responsibility terminated; that the electric gong was under the supervision and care of the plaintiff and his employees, who had the means of testing the same constantly, and who should have done so. It was further pleaded that the loss suffered was not due to any fault on the part of defendant, but was due to the plaintiff's fault and negligence; and finally, that the amount of damages asked was excessive. The court held that the damage was caused, according to the evidence, by the sprinkler head opening of itself without any heat to start it, one of the links soldered by defendant having broken without any apparent cause; that no such accident had ever happened to any of the old sprinkler heads, but only to those refitted and replaced by the defendant. The court was of the opinion that the defendant was responsible although no special warranty was given. Judgment was rendered in favor of the company plaintiff for $658.50, amount of the damages established. Brown vs. Torrance. The action was on a letter of guarantee given by defendant to plaintiff for the payment of goods sold by plaintiff to one W. FALL WHEAT. The weather during the winter and the early spring has been exceedingly unfavorable for fall wheat, and as a consequence the crop, which promised well before the snowfall, has been greatly injured by the inclemency of the season, and practically a failure in many localities. The want of snow in most places left the ground exposed to unusually severe and protracted frosts, and the heavy rains formed pools of water which froze and killed the young plants in the hollows and flooded lands. The dry weather which has prevailed in some neighborhoods since the opening of the growing season has also wrought some injury. A considerable percentage of the area sown to fall wheat is being ploughed up. As a rule, this crop appears to have wintered better on clay or heavy land than on light soils. In many cases, it has been observed that the partial protection afforded by accumulations of snow near the fences, the rest of the field being bare, has saved the wheat plants thus protected. It is worthy also of note that the reports from Algoma, where there was a good covering of snow during the winter, are more favorable than those from the older settled counties. There are slight losses from insect pests reported, wire-worms and the Hessian fly having appeared last fall in a few localities in the western part of the province. At the time correspondents wrote, rain was urgently needed at several points to ensure the remaining crops. CLOVER. A large proportion of the clover crop in every section of the province has been winter-killed, owing to the scarcity of snow, the plants being either heaved or frozen in the ground by exposure to the severity of the weather. The damage appears to have been greatest in the Lake Erie and Lake Ontario group, while the most favorable showing is made by northerly localities, where the snow remained on the ground to a later date. Where the crop survived the winter, the fields are generally in a healthy and flourishing condition, and promise well, although, in some quarters, clover is beginning to suffer for lack of moisture.",

that in 1890 the same drain burst and caused plaintiff damage; that the plaintiff further protested on the 2nd September, 1893 The plaintiff claims $500 damages The defense was to the effect that if plaintiff's premises were inundated from the drain, it was due to unforeseen and uncontrollable climatic causes;

From early morning till late at night boats, improvised rafts and curious forms of watercraft plied from point to point where twenty-four hours earlier a busy vehicular traffic was carried on. Business was, perforce, suspended in a large part of the city specially devoted to commerce, and merchants and clerks spent the day in a disconsolate state, seated out of the reach of the tide that had invaded their premises, and watching it ebb and flow as the water numbered lightly the advantage over the icy impediment that kept it back from the ocean, or, when the temporary relief ended, came back a little further, and left its trace on the walls or roadway a little nearer the highest mark of 1886. This was in the city. In the residential quarter, in St. Ann's ward, the scenes were sad indeed. Factories were stopped, and the breadwinners of many a family spent the day in most unhappy frame of mind, counting up the damage that was done to their stock of worldly possessions, damage that was all the more felt because of the difficulty with which alone it can be made good. To relieve the temporary wants of these people the City Council has taken prompt measures, and food and necessaries will be distributed wherever required. THE BEGINNING OF THE TROUBLE, Shortly before 5 o'clock yesterday morning a large mass of ice came down from the lakes and crashing through the river ice caused a jam about the foot of St. Mary's current. The water backed up rapidly, and in a short time began to overflow the revetment wall and spread out over Commissioners Street. The pumping engines were kept at work until 6 o'clock, when the water had reached the height of the sluice and the men were compelled to leave their posts. Higher and higher the water rose, until St. Paul Street was submerged from St. Francois Xuvier to McGill Street, and clerks coming down to business found themselves cut off from the stores. The water rushed up McGill Street past St. Ann's market and the Albion Hotel, but the ground here being more elevated the rise of the water was much less rapid. It crept up, however, inch by inch until there was a depth of three feet opposite the door of the hotel and the office was flooded out. The water all the time was rushing westwards through Griffintown, until all the streets were submerged to a depth of three or four feet. A crowd of harpies hovered around in boats offering to ferry merchants to their stores at the rate of about $10 an hour. No matter how short the distance was asked. THROUGH THE BAD DISTRICT, Finding a boatman who was sufficiently reasonable to accept $2 an hour, a Gazette reporter proceeded to visit the flooded district. McGill Street was perfectly free from ice, but on turning into William Street a confused mass of floating sidewalk, ice, barrels, etc., was met, which was rather dangerous for such frail craft as were endeavoring to push through. The boatman, too, did not appear to be as skillful as he was reckless, and the consequence was that the boat had hardly left a lamp post before it came broadside on to a telegraph pole. This was rather startling at first, but after a little one became used to it, and did not mind it much. The streets in this vicinity were covered with about two feet of ice, and consequently the water was so shallow that the boat grounded every few hundred yards, and the boatmen had to stop over the side and tow it along until deep water was again reached. The current kept running faster and faster until it reached a speed of about two miles an hour, greatly increasing the difficulties of navigation. At every street corner boats would shoot out most unexpectedly, and collisions were innumerable, but accidents were remarkably rare. THE HOUSES along the street being rather low, the water reached in many instances to nearly the tops of the doors, and the inhabitants had retired to the upper flats, and every window was filled with anxious faces gazing despondingly at the rushing waters below. The younger people, more eager to get a good deal of amusement out of the general calamity, their ingenuity, sharpened by previous experience, enabled them to construct rafts or boats out of almost anything that came in their way. The commonest craft was a section of wooden sidewalk with barrels or chairs for seats, and propelled by poles. One young man, more luxurious or more ingenious than the rest, nailed two pieces of wood crosswise on each side of his raft and placed his oars in the forks. Seated on a cushion chair he rowed slowly down the street, stopping under a gallery here and there to call upon his friends. Two young men secured a section of sidewalk about twenty feet in length, and by placing forms on it provided accommodation for quite a number of their lady friends. Numerous other homemade batteaux were met with. These were constructed of rough planks, with flat bottoms, sloping up at each end. Some of these were fitted up with trim bows and the name smudged on with ink or blacking. Allowing the boat to drift along with the current the hay market was soon reached. The water pouring in from different points created whirlpools broken here and there by piles of hay which had to be abandoned when the water rushed in. The clerk of the market sat at the door of the office, smoking with the calm deliberation of Indians, and casting an occasional unconcerned glance at the surging waters beneath. The building is a substantial one, and there was no likelihood of the water coming up as far as the roof. A horse attached to a light cart had a narrow escape here. The owner had only just time to run to the stable and hitch up when the water rushed in. He drove up Duke Street, the horse swimming most of the time. On Astry Street at William Street, where the deposit of ice made the water much shallower, the horse attempted to climb up, but fell back repeatedly, and it was only after considerable trouble that the animal was rescued. A strange object was next seen floating down with the current and colliding with the street lamps on the way. It turned out to be an ice floe, with a vitriol cask in the center. Just as it reached the hay market it ran into a wall and the cask smashed. The hydrants around the market were all but covered with water, and boatmen had to keep a sharp lookout. A long piece of sidewalk floated down Inspector Street, and became stranded across William Street, blocking the way in this direction, and the water here was rather shallower, and all around were planks, empty barrels, dead fowls and dogs, ice floes and articles of clothing, making it somewhat unpleasant for the boatman. Whole families could be seen at every window, the men being prevented by the flood from going to their work. Everyone seemed desirous of going somewhere and every boatman who passed was delayed with supplications to take them on board, but in most cases the cries fell upon deaf ears. People who seemed to be in even equal poverty were eagerly offering 50 cents to be taken to McGill Street to make their purchases, but these offers were rejected contemptuously by the watermen. It was said that the police were out in boats, but if so no one seemed to have seen them. The families in the lower tenements had been taken in by their more fortunate neighbors upstairs, who did everything in their power to help them, but the water had risen so rapidly that they had only been able to save a very small portion of their belongings. """"WE ARE PRETTY CROWDED,"""" said a man from an upper window, """"I have two families here besides my own, little to eat and no means of getting more for the present. But we poor folks have got to help each other, and it might be my turn next,"""" he said with a resigning air. """"It's a good thing for us the weather is warm."""" This was the general feeling, and not a grumble was heard anywhere save at the authorities whom the people seemed to hold responsible for the calamity. Considerable amusement was caused by the frantic endeavors of three girls to navigate a huge barge along the street. When last seen they were hopelessly stranded on an ice sheet, and half a dozen of the gallant Griffintown gondoliers were hurrying to their assistance. At the corner of Ottawa and Murray Streets a dam had been formed by stranded icebergs, pieces of sidewalks and the other wreckage with which the street was littered. Over this the water rushed like a mill race and a rowboat which ventured too near was drawn into the vortex and swamped. Its occupants crawled out half drowned and managed to rescue their boat little the worse for wear. A policeman who seemed to know as much about a boat as it did about him was soon rowing laboriously along and to all appearances making a point of running into everything that he could possibly come within reach of. When he said he was going to the station an incredulous smile crossed the faces of the spectators, but in such little veneration are the police held in this district that no one would go to his assistance. A stop was made AT THE GAS HOUSE, where the manager, Mr. John Power, was seen. He stated that the valve on Craig Street cutting off the mains in the lower town had been completed that morning and there was no danger of the upper portion of the town being left in darkness, it being supplied with gas from the works at Hochelaga. The water was at that time (3:15 p.m.) three feet below their fires, and until these were extinguished there would be no stoppage of work and they would be able to supply the district with gas. The mains were perfectly clear of water and would remain so unless some of the lamps were knocked over and the pipes broken. The company had a steamer out to pump any water that might get into the mains. A visit was next paid to the works of the ROYAL ELECTRIC COMPANY, the manager of which reported that no damage had yet been done, and he did not anticipate any. The streets, he said, would be lighted as usual. Passing along to No. 3 fire station, Guardian Gilbert was standing at the door almost up to his waist in water. He had moved his horses and reel up to the Central station and fitted up one of the corporation barges as a fireboat with hose, axes, etc., and was ready for any emergency. The water extended as far as the Montreal Warehousing Company's building which was reported dry. Every attempt to get up to Notre Dame Street failed and the boat had to return the way it came. On the sidewalk opposite Mr. Loughman's store stood a poor man whose raft had been determined to go with the current and in the struggle had gone its own way, leaving the steersman in the water. He had crawled up on the sidewalk, and was kindly treated by Mr. Loughman until the arrival of the reporter, who ferried him to his home, a wooden shanty a little way down the street. The door entered from a back yard, and opposite it a raft was moored. The man stepped on the raft, which tilted over, landing him once more in the water in the presence of his whole family, who were watching him through two little windows. He got to his feet, however, and, half swimming, half walking, managed to work his way to the stairs, up which he scrambled. His better half had noticed meantime that the raft had broken from its moorings and was floating away, and straightway she ordered the poor man to go down and tie it up. Remonstrances were useless, and he had to go down once more and wade through the submerged portion of the house to catch the raft. """"This house is showing signs of giving way,"""" said the worthy dame; and in answer to the question why she did not leave it, she pointed to the water through which the husband had been compelled to wade, and said indignantly, """"Me walk through that? Not such a thing!"""" Stifling a quiet laugh the reporter departed. Part of Duke Street where the snow was unusually high was perfectly dry. In Queen, Prince and several other streets the sidewalks had been moored to the houses, and numbers of the residents had brought out chairs and tables, and were having a quiet picnic, while others were sitting on sofas in the genial warmth of the sun. A visit was next paid to the locks, where it was found that the river was almost on a level with the canal. There was a good deal of open water in front of the city and a few wild ducks were seen. THROUGH GRIFFINTOWN, Another reporter procured a boat on McGill Street and proceeded to investigate how the inhabitants of Griffintown were faring. The craft was named the Tourmaline, but it is needless to say did not resemble the gallant frigate of that name which once honored Montreal with its presence. Passing the Albion and Western Hotels, which were partially submerged, the imprisoned guests and employees gazing blandly on the lively scene outside, as all sorts of craft were thronging the turbid waters. Sulling down College Street, it was noticed that there was about six feet of water in the cellars of Messrs. H. & I. Leveridge & Co., and that the door of the office of the ashes inspector was halfway under water. On St. Henry Street there was still four feet of snow, and Mr. Chaffee, the proprietor of Lowe's Hotel, had utilized this as a roadway to his house, by placing a large plank into the doorway. Here there are five feet of water in the cellar. All the houses on College Street were partially submerged, and the hay market presented the spectacle of a large lake, the weigh house looking like an island in the center. The depth of water here varied from three to four feet, and navigation was rather perilous, in consequence of large blocks of ice, and the wooden sidewalks, which had broken adrift, floating about. Turning up Inspector Street into Chaboillez Square was like going into a miniature swamp. The stores were all closed, and those proprietors who had been fortunate enough to secure their sidewalks had manufactured them into floating pontoons. The floor of No. 4 fire station was quite under water. The scene was an animated one, with boats and canoes carrying people from their residences to terra firma, and express wagons carrying whole families. The water was all around. THE GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY STATION, but these standing high were at 4 o'clock quite dry. The track at the Lachine depot was quite under water, and it was learned that the cars had been removed and that trains would start from Fulford Street. In St. James Street, the water had penetrated and was pouring down Little St. Antoine and Little Craig Street, into Craig Street proper. At the Chaboillez Street police station were a number of boats, and the police, under the superintendence of Sergeants Kehoe, Carboneau, and Beattie were doing their best to render assistance to the imprisoned families. Rowing along Notre Dame Street the reporter's boat met with its first accident by running into a horse and nearly knocking it over, and many were the oaths vented on the heads of the oarsmen. Kennedy Street resembled a canal, and here again all the stores were closed and the houses submerged, as there were fully four feet of water, while the yard entrances looked like the mouths of gigantic sewers, with the filthy water pouring in, the effluvia from which was at times very unpleasant. An enormous amount of water was flowing into the houses, and it was rising steadily, notwithstanding that it had been propped up by beams. Turning into Ottawa Street at the corner of Murray, a stray sidewalk was found right across the street, which formed a sort of weir over which the water was rushing. When the boat hit the weir it nearly canted over, and sent both reporter and boatman into the surging flood. Happily, however, it righted, and they were saved for a better fate. Here the water was about four feet deep, and inside of the houses could be seen tables, chairs and other articles of household furniture floating about, while the residents had migrated upstairs, and with disconsolate faces were wondering what would come next; and it must be said that the City Council did not come in for their best wishes. Turning down McCord Street a similar state of things was observed. ST. ANN'S CHURCH and adjacent buildings stood like an island in an inland sea. A novel sight was witnessed here, a father paddling a raft, with his young family seated on chairs on it. The saloon at the corner of Murray and McCord Streets formed a bold promontory jutting out into the waters, and it seemed to be doing a roaring business. A young lad paddling a raft up Murray Street seemed to take the flood well, as he sent his craft along singing at the top of his voice the tune of """"A Life on the Ocean Wave."""" Sailing back along Murray Street, a detour was made into William Street, all the houses here also being partially submerged. Clondrimeng's foundry was under water and the works stopped. On the hay market A PARTY OF SWELLS, with yellow kids on, """"out to do the flood, the proper thing, you know,"""" was coming gaily along in a craft which was a cross between a gondola and a canoe, when they came into collision with a lamp post, and their boat toppled over in about four feet of water. The appearance of these (lately) swells as they emerged from the water, looking every inch like half drowned rats, called forth roars of laughter from a bevy of young damsels who were taking their seats on an adjoining house top. At the corner of Nazareth Street, a drunken man, whilst high in the water, had anchored himself to a lamp post and was frantically entreating to be taken away, but he was only advised to taste a drop of the strong liquor, with which he was surrounded. The current on William at the corner of Prince Street was so strong that it resembled a rapids on a small scale, and numerous were the collisions, though without any serious accidents. Standing near here on a raft, paddle in hand, stood John McKinnon, late boatswain of the Grecian, eyeing the crowds of amateur navigators with looks of disdain, which are the peculiar privilege of an old salt. On Queen Street Ives' foundry was found to be flooded and all work stopped, as was the case in the St. Lawrence Sugar Refinery. In the latter there will be very little damage, as the precaution had been taken to remove the barrels of sugar beyond the reach of the water. In Grey Nun Street the cellars of A. W. Tester & Co. were flooded, as was the wallpaper factory of John C. Watson. In the latter, Mr. Winter, the engineer, with commendable foresight, had kept the engine working to the last minute, and by removing most of the perishable goods to a place of safety, a piece of prudence on his part which will no doubt be duly appreciated. On Foundling Street barrels, straw and pieces of wood were huddled together floating about; while on the steps of several of the stores were clerks, anxiously awaiting for a boat to take them safely to town. There were about three feet of water on St. Paul Street, as far as the Custom House Square. From conversation with several proprietors of stores on this street, it was learned that the loss will not be nearly as much as last year, as they had not put much time in the blasting operations and had prepared for the worst. At Young Street police station there were three feet of water on the floor. There were five boats stationed here and the police were kept busy all day in transporting parties to and from their work. Turning along Commissioners Street numerous large ice floes were encountered, and it was impossible to get past the Custom House. The Examining Warehouse and the Harbor Commissioners were flooded to a depth of several feet and the Custom House was in a like plight. Two forlorn looking individuals were standing on the wooden sluice at the pumping station. They related in a doleful manner their experiences of the morning, and told with pride of how they had stuck to their engine to the last. In a glove store on St. Paul Street the clerks were seen standing on one of the tables waiting for a boat to take them off. In another store, not far off, the employees, more ingenious, constructed a raft of loose planks, buoyed up by four empty casks. Everywhere the inventive faculties of the people were taxed to the utmost. AT THIS POINT, Last night it was impossible to reach Point St. Charles except by boat, and as Wellington Bridge was not passable by the latter method a reporter chose his route via Seigneurs Street Bridge. At 8 o'clock it was found that on Craig Street the water had got as far as the Young Men's Christian Association building, so a detour had to be made along Latour Street to get on St. Antoine Street. Driving along it was noticed that all the streets, comprising Mountain, Aqueduct, Versailles, Guy, Richmond, St. Martin, Seigneurs, Chatham and Canning were flooded between Notre Dame and St. Antoine, the deepest part being on the railway track. Fulford Street was dry and at the railway presented an animated scene, as it has for the present been transferred into the depot. On each side were numerous vehicles setting down and taking away parties who had arrived or were starting by the cars. Proceeding down and turning into Seigneurs Street, the canal bridge was crossed, but halfway down Shearer Street the flood was reached, and when the cab wheels got two feet deep in the water Jean Baptiste, the driver, got so frightened that he declined to proceed any further, saying his vehicle would upset and he would be drowned. He did not seem to consider the valuable life of the reporter inside at all. However, there was nothing to do but to take a boat, and embarking on the turbid water the police station was reached in Grand Trunk Street. Here were stationed four boats, which were rendering good service, under the superintendence of """"Adjutant"""" Bilke and Sgt. Cambridge, in ferrying the inundated people from one place to another. Centre, Magdalen, Boucherville and Congregation Streets were all under water, and though numerous families residing on ground floors were rendered homeless, their more fortunate neighbors upstairs kindly accommodated them, and all seemed to be sinking the best of a bad situation. Expecting the flood, nearly all the small shopkeepers had removed their perishable goods to a place of safety. They then closed their stores, and were waiting patiently for the river to resume its normal condition. Wellington Street was dry, and so was St. Patrick Street, and the inundation here was greatest at what is commonly known as Goose Village, situated beyond the Grand Trunk offices, on St. Julien Street, and the little cluster of buildings about Conway, Forfar, and Britannia Streets were entirely inundated, and the water was still rising. The neighborhood of the Exchange Hotel and Horse Exchange was dry, and the numerous valuable horses in the custody of Mr. Kimball were all in excellent condition. The Grand Trunk workshops were closed, the furnace rooms being covered with water, though the yard was almost dry. ALONG CRAIG STREET, At 8 p.m., the water touched the highest mark, which was about eight inches below last year's flood. Craig Street was flooded from Victoria Square to the rising ground on St. Antoine Street, St. James from opposite Notre Dame from a mile down to Mr. Brouillette's store, a considerable distance past Chaboillez Square, and the intersecting streets were covered to a depth of several feet. The water had also risen on Craig Street at the corner of St. George, Bleury, Alexander and Hermine Streets. The water then began to subside, and by midnight had fallen nearly two inches. The cellars along Craig Street are filled. In the afternoon the engine room of Mr. Chanteloup's factory was invaded, and a little later the Gazette's office underwent a similar experience, necessitating a stoppage of work. The Herald also suffered in the same way. ST. LAMBERTO AND THE TIVULAPRAIRIE ROAD FLOODED, It is difficult to get much information from the south shore. The rise of the water has flooded the flat country adjacent to the river for 500 or 400 yards, and in some places further back, and the road to Laprairie is reported to be covered with ice. People living at St. Lambert, above the bridge, turned their cattle out and left their houses, coming to the village, which is in some places under water. From Longueuil it is reported that two houses have been carried away. In the south channel between St. Helen's Island and the shore the ice is piled up in great lumps, thirty or forty feet high, resting on the bed of the river, and blocking up the channel. A heavy shove took place in the afternoon, the abutments of the Victoria Bridge receiving the force of the shock, and heaping up the floes to a great height. DOWN THE RIVER, THE WATER MEANING SLOWLY MOVING AT SOME ANGLES AROUND, (Special to the Gazette) Longueuil, April 22, 8 p.m., Water rising slowly; ice not moving at all. Verchères, April 23, 8 p.m., The water is not very high, and people crossed on foot today from the village to the island. L'Assomption, April 22, 7 p.m., The ice moved this morning above the village. The water is rising slowly. Varennes, April 22, 7 p.m., The ice is firm here. The water went down a little yesterday. To-day the water is the same as yesterday. Sorel, April 22, 8 p.m., The ice is moving from tonight and water keeping very high. Gaspe, April 22, 7 p.m., The ice moved from here at 5 p.m. WHAT SOME THINK, The Editor of the Gazette, Sir, Allow me through your columns to draw attention to the fact that last year our fire engines were used for pumping cellars out. It seems we have two new forms for the public. If such work as pumping cellars is very beneficial to such good men, there are some old engines in the service perhaps not fit for much else. If cellar pumping is necessary, could not they be pressed? Respectfully yours, Citizen. A BELIEF IN THE DYKE AS THE ONLY POSSIBLE EFFECTIVE REMEDY, A contributor reviews the occurrences of the past year, and suggests an effective remedy as follows: """"The flood is on us once more. What used to be a very occasional annoyance is now established as a terrible annual visitation. Montreal is fast being known as a beautiful and prosperous city, but a city in which residence cannot be recommended, for a great part of our real estate is liable to be submerged on a few hours' notice. Now that we have waited, like good Montrealers, till the evil has reached its height, it behooves us to consider how it may best be prevented for the future. There is one remedy that is still untried. Theorists from Quebec and other places have pestered us with such medieval schemes as that of keeping our river open with tugs, something like facing a cyclone with a snow shovel. Government engineers have spent Government money in boring symmetrical rows of holes in the ice. Scientists in spectacles have covered manuscripts with theories as to the nature of frazil. While these and like ideas have been ventilated on the street, while the gentleman who wanted to blow up the Boucherville Islands has discussed with the gentleman who thought of building a boom across Lake St. Louis, the one simple and practical scheme has been kept in the background. This scheme was to build a dyke from Victoria Bridge to a point some two miles up the river, along the river bank. The dyke, being three feet higher than the highest floods, would effectually prevent any damage. It could be built in eight months, and thus be in time for the next flood. The scheme had one crowning defect in the eyes of a number of those who controlled the distribution of certain public assets. It would benefit property along the Lower Lachlue Road, and there would be no possible chance of """"boodle"""" in it. And thus, although every practical man has recognized what everyone says today, that this dyke is the only effectual remedy against the floods, it has remained untried, while the public ear has been open to every variety of chimeric and impracticable theory. It is time that this should cease. Our men of business are again losing heavily; our poorer fellow-citizens are again suffering untold misery; our fair city is falling into disrepute. Let us have a truce to discussion and theorizing and try the only practical measure of relief. THE RAILROAD WORLD, Work on the Duluth Line, and P. Inspection A Western Connection, Fully 600 men are now making the dirt fly on the Sault branch of the Duluth, South Shore & Atlantic, over a hundred Italians having been received from Buffalo this week, while the contractors are picking up all the men here that they can get. No trouble is being experienced from water, as some had feared, as the snow has been disappearing so gradually as not to cause anything of a flood in the lowlands there. All the work now is on construction all along the division, the right of way having been cut out from the junction to the Sault, and such good progress is being made that Mr. J.T. Cardinal, the president, in the chair. Many priests were present, amongst them Abbe Langlois, Fr. Blais, etc. After the reading of the minutes of the preceding meeting, the president introduced Mr. Archibald de Lery Macdonald, who read a very interesting paper on """"Le Major Closso,"""" one of the bravest lieutenants of De Maisonneuve in the founding of Montreal. He recited with great ability """"L'Adresse, La Bravoure, La Sagesse et Les Succès"""" of the brave major in the battle against the Iroquois. The director thanked the lecturer. The president then asked Mr. Rudolph Lemieux, of La Patrie, to give his commentary on """"La Vie et les Détours de la Politique."""" This was a very interesting description of the valleys of the Northwest, and included the relation of some very amusing incidents of the writer's tour in the Northwest country. As promised by him, Mr. Lemieux did not make any political allusions, and the president, in thanking the lecturer, referred to his delightful lecture, after which remarks the séance ended. A BROKEN TAIL often causes the death of a ruptured man, and is always cumbersome when unbroken. Sufferers from rupture, piles, varicocele, hydrocele, etc., should call on the members of the Kiln Medical and Surgical Association of Buffalo, N.Y. at the Albion Hotel. They cure these dangerous and painful affections by a new method of treatment. TO PREVENT THE FLOODS, The City Council has resolved on a Line of Action, THE FLOODS, His Worship stated that he had two matters to bring before the council, the one a letter received from the Department of Militia and Defence, relative to Logan's farm, and the other respecting the flood, which unfortunately had arisen. With regard to the latter, he said the insufficiency of blasting operations had been clearly demonstrated, and had also the fact that floods in Montreal were due to the premature breaking up of the upper ice. It had also been proved beyond the possibility of a doubt that the only way to prevent floods in the future was to retain the upper ice, by means of a boom, until the channel below was clear and a passage attained. This undoubtedly was a Government work, and as Parliament was now in session, no time should be lost, as if a grant were not made this session a grant next session would be too late to prevent a flood next year. LOGAN'S FARM PARK, The letter from the Department of Militia and Defence was then read, which set forth that by order-in-council, passed on the 20th April, the Government had divided Logan's farm into two parts, the one being reserved for a parade ground, the other having been leased to the city for a park for twenty-one years at a nominal rate of $100 per year, with right of rental for a further term of twenty-one years, provided the city expend upon it $5,000 per year for the first five years, and maintain the park to the satisfaction of the Minister of the Interior, the Government to be empowered to re-enter at any time, without recompense to the city, should the ground be required for Government purposes. Aid. J. Cukier, while disappointed that the whole plot had not been granted, said the thanks of the council were due to Aid. Laurent for his exertions in the matter. WITH REGARD TO THE FLOOD, if the advice of some old and experienced gentlemen h",
18860116,historical,flood,"THE RIVER FLOODS TO THE EDITOR OF THE GAZETTE, Sir, It is plain that a large portion of our city will be permanently injured or the floods must be stopped. It is plain that the public are not now in possession of any reliable information upon which to base calculations to fix the cost. While the floods are upon us everybody tries to stop them; but when they pass away things go on just as formerly and nothing is done. Your published interview with Mr. TO THE EDITOR OF THE GAZETTE, Sir, A great deal has been said on the cause of the floods with which so many are painfully familiar, the proper course to pursue, the parties to blame for the present state of affairs, and as to who should initiate and execute remedial measures. Ald. Donovan speaks of draining the St. Paul street district into the Craig street sewer. Possibly the accession of the aldermanic robe has imbued him with a clear idea as to how best the pellucid waters of the St. Paul street level could be induced to climb the intervening hill on which St. James and Notre Dame streets are situated, or does he contemplate the costly expedient of relaying the whole system (when only the point of drainage is at fault) and leading it round by McGill street? My suggestion is to leave the sewers alone, they perform their office, except on abnormal occasions, and merely to protect them and those who use them from the action of these floods. A suggestion very similar to this was made to the council by the City Surveyor in 1884, and with the council rests the blame of having taken no steps whatever towards remedying this well-known devastating evil. It is compulsory on the part of property owners to connect with the public sewage; they have no alternative. It is the business of the civic authorities to see that their system of drainage is perfect, and by making the connection compulsory they take upon themselves the obligation of holding the property owners harmless against all damages from without, over which they can have no control. The remedy of the property owner is by an action at law for damages resulting from acts of negligence, in the same way as such an action would lie against a gas company if a leak from the mains led to an explosion. You say truly, sir, that dry rot is in the City Hall. It is too thin, this posing as our worthy alderman, this fussiness as the beneficent creature dispensing the ratepayers' money amongst the sufferers from his neglect of public duties; it is so much claptrap to catch votes, to gain cheap popularity, to divert attention from the real issue. This had never occurred had he done his duty. That Common and Commissioners streets require to be bodily raised some twenty inches is clear to anyone. There is no element of great expense about it. It would inflict little or no damage to contiguous properties, and if the drainage were stopped off, as before suggested, they would be safe from all damage by flood, and probably property owners would be well disposed and better able to bear a small special assessment distributed over a period of years. The great shove takes place in the direction of the current, and this determines the move that piles up the ice near Jacques Cartier square, when the current strikes the shore. Now, by deepening the eastern branch of the river, as I suggested in the Gazette last year, from the bridge toward Longueuil, the impetuosity and dangers of St. Mary's current would be greatly lessened; the volume of water being the same, would, by being more evenly distributed, pass more slowly; and, in the same way, the ice would be divided in the pack, and would exercise its force more towards St. Helen's island, whilst the sectional area of deep water being great, would allow more adequate space for flow after making due allowance for choking up by frazil. With regard to the embankment for protecting low-lying districts, and confining the river in its proper bounds, I venture to say that $25,000 per mile never would pay for all that is required; the stone for the rough facing and the filling behind would all be in situ by placing the bank a little beyond the limits of summer water level.

Fairbairn as follows: The boom in wheat on the curb yesterday showed up at the opening this morning with outside buying orders not as plenty as expected. The offerings by the local crowd became liberal and the market declined half a cent, ruling steady for the first two hours when there came a flood of selling orders from the seaboard followed by the announcement that half a million of gold had been taken for shipment, causing a panic and a rush of all classes of holders to sell, breaking the market to $1.50 May. It rallied slowly to $1.52 and ruled steady around that. We see no sufficient cause for the sudden break today and think it likely to be recovered quickly. Pork very strong, corn inactive.

19980109,modern,rain,"THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 9, 1998 A3 THE BIG FREEZE Transportation falls victim to weather Freezing rain turns highways into rivers of slush and railway lines into sheets of ice AARON DERFEL The Gazette Most trains, planes and automobiles ground to a halt yesterday as the second ice storm in a week battered the Montreal region's transportation network. Freezing rain turned highways into rivers of slush and rail lines into sheets of ice. Many motorists chose to stay home rather than venture out in the treacherous weather. Major airlines canceled flights in and out of Montreal, bus trips were delayed by as much as 45 minutes and train service was disrupted. At Dorval Airport, hundreds of commuters sat forlornly in the food court for hours on end, waiting to catch one of the few flights out of the city. """"It's like Siberia out there!"""" Taline Kabadjian, 38, said as she picked at a half-eaten pastry. Kabadjian, who lives in Nice, flew to Montreal last week for a family visit. """"But I can't wait to go home,"""" she said, tears streaming down her cheeks. """"I've done nothing here but stay indoors and watch TV."""" Ben Yankson, 21, arrived at the airport from Calgary a day late and was lounging in the terminal for hours, hoping to be picked up by his girlfriend. """"The problem is I can't reach her by phone,"""" Yankson said. """"I don't know where she is and I'm hoping she'll come and get me. I'm a patient guy, but this is too much,"""" he added. The airlines canceled 255 flights in and out of Dorval, up from 200 on Wednesday even though the runways were clear. The ice storm forced Transport Quebec to close 30 highways for most of the day and 13 were still off-limits late last night. Montreal Island highways, however, remained open and work crews were busy de-icing them overnight. Via Rail canceled its train routes west of Toronto in both directions because of fallen debris on tracks. """"The bus drivers are being very careful on the road because of the icy conditions,"""" officials said they expected some lines would stay shut this morning. """"This is probably the first time that service from Toronto to the east coast has been canceled in a single day,"""" Via spokesman Malcolm Andrews said. Commuter-train service was also hampered. The Montreal-Rigaud line has been closed until further notice, while there will be no service between Dorion and Rigaud until Monday. The other commuter lines should run normally. West Island commuters who thought they'd get to work early yesterday morning by rushing for commuter train No. 10 had another think coming. After pulling into Beaconsfield station about 20 minutes late, the 7:42 a.m. Montreal-bound train ground to a halt one kilometer short of Dorval station, when live electrical wires were spotted on the track. As many as 400 passengers were then told to disembark and walk to Dorval, where they could board buses bound for the Lionel Groulx metro station. At the Montreal bus station, trips to New York and Boston were canceled, while passengers had to endure delays for up to 45 minutes on all other routes. """"The bus drivers are being very careful on the road because of the icy conditions,"""" bus terminal official Patricia Papineau said. The Montreal South Shore Transit Corp. cut 40 of its rush hour bus routes in the afternoon, leaving commuters with only the 21 major ones to get home. The transit system could no longer keep up after three days of blackouts at all three of its garages, which left only backup generators to provide power for lighting, vehicle-repair equipment and a few fuel pumps, communications director Raymond Allard said. The Sureté du Quebec reported fewer highway accidents than in normal weather conditions because most motorists chose to stay at home. """"The rush hour was quite calm,"""" Constable Francois Dore said. """"Fewer and fewer people are taking to the road and we expect that to continue today."""" Debbie Parkes and Claude Arpin of The Gazette contributed to this report. Storm bringing people together Kahnawake elders look on bright side LYNN MOORE The Gazette Gratitude for an ice storm that has walloped their region hard, knocking out power to about half a million South Shore residents, is about the last thing one might expect from residents. But Joe Deer, his wife, Josie Deer, and other elders of Kahnawake figure that the storm has provided a set of opportunities that might come once or twice a generation. """"It's getting the people back together and it reminds people of their relationship with other people,"""" Joe Deer told visitors to his Kahnawake home yesterday. An estimated 60 to 70 percent of Kahnawake's homes and businesses were without power yesterday afternoon. Evidence of the enduring storm was inescapable in the region. 200 COTS READY In Chateauguay, ice-laden trees partially blocked some riverside roads while Longueuil officials warned motorists, especially truck drivers, to avoid secondary roads and low-hanging, ice-laden power lines. Kahnawake's emergency shelter provided about 300 suppers last night and 200 cots were at the ready to serve as beds. """"We are prepared,"""" community-services committee member Rheena Diabo said. And word of the shelter had been spread. About 15,000 notices had been distributed, advising people of the shelter set up at the Knights of Columbus hall. Local radio station K103, using an emergency generator, alerted residents to news of the shelter and conservation officers had traveled in trucks and all-terrain vehicles to outlying homes, offering those residents a lift into town. But about 55 elderly or infirm people who had no power or heat refused to leave their homes, Diabo said. """"They grew up during the Depression and take this in stride,"""" she said. """"They are tough and they know what to do."""" They do have wood-burning stoves and light sources, Diabo added. And authorities or family members check on them regularly, she said. Deer, who is pushing 76 and breaks out the ceremonial tobacco when visitors arrive at his home, understands the stand taken by his contemporaries. So does Kellyann Meloche, who turns 23 next week, and uses computers, cellular telephones and fax machines in her job as coordinator of emergency planning for the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake. """"They (the community elders) have been through tough times. For them, this is not difficult. And they have wood stoves. Now everyone is gathering around the stoves in their homes and talking. They like it that their children and grandchildren can come and sit around the fire and talk about things,"""" Meloche explained. Among the items on Meloche's agenda yesterday were meetings with other emergency workers and council members to determine whether a state of emergency should be declared in Kahnawake. Another item was what the community's response would be to any possible offers of assistance from the Canadian Forces. It was a topic that Meloche approached gingerly yesterday. (During the 1990 Oka crisis, emotions ran high as armed Mohawks blocked the Mercier Bridge in solidarity with Mohawks in Kanesatake locked in a 78-day standoff against provincial police and the army.) """"These are certainly different circumstances,"""" Meloche said. """"I know that a lot of people have put '90 in the past. For instance, we have got cots (for Kahnawake's shelter) from the Red Cross and there was a time in '90 when it refused to come in here because they deemed Kahnawake a war zone. But now we are working with them."""" Damage from ice will be most costly GEOFF BAKER The Gazette A senior insurance official now says the ice storm that has ravaged southern Quebec this week will cost more to fix than any other winter weather disaster in Canadian history. """"I think this is definitely the worst storm where insurance was involved in terms of winter storms,"""" said Raymond Medza, general manager for the Quebec region of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. Medza said that from the initial reports he's been getting, the cost of storm damage should rise well into the tens of millions of dollars when his umbrella association, which counts about 140 insurers in Quebec, starts getting financial estimates from members next week. Costly winter storms are unusual, he said, since the biggest inconveniences are usually limited to traffic chaos and not physical damage. The insurance bureau began tracking storm costs after the July 14, 1987, flood in Montreal that resulted in payouts of about $70 million. Financial damage from storms before that would have trouble cracking today's Top-50 list because of inflation and Medza said none of the winter ones - including Montreal's so-called """"storm of the century"""" in March 1971 - come even close to what this week's will cost. """"I was in this same office I'm in now back in 1971 and I was stranded here for two days,"""" he said of the storm that dropped 47 centimeters of snow in Montreal on March 3 and 4 of that year. """"We actually had a pretty good time here. While the streets were blocked and you couldn't go anywhere, you didn't have power failures or tree branches crashing down on cars and homes."""" The most expensive winter storm recorded in Canada from an insurance perspective was a March 1991 tornado that tore through Sarnia, Ont., and caused $25 million worth of insurable damage. None of Montreal's previous ice storms made the insurance bureau's list of the most costly Canadian natural disasters. """"Two people who work with me had tree branches crash through their roofs,"""" Medza said the heaviest storm damage occurs during the summer months, when high winds can cause tornadoes and excessive rain brings sewer backups and floods homes. Of the 48 most costly Canadian storms, 31 of them occurred during the months of July and August. But it was on Sept. 7, 1991, that a severe hail storm rained down on the city of Calgary, causing $342 million in insurable damage to homes and cars - the highest total recorded by any natural disaster in Canada's history. Quebec's worst insurance bill was for $212 million after the July 1996 flooding in the Saguenay - although about $108 million of that total came from one company reporting three commercial-property claims.

The same weather system that has dumped more than 50 millimeters - and counting - of icy precipitation on southwestern Quebec this week has also wreaked havoc on eastern Ontario and several U.S. states. More than 200,000 Ontario Hydro customers in the areas of Ottawa, Kingston and Cornwall were left without power yesterday, and officials said it may be days before service is re-established. """"It's difficult to tell how long this is going to take, the weather is really working against us,"""" said Ontario Hydro spokesman Al Manchee. """"It could be a matter of hours for some and a matter of days for others."""" In Ottawa, more than 30,000 of the 110,000 Hydro customers in the city were without power yesterday morning, and the storm was again blamed for wiping out progress made earlier in the week. """"We're right back in the thick of things now,"""" Hydro spokesman Dan Ralph said. City officials declared a state of emergency, and Ralph said it will be at least another 24 hours before the damage is repaired. The weather and Ottawa airport delays have forced Prime Minister Jean Chretien and the provincial premiers to postpone from Saturday to Sunday their departure on a trade mission to Latin America. While storm-struck people in Ottawa and Montreal scramble to find flashlights and friends with electricity, people living in the surrounding countryside are facing other challenges, like helping their animals survive and dealing with isolation. At the Claire farmhouse in Vankleek Hill, Ont., the phone was ringing off the hook - just about the only appliance that is still working since the ice storm hit.

The Gazette, MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 9, 1998 A9 NATION Binnie named to Supreme Court STEPHEN BINDMAN Southam News OTTAWA - A highly respected but little-known Bay Street lawyer and constitutional expert is the newest member of the Supreme Court of Canada. But Prime Minister Jean Chretien's surprise appointment yesterday of Ian Binnie is being criticized as a missed opportunity to appoint another woman to the country's top court. """"It's absolutely mind-boggling,"""" said University of Calgary professor Kathleen Mahoney. """"Fifty percent of the people in Canada are women and there are so many good women on the bench that they can no longer justify just two women out of nine on the Supreme Court of Canada."""" University of Ottawa professor Ed Ratushny agreed that, while Binnie will make an excellent judge, several strong female judges on the Ontario Court of Appeal could have received the nod. Fifty-eight-year-old Binnie, a partner with the country's largest national law firm, McCarthy Tetrault, replaces Justice John Sopinka, who died suddenly late last year. He is Chretien's second appointment to the high court - New Brunswick Judge Michel Bastarache was appointed in October to replace retiring Gerard La Forest. Mild-mannered and publicity-shy, the Montreal-born, Cambridge-educated lawyer has represented a wide variety of clients during his 30-year legal career, ranging from large corporations to Guy Paul Morin, who was wrongfully convicted of killing his neighbor. Binnie is also no stranger to Ottawa, having spent four years as assistant deputy minister of Justice in the 1980s, responsible for all litigation by or against the federal government. He has appeared before the Supreme Court more than 25 times, arguing both for and against the federal government on issues ranging from gay rights to cruise-missile testing. He has represented the media in several important cases, including challenges to the publication ban in the Karla Homolka case and to a law that restricts the reporting of opinion polls in the days before federal elections. Binnie has extensive constitutional experience. Besides arguing numerous cases involving the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, he recently represented Newfoundland in its bid for constitutional reforms to its religious-based education system and was counsel to a Senate-Commons committee on the Meech Lake accord in the late 1980s. Chief Justice Antonio Lamer said Binnie will be sworn in Feb. 2 and will spend the following few weeks preparing for the hearings on Quebec's right to secede unilaterally, which will proceed as scheduled on Feb. 16. He said Binnie's appointment from private practice will help keep the court in touch with the society it serves. Chretien defended the appointment even though there are only two women on the top court - Claire L'Heureux-Dubé and Beverley McLachlin. He said Justice Minister Anne McLellan recommended a lawyer from private practice to replace Sopinka. """"It's not a question of numbers. We do not select based on sex and language and religion and color. We try to have the best person available,"""" said Chretien, who as justice minister appointed Bertha Wilson as the first woman on the top court. Ontario lawyer is called sharp, funny Binnie steps into late John Sopinka's shoes JIM BRONSKILL Southam News OTTAWA - The magazine article featured prominent lawyer John Sopinka, but the accompanying photograph was of colleague Ian Binnie. It was an easy mistake to make: the two legal eagles, with neatly trimmed mustaches and wide-rimmed glasses, looked strikingly similar. The 1988 mugshot mix-up eerily foreshadowed events to come. Binnie, appointed yesterday to the Supreme Court, fills the vacancy left by Sopinka's untimely November death. Both men made the rare leap from careers as practicing lawyers to the country's highest bench. And the similarities do not end there. Associates say Binnie possesses two of Sopinka's finest traits - the ability to distill complex arguments into simple language and a warm sense of humor. """"The late John Sopinka, in the opinion of most, is irreplaceable,"""" said Ottawa lawyer David Scott. """"But Ian is certainly a worthy successor, tragic as John's departure was."""" A constitutional expert, Binnie has handled cases on a wide range of subjects, including freedom of expression, pharmaceutical regulation, free trade, aboriginal issues and international boundaries. As a young man, Binnie's formidable intellect led him to England's Cambridge University, where he earned a law degree before returning to Canada to continue his studies. After establishing a track record in private practice, he served four years as associate deputy justice minister in the federal government. In 1986, he joined the law firm McCarthy Tetrault. Peter Russell, a law professor at the University of Toronto, said the Supreme Court will benefit from Binnie's solid experience in constitutional and international affairs. """"A lot of the court's most challenging work ahead lies in those fields."""" Binnie hinted that joining the court will not prevent him from occasionally wading into debates about how the law applies to current events. """"I certainly think that judges are accountable, because they exercise a lot of authority on matters that are important to individuals,"""" he said. """"I don't think they should be immune from criticism and I don't think that they should pretend that their views are of no importance and, therefore, not speak out."""" Binnie said he was """"astonished"""" when he was approached last month to see whether he would be a candidate. """"I had not applied for any judicial position and there was certainly no lobby,"""" he said. """"The process that produced it is something that I don't know about."""" He said, """"I've been to the Supreme Court often enough as a lawyer and it's going to be interesting to see it from the other side of the bench."""" Binnie said he is a fan of the Charter and is prepared to use it to strike down laws. """"I think when the Charter was brought, it was intended to be used constructively and creatively, and I think that's what the court has done. The elected legislators gave the courts the tools by which they have invalidated some laws."""" It's not as if the courts have usurped the power that the parliamentarians never intended to confer. """"I don't know that I can pigeonhole myself as a conservative or liberal or activist. I think those concepts are applied by others to judges when they see what kind of track record is developed. That will emerge over time."""" Binnie has four children with wife Susan, who works for the Law Society of Upper Canada. Daughter Alexandra is a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in England. Although he typically has a full legal plate, Binnie has made time for gardening, skiing and sailing. He is invariably described as kind and personable, but not to be taken lightly in the courtroom. A colleague remembers a 1992 boundary dispute with France in which Binnie, representing Ottawa, boiled down a confusing point into an amusing analogy about a joint bank account. The story not only clearly explained the point, but had the French lawyer and the judge in gales of laughter, recalls the associate. """"Not an easy thing to do. It's certainly one of the key features of his approach to difficult issues, to get at the essence of them and to express that in very simple, very matter-of-fact but very persuasive language."""" Binnie was often called in to rescue floundering cases on appeal - for example, last year he persuaded the Supreme Court to let three Nazi war-crimes cases proceed despite a secret meeting between a judge and a senior federal lawyer. """"He's one of the best lawyers in Canada and he's the kind of person we need on the Supreme Court of Canada,"""" said Osgoode Hall law professor Patrick Monahan. Scott sees Binnie intellectually as something of an iron fist in a velvet glove. """"One should not confuse his very gentle appearance and approach as any timidity or absence of focus or purpose,"""" he said. """"He knows exactly what he's doing.""""

DAVID SIDAWAY, GAZETTE Snap, crack, crash; Thousands of trees in parks across the island are succumbing to ice build-up and wind. Mount Royal ravaged People ignore danger to visit the 'beautiful' mountain MICHELLE IALONDE The Gazette Standing in a branch-littered clearing on Mount Royal yesterday afternoon and looking up at the ice-glazed trees was like watching fireworks in reverse: The silver explosions would start, static in the sky, then a terrible crack, and a spectacular crash to the ground. Dozens of people were on the mountain yesterday, despite a city directive that all city parks are closed because of the danger of falling trees and branches. Nowhere was the damage as heavy as on Mount Royal, because of its height and exposure to the wind. Parks department superintendent Jean-Jacques Linscourt estimated yesterday that a quarter of the trees in Mount Royal Park might have to be cut down because of the terrible damage caused by this week's ice storm. COULD LOSE ONE-QUARTER """"A visual estimation leads us to believe that we could lose 25 percent of the trees in Mount Royal Park,"""" parks department spokesman Edith Pariseau said, adding that the cost of the damage has yet to be tallied. She said the estimate was very rough and that parks officials were so busy dealing with emergencies yesterday that they could not take accurate stock of damage on the mountain. Mount Royal is a symbol of Montreal and one of its tourism jewels, with more than 3 million visitors a year. That kind of traffic, many of whom are skiers, mountain-bikers and hikers, makes the park's natural forest vulnerable at any time. But the trees on Mount Royal have taken the worst beating from the ice storm mainly because the mountain is 233 meters high, leaving the trees exposed to constant buffeting from the winds. Those winds were whipping up at about 4:30 yesterday afternoon as Armand Acedevo brought his two daughters, 4 and 9 years old, down from a careful walk on the mountain. """"I went in the clearings, where there were no trees above us. We just came to look at it, it's so beautiful,"""" Acedevo said. Mount Royal Park, along with the city's 715 other parks, was officially closed by decree of the city's emergency-measures committee yesterday. Pariseau said it's impossible to put fences up around all the parks, but police can order pedestrians out and the city accepts no responsibility for injuries caused by falling branches. A length of police tape, along with a more effective clump of fallen branches, blocked the path up from Park Ave, but that didn't stop dozens of mountain enthusiasts and their dogs from taking their chances among the falling timber yesterday. In fact, many of those hiking on the mountain in the afternoon had no idea the park was officially closed. Jason Cohen and Luc Lavoie emerged from a dense canopy of trees, cameras in hand. """"We are taking disaster shots; we took photos of the same trees last fall and they were so beautiful,"""" Cohen said. Sean McCutcheon was walking his two dogs on the mountain yesterday as he does every day. The crashing all around him did not seem to faze him, although one of his dogs was obviously skittish. CALCULATED RISK """"Nobody stops me. I come here every day. I love these trees. I love this forest,"""" he said. He said he had a couple of favorite old trees he wanted to check on, to see how they were doing, and was willing to take a """"calculated risk"""" to do that. He said he was being careful not to walk directly under the trees, and listened carefully for that telltale, warning crack. Paul Richardt, strolling with a companion as night fell on Mount Royal, said it was painful to see the trees breaking. """"There are emotions; it's not just trees. They are living things and it's hard to watch this, I find,"""" he said. About 20,000 of the city's trees have been damaged so far by the storm. Stadium readied for Stones Big O maintenance workers check roof, remove ice, snow KATHRYN GREENAWAY The Gazette Mick Jagger's throat isn't the only thing that needs to be clear if the Rolling Stones are going to play the Olympic Stadium Sunday night. A crew of around 30 Olympic Stadium maintenance workers has been visiting the roof on a daily basis to chip away any accumulated snow or ice. Down below, meanwhile, the stage set is ready and plans have been laid to remove snow and ice from the ramps, walkways, and entryways to the massive building. MEASURED FOR SAGGING Every day the tension of the cables holding up the stadium's roof is measured with a specially designed instrument to make sure no part of the roof is sagging under a dangerous strain. As of yesterday, all the cables registered well under the danger mark. """"It's hard to say how long (the cleanup process) will take because this is an exceptional situation which involves many variables,"""" Olympic Installations Board spokesman Francine Saucier said yesterday. """"We have to consider things like how strong the wind is blowing, how much more frozen rain is still on the way, or will the rain turn to snow?"""" None of the workmen were available for comment yesterday, but Saucier said they use nothing fancier than plastic shovels to get rid of ice on the roof. No chemicals, just shovels with edges rounded to prevent perforating the flexible roof. Is it dangerous work? """"Men are working on a slanted, flexible surface which is slippery with ice. So far things are going well,"""" Saucier said. Jagger, the Rolling Stones lead singer, canceled two shows this week - at Toronto's Skydome and in Syracuse, N.Y. The Old Brewery Mission is at 866-6591. A listing of food banks did not include the Share the Warmth Foundation, which operates a food bank in Point St. Charles, servicing Montreal's southwest sector Little Burgundy, Point St. Charles, St. Henri and Verdun. Phone 933-5599. As well, a single telephone number was given for the Gai Écoute and Gay Line listening services. Although the two lines share a phone-message system, each service has its own number. Gay Line, for English-speaking callers, is at 866-5090. Gai Écoute, for French-speaking callers, is at 521-1508.

20001106,modern,rain,"Residents of rain-weary Cape Breton will have to wait a few more days before the province determines if flooded basements and businesses qualify for financial assistance. Jamie Muir, the minister responsible for emergency measures, took a first-hand look yesterday at some of the areas hardest hit when a month's worth of rain soaked the island last week. After a tour that included collapsed culverts on the outskirts of Sydney, a heavily damaged basement in the town of Dominion, and a swamped store in Glace Bay, the minister said it will take days to place a dollar figure on the damage. """"We've seen damage in all areas,"""" said Muir, a Truro resident who experienced the massive flooding that took place there a few years ago. Muir said there was a """"significant amount of damage,"""" but didn't speculate on the total cost. """"Each case is different,"""" he said. MUST TALLY DAMAGE While the province has a disaster-relief plan, Muir said individual homeowners will have to tally the damage and apply for assistance. The policy, which carries a $1,000 deductible, covers uninsurable damage to homes and small businesses up to $50,000. The overall damage must also trigger a national relief policy before the provincial plan kicks in. In Nova Scotia, that means roughly one dollar per capita, or $942,000, worth of damage must be incurred in any area of the province before relief is offered. """"There are a number of factors and it doesn't take a long while to straighten out once things dry out,"""" he said. """"But until the water goes down and people get things dried out, it's pretty difficult to make an assessment."""" BRIDGE REPLACED Muir added that the province is already footing the bill for repairs to a culvert eaten away by a rushing brook in the Floral Heights subdivision near Sydney. Yesterday, crews replaced a walking bridge that was the only way in or out for about 150 families, with a 26-metre span. The new bridge was expected to be operating after midnight, emergency measures spokesman Debbie Rudderham said. Weather forecasters weren't offering any immediate relief from the wet weather. The same three low-pressure systems that drenched the industrial Cape Breton area with nearly 200 millimetres of rain between Oct. 28 and Thursday continued. An additional 33 millimetres fell Thursday, seven millimetres Friday and 52 millimetres Saturday. Between 5 and 10 millimetres were expected yesterday. Environment Canada meteorologist Mike Battson said no more heavy rainfall was in the forecast, but the system will continue to provide regular amounts of rain (from five to 20 millimetres) until mid-week. Woman shoved into path of train EDMONTON - A 22-year-old woman was shoved into the path of an approaching transit train yesterday but escaped death when the train was able to stop without hitting her. The train came so close to the woman that its front coupling cast a shadow over her, police said. """"She was very shaken up, obviously,"""" said Staff Sgt. Dick Shantz of Edmonton police. The woman suffered cuts and bruises and was undergoing X-rays to determine if she broke any bones in her 1.5-metre fall from the transit platform to the train tracks. Shantz said the attack occurred when a man """"ran up behind the woman and deliberately pushed her in front of the train"""" at a transit station at the University of Alberta about 4 p.m. An eyewitness tackled a suspect and held him until security arrived. Gordon Bernard Merrick, 38, of Edmonton is charged with attempted murder. THE ACES ON BRIDGE BY BOBBY WOLFF """"With foxes we must play the fox."""" -Thomas Fuller, M.

Kiwis dominate rugby Crush Wales to capture group in League World Cup Associated Press LONDON - Canberra winger Lesley Vainikolo scored three of New Zealand's 11 tries in a 58-18 Rugby League World Cup crushing of Wales in the Millennium Stadium yesterday. Halfbacks Stacey Jones and Henry Paul repeatedly unlocked the Welsh defence and the powerfully built Vainikolo terrorized them with his fast bursts in the style of All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu. The result maintained the Kiwis' expected perfect record with three wins from three group games in the competition as all three powerhouse teams made it to the quarter-final.

Cricket scandal sparks denials West Indies great Lara says he wasn't involved in fixing matches Associated Press PERTH, Australia - The West Indies cricket team closed ranks around an embattled Brian Lara as the visitors arrived in Australia for the start of a four-month tour. Lara, 31, together with six former international cricket captains, has been accused of match-fixing in a report released last week by India's Central Bureau of Investigation. Based predominantly on the testimony of an admitted illegal gambler, Mukesh Gupta, the report alleges that Lara took $40,000 to """"underperform"""" during two 1994 matches in India. The champion batsman, who has denied Gupta's claims, dodged the media on arrival in Perth. English not so Swede about Eriksson hiring """"It was as if Canada appointed a Finn to coach its national hockey team."""" When the English Football Association announced that it was hiring Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson, who has had great success coaching in Italy and Portugal, as its new national team coach, the outcry was tremendous. """"Disaster,"""" the tabloid London Daily Mirror headlined the news. """"England's humiliation knows no end. All that is left is for the football men of England to pull the sackcloth up over our heads and let the grave-dancers pile on the ashes,"""" wrote Daily Mail columnist Jeff Powell. """"We've sold our birthright down the river to a nation of 7 million skiers and hammer-throwers who spend half their lives in darkness."""" John Sadler of the Sun, a newspaper that has a well-deserved reputation for xenophobia, used words like """"humiliation"""" and """"climb-down"""" to describe the appointment. """"What a terrible, pathetic self-inflicted indictment,"""" he wrote. """"What an awful mess."""" Predictably, Gordon Taylor, a former manager who heads the Professional Footballers' Association, the players' union, and John Barnwell, head of the League Managers' Association, also condemned the move. """"I think it's a betrayal of our coaching structure,"""" Taylor said. """"When they talk about we've nobody here, suddenly Terry Venables is not considered, because they have put criteria down that maybe the Archbishop of Canterbury wouldn't meet."""" That might be the only time you'll see Venables, the former England manager whose shady financial dealings have landed him in frequent legal hot water, and the good archbishop linked in the same sentence. """"The appointment of a foreign coach beggars belief,"""" Barnwell said. """"This is another example of us giving away another of our family treasures to Europe."""" Then there was Jack Charlton, the former England player who was a mainstay on the World Cup-winning team in 1966, and a longtime manager in England and Ireland. """"The French are managed by a Frenchman, the Germans have a German in charge and the Italians have one of their own,"""" said Charlton, failing to note one key difference between those countries and England - they've had vastly greater international soccer success. And besides, I seem to remember that Charlton, an Englishman, was the Irish soccer manager for several years in the 1980s and '90s. """"What's sauce for the goose?"""" It was Paul Hayward of the London Daily Telegraph who put matters into the proper perspective when he wrote: """"Only if we keep repeating the discredited mantra that England is a great footballing power will Eriksson's appointment continue to be seen as an outrage."""" FOREIGNERS IN - Many Italian players and coaches, not least national team coach Giovanni Trapattoni, are advocates of strict limits on foreign players, even ones from other European Union countries, on Italian league teams. They feel that the use of too many foreign players hinders the development of Italians. However, a verdict last week in a court case will certainly open the door to even more foreign influence in Italy. The ruling said it was illegal for Italian teams to differentiate between EU players, which can be used in unlimited numbers, and players from the rest of the world. Current rules say teams can sign only five non-EU players and only three can be on the field at one time. The ruling, in a case brought by the delightfully named Nigerian Ikpe Prince Ekong, applies only to Serie C, the Italian minor leagues, but is virtually certain to be applied to Serie A and B. In fact, AC Milan and its five non-EU players - Brazilians Dida, Serginho and Roque Junior, Ukrainian Andriy Shevchenko and Croatian Zvonimir Boban - fired off a letter to the Italian soccer federation after the verdict was announced, threatening its own legal action unless it is allowed to use all five foreign players at any time. Lazio also sent a letter threatening its own court challenge. Team owners love the verdict - increased competition will keep wages down - but Italian players were dismayed. """"If this ruling goes through, it would be absolutely crazy,"""" said Parma's Diego Fuser. """"This will help neither Italian football nor foreigners. With an entirely free market there will be no reason for clubs to invest in the youth sector."""" MARRIAGE MADE IN MERCHANDISING HELL - It was only a matter of time before Moneybags United - oops, that should be Merchandise United, no, sorry, Manchester United - got together with sportswear colossus Nike. The English kingpin signed a deal last week with the American company to supply its uniforms and kit, beginning in August 2002. That's when United's deal with England's Umbro runs out. The 13-year deal is worth up to an astounding $670 million Canadian. That eclipses the record deal between Nike and the Brazilian national team, worth a paltry $140 million over 10 years. The deal came into effect despite protests by some members of Shareholders United, the fans' pressure group, which was alarmed at reports of exploitation and child labour at some third-world Nike factories. Man U made the usual noises about watching the situation carefully, safeguards in place, yadda yadda yadda. In this case, money doesn't just talk, it screams. BLATTER BABBLE - An impressive climb-down by Sepp Blatter, the cement-skulled FIFA president. Blatter, alarmed at the Brazilian congress's investigation into soccer in that country, threatened to bar Brazil from international play, citing political interference. Brazilians reacted with outrage, suggesting that Blatter should welcome efforts to clean up Brazilian soccer, a notorious quagmire of corruption. Politicians suggested that the FIFA boss was badly informed and should go away and think again. Blatter quickly fired off a conciliatory email saying he now supported the congressional probe, as long as it confines its investigation to Brazilian soccer, which was the plan all along. SHORT PASSES - Free-spending Chelsea of England's Premier League has signed Danish midfielder Jesper Gronjaer from Ajax Amsterdam for almost $20 million. Guess those rumours of abolishing transfer fees aren't worrying the Blues. Astonishingly, the Football Association of Ireland says it is satisfied that Tony Cascarino was always eligible to play for Ireland, this despite the admission by Cascarino, who won a record 88 caps for Ireland, that he has no Irish blood. His mother, whose maiden name was O'Malley, actually was adopted, Cascarino wrote in his autobiography. Ireland actually does have a regulation that allows offspring of children adopted by Irish parents to assume Irish citizenship. Claudio Lopez, the striker expensively signed by Italy's Lazio from Valencia of Spain, will be out up to three months after tearing the outside ligament in his left knee in a game last week.

The divers were able to penetrate one metre into the fourth compartment, and visibility was poor, navy spokesman Vladimir Navrotsky said. So far they have not found any bodies. The work is very difficult because of the damage. The Kursk, with a crew of 118, exploded and sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea on Aug. 12. A preliminary inspection of the fourth compartment with video cameras showed extensive damage to the partitions between the living and service areas, but the wall dividing it from the third compartment remained intact, Navrotsky said. On Saturday, divers moved their search for bodies toward less damaged areas after failing to enter a shattered third forward compartment earlier in the week. So far, only 12 bodies have been recovered. What's Up? Young people in politics Appearing on November 9.

""""He is one of the good ones. But it will be hard for him. He's all by himself now,"""" the 59-year-old plumber offered sadly. Bachand is the last Tory member of Parliament in Quebec and the only one of the five Quebec Tories elected in 1997 not to quit to join another party. With almost no help from the once-mighty, now foundering Conservatives, the popular former mayor of Asbestos is in a fight for survival with Bloc Quebecois candidate Andre Bellavance - who is working hard to reclaim the seat the separatist party lost three years ago.

19980124,modern,rain,"16-PAGE SPECIAL SIM SECTION Looking back on days of freezing rain and chaos: the stories of people caught in the tempest MONTREAL SINCE 1778 SPORTS FINAL JANUARY 24, 1998 $1 Weather expert Pommainville is one of the lucky. Power was restored to his home on Tuesday afternoon, even before he left the office. His house is warm and bright. Some of his colleagues, by contrast, have turned into surprised refugees. Worried employees huddle for a smoke in the lobby of the St. Laurent building. They expected dramatic weather. But they never anticipated weather powerful enough to snap Hydro pylons like chicken bones. The meteorologists are scrambling to keep up with the demand. As well as their regular forecasts to the general public, the media and the region's airports, they are now providing special forecasts to Hydro-Quebec. They also begin to make regular calls to the premier's office. By 11:17 a.m., the outlook has changed. It now seems clear that Wednesday will bring relatively little freezing rain to southern Quebec. Still, the new bulletin warns: A more important system will affect most regions tonight and Thursday. It will give important additional quantities of freezing rain. Bombardier Eric Steinkey brushes up THE ICE STORM OF '98 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY Rene Levesque Blvd, near Bleury St, on ties of freezing rain. Like Cassandra in the Trojan War, the weather forecasters can predict the ravaging future. But they're powerless to change it. Hydro launches a massive de-icing and repair operation of its distribution network. More than 770 crews, including those from private companies, are sent out to remove branches from lines and to chip ice away from wooden electricity poles that are still standing. The work proves frustrating to many linemen: ice-glazed branches continue falling on lines that have just been repaired. """"It's going to take a lot more than 24 hours to fix this,"""" Millette says. """"We need additional manpower."""" Millette calls Ontario Hydro, but that utility has run into the same problems in the Ottawa region and can't afford to send linemen to Quebec. He tries utilities south of the border and manages to recruit some crews. On Montreal Island, the number of disrupted lines has dropped to 100. At the police operations centre, the crisis committee has continued to survey the situation on the island and to develop a series of contingency plans in the event the blackouts are complicated by other problems. Because nearly all of the island has gone dark, the committee is authorized by police chief Jacques Duchesneau to declare a state of emergency. The Police Brotherhood is called and told that as per the collective agreement, management now has the power to change schedules, cancel vacations, and call in officers on any form of leave - even medical. A telephone network that transmits orders to all of the department's 4,100 officers is activated and off-duty personnel scrambling with the rest of the public for candles and batteries are told to report for work. There is surprise and some worry on the part of the rank and file, particularly when it comes to leaving their homes in the middle of a disaster that does not distinguish between those in uniform and those out of it. But this reaction is not entirely unexpected; after all, the MUCPD has not been completely mobilized since 1971, when a strike by Montreal firefighters left the city under the threat of being burned to the ground. The crisis committee orders all stations able to function to do so on a 24-hour basis until further notice. Meanwhile, Montreal's downtown continues to cast a pale glow on the rain clouds that hang but a few hundred feet above it, and a veteran police constable named John Parker looks around him at the lights flickering on the storefronts on Ste. Catherine St. He will recall later that if there was a feeling that existed at the moment in the neighbourhood, it was that nothing could possibly go wrong here in the city core.

Canceling flights can lead to penalties TRAVELING RIGHTS PAUL UNTERBERG Many airlines, even charter airlines, are being pretty lenient with Quebecers who had to cancel or change their travel plans because they were too busy chipping ice off their cold, dark homes to catch the plane. Most are letting their passengers re-book without penalty, but the chaos of the last couple of weeks makes this a good time to review what your rights as a traveler are, as opposed to what the airlines are willing to do for you as a goodwill gesture. To know who is entitled to what, we must first examine the kind of contract and the type of product. A full-fare airline ticket on a regularly scheduled carrier is almost always fully reimbursable. APEX tickets or any other reduced fare tickets might have a cancellation or change-of-date penalty, but it's usually not very much. SEVERE RESTRICTIONS Charter flights and packages are very different. In exchange for a lower price, severe restrictions apply. These may, in cancellation cases, equal the total purchase price. Such severe penalties are valid on the condition that the traveler was made aware of them when he bought the ticket or package. These penalties are applicable against the traveler even though he has the world's best reasons for canceling - a death in the family, job loss, freezing rain and an icy home or other acts of God. Those who were prudent enough to have bought cancellation insurance will be happy to know that many (but not all) such policies have a clause allowing cancellation and the collection of a refund if the insured's principal residence becomes uninhabitable. Read your policy carefully and if necessary call your insurance agent for info. Don't forget that there may be delays you have to respect. VACATIONS CUT SHORT What about people, happy in the sunny south, who had to cut short their vacations because their home in the black triangle is without heat and light? The same principles apply. Package contracts have a clause stating that unused portions are not reimbursable. Such clauses are valid. Often cancellation-insurance policies have a clause covering trip interruption for things like the principal residence becoming uninhabitable. This might cover return airline tickets and perhaps even reimbursement of the unused portion of the package. Read your policy carefully. When you buy a package or a cheap ticket, you have to keep in mind that any cancellation penalties mentioned in the contract are legal and valid regardless of the reasons for canceling. That's why cancellation insurance is so useful. Such policies don't cover everything, but they often help.

Mount Royal was still off-limits yesterday as tree-pruners sawed off dangling branches in the midst of a snowstorm. The parking lot near the chalet and small refuges or other places where animals might be suffering. This is not the SPCA, Bercovici said. She is just an incredible lady who loves animals. More help is on the way. The mission is sending bunk beds to house volunteers. And a foundation that helps poor people is trying to start a government program to pay welfare recipients to work at the refuge. The area was filled with thousands of branches, stacked in piles as high as 10 feet. The Parks Department estimates that about 160,000 trees were damaged by the ice storm this month. At least 2,000 were destroyed. Those figures don't include the damage to wooded areas. In the next three months, city crews plan to carry out an exhaustive inventory of the damage in all parks and streets. In total, Montreal has about 445,000 trees in public spaces. City officials were unable to give the number of trees damaged on Mount Royal. But Peter Howlett, president of Les Amies de la Montagne, said that 75 per cent of the park's 200,000 trees suffered minor to severe damage. About 35 per cent of them, or 70,000, were destroyed, he estimated. Freezing rain had coated branches with ice up to 2 inches thick, causing them to snap. The trunks of some trees even split in two. """"It's light-years beyond any stress, any damage, any experience that natural areas such as this have ever been exposed to in our lifetimes,"""" he said. """"It is only obvious to realize that it is completely beyond the responsibility of the city services alone to take care of this. The community has to step up. It's going to take a lot of collaboration from the public to make this work."""" OTTAWA - The city of Ottawa will look for ways to replace or restore thousands of trees damaged by this month's ice storm. """"One of my duties is to protect and preserve Ottawa's natural legacy,"""" Mayor Jim Watson said yesterday. """"The ice storm has put that legacy at risk and steps must be taken immediately to ensure that future generations will know a green and healthy Ottawa."""" Watson announced the creation of the Atkinson Fellowship in Public Policy, now entering its eleventh year, is an award designed to further the tradition of liberal journalism and commitment to social and economic justice fostered by Joseph E. Atkinson, former publisher of The Toronto Star. It will be awarded to a full-time journalist for a one-year research project on a topical public policy issue, culminating in the publication of results in a series of articles, which the journalist is then free to develop into a book. The Fellowship includes a stipend of $65,000. As well, a budget for research expenses up to $25,000 is also available. The research year begins September 1, 1998. Application forms will be available January 17. The closing date for entries is March 13, 1998. Sponsored by The Atkinson Charitable Foundation, The Toronto Star and the Beland Honderich Family. For Application Forms: Christine Avery Nunez, Coordinator Atkinson Fellowship Committee, One Yonge Street, Fifth Floor, Toronto, Ontario M5E 1P9 Telephone inquiries (416) 368-5152. To that end, Les Amies will launch a fundraising drive next week to restore Mount Royal's flora, Howlett said. The group also plans to organize a cleanup after the park is reopened. The city hopes to reopen sections of Mount Royal - Beaver Lake, the Belvedere along Camillien Houde Way and the chalet - by next Saturday. Among the districts that were hardest hit are St. Henri, Point St. Charles and Ville Emard (94 per cent of the trees were damaged); Notre Dame de Grace and Cote des Neiges (89 per cent); and Rosemont and Petite-Patrie (77 per cent). COST UNKNOWN Claude Jean Lapointe, commissioner of the Scouts du Montreal Metropolitain, said his troops will continue volunteering after the Angrignon Park cleanup. """"It's all part of our values; games, teamwork and nature,"""" Lapointe said. """"During the ice storms, some of the older Scouts helped out at some seniors' residences. After the freezing rain, we have to concentrate on the cleanup and we will be involved until it's all over,"""" Bourque said he doesn't know what it will cost to repair and replant the trees, but Quebec will foot part of the bill under its disaster-relief program. A task force of environmental and community representatives to look at the options available to replace and maintain the city's trees. A preliminary survey indicates that 45,000 of the city's 60,000 on-street trees suffered significant damage. It is estimated that 6,000 of those trees will have to be cut down because of the severe damage they suffered. It could cost millions to replace those trees, the city said in a statement as it announced a fundraising campaign to help pay for tree replanting. Andre Martineau is jolted out of bed when the phone rings. It's the overnight foreman at Hydro-Quebec. He's to report to work. Now. All hell is breaking loose. Freezing rain is still pounding on the windows of his Laval West bungalow as he dresses. It's pitch black, the street lights are out in places and the roads to the west sector's offices on Henri Bourassa Blvd are a sheet of ice. The morning shift isn't scheduled to start until 7 a.m., but there are dozens of teams already at their trucks when Martineau, 38, gets in. Others are still awaiting work orders. There are power outages all over the place. Wires down everywhere. Where to start? Fellow lineman Bernard Dagenais doesn't stumble in until after 8 a.m. He'd gotten a middle-of-the-night call, too. But he's been off on Christmas holidays and this is no way to get back in the groove. So the 17-year Hydro veteran rolled over and went back to sleep. But there's no avoiding this ice storm. It hits him like a ton of bricks. Schools across the island have canceled classes. His daughters, 6 and 8 years old, are romping around the house, celebrating. Ice and snow blanket the trees on Mount Royal around the Women's Pavilion of the Royal Victoria Hospital on THE ICE STORM OF '98. His wife books off work. By midday, Dagenais has climbed a dozen trees and dragged hundreds of ice-laden branches and downed wires from the middle of streets across Hampstead, LaSalle and Pointe Claire. It's gray and gloomy and the freezing rain still hasn't let up. He's getting pretty dexterous with the chainsaw. But it's impossible to keep dry, even with the big raincoat he wears over his Hydro Quebec parka. Behind the wheel of his Mazda, Millette glimpses signs of the devastation: ice-laden branches crashing to the ground, high-voltage transmission towers buckling under the weight of thick ice and loose wires dangling in the wind. In Montreal, Millette alerts Quebec's civil-protection authorities. """"We have to mobilize our resources,"""" he says over the phone. """"We don't know how long the freezing rain is going to last."""" THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY JANUARY 24, 1998. On the 16th floor of a downtown office tower, Millette and his team work the phones all day long, dispatching linemen from across Quebec to the stricken areas. But the number of blacked-out homes and businesses keeps rising. The forecast was right, but Pommainville's home in Laval is still bright and warm when he leaves for work under a starless sky. His children can sleep late; their classes have been canceled. Soon after the scientist reaches the office, his house goes dark. The atmosphere in the Environment Canada office is tense. Pommainville and his colleagues sense that an exceptional weather event is underway. But the more unusual the event, the greater the pressure to come up with an accurate forecast. Their work, as a result, is not only scientific; it's also linguistic. If their words seem exaggerated, the forecasters will be criticized. But if the words appear to minimize a problem, the forecasters will come under equal attack. On the fifth floor of Montreal Urban Community police headquarters on Bonsecours St, in Old Montreal, about a dozen police officers file into a warehouse-like room filled with computers, electronic monitors and banks of telephones. The group consists of representatives of the MUCPD's planning, logistics and emergency-measures departments. Telephone hook-ups have been established with Hydro-Quebec and local fire departments. Two hours earlier, Hydro-Quebec had warned that its power-distribution system in Montreal - as well as that serving southwestern Quebec - was in imminent danger of collapse in a freezing rain storm. Reports are already coming in from two dozen precincts on the western side of Montreal Island that power has been lost and whatever traffic hasn't skidded off the road is beginning to tangle. But the police high command is hearing a different story from its precincts in the east end. Power is being maintained, and while the roads are slick, no one is hitting the panic button. One senior officer will later recall that the gist of the message sent from the east side of St. Laurent is that """"this is not the first time we've had freezing rain."""" The downtown core remains lit. The media are concentrating on the devastation wrought by the freezing rain on the South Shore, but Montreal, while battered, has not broken down. The operations centre monitors the situation until midnight, then closes. By now, more than 800,000 Hydro customers in the Monteregie, Laurentians and Montreal Island are without power. Near Drummondville, a high-voltage line collapses, blocking Highway 20. The weather bulletin this evening tries to give a ray of hope: """"The south of Quebec will experience a respite Wednesday, Jan. 7, this evening and tonight, as very little freezing rain is predicted."""" But, the bulletin continues, """"Another disturbance coming from the Great Lakes will give the south of Quebec more sustained freezing rain on Wednesday."""" A day earlier, 9 millimetres of freezing rain had fallen on Montreal - more than the usual amount for the whole of January. Today, the total will be 15.6. Tree branches are starting to buckle. People are starting to flee their homes. In the evening, when he leaves the parking lot outside his office, forecaster Pommainville has to scrape a thick layer of ice off his car. DAY 4 THURSDAY, JAN. 8 GAZETTE: Here comes Round 2 LAPRESSE: Encore du verglas LE JOURNAL: Un courant de solidarité LE DEVOIR: La météo fait craindre le pire. The precipitation ends, but not before dumping another load of freezing rain over parts of southwestern Quebec, creating even more havoc. As the crisis deepens, Premier Bouchard accepts an offer from the Canadian government to send in the army. The first 2,500 soldiers arrive at night from CFB Valcartier near Quebec City. They are joined by more than 800 tree-trim and line-repair workers from the northeastern U.S. It warns, """"will give many types of precipitation to the above regions into the night, and again on Friday."""" In the Montreal region, a mixture of freezing rain and ice pellets will persist until tonight and will resume on Friday after a brief period of calm. The forecast would prove correct, up to a point. Even so, it seems clear in retrospect that Thursday is the day when Montreal dodges a bullet. Over a 24-hour period, Montreal receives only 2.8 mm of freezing rain. In Ottawa, by contrast, the total is 19.6; in Saint-Hubert, 22.7. These totals are preliminary. Among the minor effects of the freezing rain is its ability to clog the sensors of the meteorologists' machines. MORNING The temperature in the Goral home has dropped like a stone overnight. THE ICE STORM OF '98. They get Marilyn Monroe, We get Mother Nature. Weaker wood pylons are only temporary. HYDRO Continued from Page A1. There were 6 kilometres of line left to connect before the Saint-Cesaire substation can be restarted, said Hydro spokesman Jean-Claude Lefebvre. Saint-Cesaire's intricate network of wires, pylons and transformers act as power brokers, breaking down the electricity that snakes into Saint-Cesaire along 230-kilovolt lines from a Boucherville station into the more manageable voltage of 120 kv. The 120-kv lines from Saint-Cesaire then supply the neighbourhood. Saint-Cesaire is dually important, Cliche said, because while it provides electricity straight to the Saint-Cesaire area, it also sends 230-kv lines out into wide swaths of the Monteregie, to be further broken down and then shipped to neighbourhood transformers. While freezing rain in the first days of the storm took a toll on lines leaving Saint-Cesaire, Cliche said, the real catastrophe for Saint-Cesaire came with the last dump of ice, which came Jan. 9. The final day of the ice storm killed Saint-Cesaire's power supply, which comes down from Manicouagan along 735-kv wires before passing through the Boucherville station, where its voltage is stepped down to 230 kv. Under normal circumstances, the work of repairing the lines from Boucherville down through the Monteregie and across the Richelieu River to Saint-Cesaire would take between three and four months, Cliche said. To complete the task in under three weeks, Hydro has had to do more than just import skilled help from south of the border. Wooden rather than metal pylons are being used to hold up the lines because they are faster to build. """"Normally, this would not conform with Hydro standards,"""" Cliche said. """"Right now, we will use wood, and then later we will replace them."""" Compromising standards also means compromising reliability, Cliche admitted readily. """"What will the performance be? We can't assure people it will be 100 per cent."""" """"Thunder is an enemy, wind is an enemy. Today we have wind,"""" Yvan Cliche said. The odds of major blackouts because of the new system's relative flimsiness """"can be reduced if people reduce their consumption of power,"""" he said. Mild weather would also help, he said. """"It's like a hockey player with an injury - you send him back out there and you see if he can stand it."""" For now, reconnecting the lines is like sewing, but with heavy wires rather than thread. The linemen are slowly pulling the wire through the pylons - some newly constructed out of wood to replace fallen metal ones - to link Boucherville and Saint-Cesaire. Atop the last pylon, across the road from the station, two linemen spent hours in the blizzard yesterday getting connections ready for the final pull. The wires feeding into the last pylon are hooked to a pulley system, which is controlled by a tractor on the ground. When it's time, the tractor will pull the whole Boucherville-Saint-Cesaire connection taut, and """"juice,"""" as the Hydro workers call it, will return to the triangle of darkness. It won't happen all at once, Cliche cautioned. Power will be reclaimed by Saint-Cesaire's control centre very slowly to make sure the equipment, which has been frozen and out of use for two weeks, can handle the flow. It will also be phased into the distribution system to avoid trying to warm up tens of thousands of freezing households all at once - a sure way to get another good power failure going, Cliche said. Even once the power is on full blast, between 60,000 and 70,000 Quebecers will probably still be in the cold because their distribution network is damaged, Hydro cautioned this week. But with the energy flowing, Hydro will have an easier time pinpointing local problems and fixing them, according to spokesmen. While Saint-Cesaire was still waiting for juice yesterday, the station itself was ready to go, chief Leo Quenneville said. It wasn't badly damaged by the ice, and workers were just fine-tuning operations yesterday. Hopefully, they'll get around to the light-bulb in the downstairs station bathroom. It seems to be out. IRWIN BLOCK OF THE GAZETTE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS REPORT Clinton plans public response TAPE Continued from Page A1. Lewinsky's deposition scheduled for today before lawyers in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment civil suit against Clinton, 52, was postponed indefinitely. Lewinsky's lawyer suggested she is in no condition to be making public appearances or precipitous choices on her legal options. """"She is devastated, concerned, upset and fearful,"""" said Ginsburg, adding that Lewinsky was in hiding with her mother. """"She does not know what the future holds."""" Lewinsky's options are constrained by a signed affidavit stating she did not have a sexual relationship with Clinton. Starr, a special prosecutor, is also restricting her choices by threatening to indict her if she does not cooperate with his investigation of Clinton. If Lewinsky stands by her affidavit, then she would also be admitting to inventing her allegations of an affair with Clinton, allegations captured in secretly recorded audiotapes of conversations with her co-worker Linda Tripp. Lewinsky's options include showing up for a deposition in the Jones sexual-harassment suit and using the Fifth Amendment to refuse to testify on the grounds that her answers may be self-incriminating. She could also choose to testify as a prosecution witness before a grand jury, but that would only happen if she is granted immunity from prosecution, her lawyer said. That could be lethal to Clinton's presidency, but any testimony would be vulnerable to attack by the president's lawyers. Transcripts of taped conversations posted on a Newsweek magazine Web site suggest Lewinsky cast doubt on her own credibility. """"I have lied my entire life,"""" she is reported to have told Tripp, according to the transcript. A Los Angeles Times source who listened to some of the tapes yesterday told the newspaper that Lewinsky said Clinton frequently telephoned her at home late at night, engaged in telephone sex with her and eventually devastated her emotionally by becoming involved with several other women. The source said Lewinsky is heard saying that she engaged only in oral sex with the president, and that Clinton told her he did not consider such an act to constitute a sexual affair. Yesterday, Clinton's press secretary, Mike McCurry, said the president feels """"empathy"""" for Lewinsky and hopes to publicly explain his relationship with her before his State of the Union address Tuesday night. McCurry said presidential lawyers and aides are working to assemble the information that Clinton needs to explain his relationship with the San Francisco native and to answer any follow-up questions that might arise. McCurry said Clinton would """"be better off"""" if he could address the nation prior to the State of the Union address and a trip the next day to Illinois and Wisconsin. White House officials said Clinton is weighing a variety of nationally televised formats to try to clear the air. A storm is approaching southwestern Quebec. The precipitation associated with this system will begin in the form of rain mixed with ice pellets, which will eventually change into freezing rain. The message goes out to the usual clients: radio and TV stations, airports, police. Gosselin glances up at one of the maps of Quebec that adorn the walls of the big, open-plan office. Soon, people all over the province will wake up to the forecast of what the heavens have in store for them. But no one - not even Gosselin - has any idea how catastrophic that low-pressure system will prove to be. DAY 1 MONDAY, JAN. 5 DAY 1 of the Great Ice Storm of '98 - and the first day back at work from the holidays for hundreds of thousands of workers in southwestern Quebec. It begins innocently enough - with freezing rain and the predictable morning traffic chaos. """"A nightmare,"""" says one radio traffic reporter. But the real nightmare is only beginning. Road crews are out all day salting and sanding, and the streets and sidewalks of the city of Montreal look like mashed potatoes. The city never cleared away the snow that fell during the Dec. 30 snowstorm. Tuesday, Jan. 6: Notre Dame de Grace's Hingston Ave. Isabelle Guibert of Outremont is framed by ice-covered branches as she and the freezing rain has begun to form a layer of ice on city sidewalks and poorly plowed side streets. Pierre Bonin, an official with the city of Montreal, says mild temperatures are forecast for Montreal this week. """"But if conditions deteriorate, and we get more snow in the next few days, then we'll probably begin a snow-clearing operation,"""" he says. Famous last words. """"We're in a state of alert. There are some blackouts and we have to follow things carefully,"""" - Pierre Millette, director of emergency plans for power failures. The highway down from Laval is crammed during a wet, slippery rush hour, but Pierre Pommainville pulls into the St. Laurent weather office by 7:30 a.m. His three children are on their way to the first of five days of school. PIERRE OBENDRAUF, GAZETTE John Abcarius cleans car windshield with shovel on Lincoln St. Or so they believe. At the young age of 37, Pommainville is the shift supervisor among all the meteorologists in the office. That means he's in charge of a team of scientists, most of them casually dressed, all but one of them men. With his big glasses, eager manner and thinning hair, Pommainville looks the part; he'd be only slightly out of place in Flubber. Sipping a coffee, he glances at the morning's papers. A front-page headline in La Presse announces: """"Ça va aller mal!"""" But the article has nothing to do with the miserable weather; it describes the fears of Quebecers for 1998. Now he studies the information in his computer. The data swirl there like a windblown cloud: air movement, temperature, humidity, pressure, fronts, precipitation. To a layman, the patterns would be hard to decipher. Fielding Ave. is blocked by fallen trees. As she scrapes her car's windows on Tuesday, Pommainville understands their meaning. He doesn't like what he sees. A high band of warm, wet air is moving northward from the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, northeast winds have sent a mass of cold, dry air down the St. Lawrence Valley. Montreal looks fated to be the prime battleground between these two streams of air. The latest bulletin had gone out at 3:47 a.m., just as the battle commenced. """"The precipitation,"""" it announced, """"has begun in the form of snow mixed with ice pellets, and is rapidly changing into freezing rain. This zone of freezing rain is already affecting the Outaouais and the Montreal region. Over the morning, it will spread to the Eastern Townships, the Beauce and the centre of Quebec. The freezing rain will become intermittent in the afternoon."""" It's the conjunction of two distinct air masses - a higher, wet one and a lower, dry one - that serves as the catalyst for freezing rain. The moisture starts as snow in the highest clouds, melts into rain as it falls, but then solidifies in the final stretch down. Complicated, but not in itself abnormal: freezing rain affects Montreal a few times in most years. What concerns Pommainville is that such a conjunction usually has a short life span: one air mass or the other tends to get blown away. This time, however, the opposed weather systems look like they're settling in to stay. In the afternoon, Pommainville and his staff issue a new weather alert. It warns that although the freezing rain, ice pellets and snow may be weak this evening, they're expected to intensify overnight and Tuesday. JOHN MAHONEY, GAZETTE Jan. 6, South Shore. In Chateauguay, freezing rain topples a power line, cutting off electricity to 2,000 households. At 9 p.m., Millette calls Rejean Le-vasseur, Hydro's coordinator of maintenance crews. """"We're in a state of alert,"""" Millette tells Levasseur. """"There are some blackouts and we have to follow things carefully."""" Across the St. Lawrence River, near Jarry Park, Marcel Simard is working the night shift at Hydro's nerve centre for Montreal Island. Simard, a distribution operator, is monitoring computer screens that give him updates, every five seconds, of the power grid. DAY 2 JAN. 6 GAZETTE: More weather mess on the way LA PRESSE: Encore plus de verglas LE JOURNAL: Un temps de chien. By sunrise, large pockets of southwestern Quebec, the Outaouais region and eastern Ontario are without power as the freezing rain has turned into an escalating ice storm, downing thousands of tree branches and hydro lines.

Ship rams into house while captain sleeps Tokyo - Haruo Abe did not expect to find a cargo ship in his living room. He was stunned when a 498-tonne tanker crashed into his seaside home in western Japan early Saturday after its captain fell asleep at the helm. Abe, 76, suffered a bruised right shoulder when his house collapsed from the shock of the impact. None of the six crew members aboard the ship was hurt. """"I heard a boom and within three seconds the second floor came falling down,"""" Abe told public broadcaster NHK. """"Then I saw a light and realized it was a ship."""" The 2:30 a.m. accident also demolished a vacant house next to Abe's and badly damaged another nearby residence in Osaki Kamishima, about 640 kilometres southwest of Tokyo. The captain of the vessel told authorities he had fallen asleep when the ship was on autopilot.

Miami International is a major hub for Latin American and Caribbean flights. It was the world's 20th busiest airport by number of passengers in 2003, with 29.6 million. Airlines flew all their planes out on Friday as the hurricane approached, rather than risk having them damaged as they sat on the ground. Miami's airport was crowded with tourists whose vacations were ruined or interrupted by Frances. """"I think it's a big fuss over nothing,"""" said 35-year-old Geraldine Lamb, who was visiting from London. Even as more than 300,000 people in Miami-Dade county were allowed to return to their homes in the afternoon, residents along the west coast from Tampa northward prepared for the storm and headed to shelters. By last night, Frances had been downgraded to a tropical storm, with maximum winds near 105 km/h and its centre about 25 kilometres east of Tampa. Frances was forecast to hit the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm, and potentially restrengthen to a Category 1 hurricane as it headed up the coast, dumping more rain on nearby counties on the way to landfall in the Florida Panhandle this afternoon.

Ghastly sights waited behind them, but almost no one could stay away. Middle School No. 1 was opened yesterday to the people of Beslan, who found themselves drawn toward it by an almost gravitational pull. After the authorities and the Russian army slipped away in the darkness on Saturday night, the school had stood looming and empty, a large and foreboding shell in which hundreds of hostages had died. As word spread that its security cordon had vanished, it seemed as if the entire population of the town appeared to wander its corridors. The Russian authorities announced yesterday that the death count from the hostage siege had reached 338, and many of the wounded remained in critical condition. They also noted that the minister of the interior of North Ossetia, the republic where Beslan is, had submitted a letter of resignation, but that it had been refused. Such news held little attention.

Florida Governor Jeb Bush toured the West Palm Beach area yesterday afternoon, getting a first-hand look at the devastation caused by Hurricane Frances. More than five million people lost power, and four people were killed. The massive storm rumbled across the state yesterday, leaving a wide path of damage. After spending days hovering over the Bahamas, Frances made a leisurely trek across Florida, pummelling most of the state with high winds and torrential rain. Widespread reports of damage include the loss of 50 metres of the Flagler Beach pier, as well as structural damage to buildings and downed trees. The storm was blamed for at least four deaths in Florida, including two people who were killed Saturday when their roof collapsed in Palm Beach County. In the Gainesville area, another man was killed when his car hit a tree, and a woman was killed in her living room when a tree crashed onto her mobile home. More than 33 centimetres of rain fell along Florida's central east coast and caused scattered flooding as a weakened Frances edged toward Tampa. It left behind levelled trees and power.

The cafeteria is full; so are most of the classrooms. """"When some of my loved ones ask me why I do this,"""" says Nash, who has overseen three previous hurricane shelters, """"I say, 'Who's going to do it if I don't?' It's very fulfilling."""" Most people who've sought sanctuary at the school are from the Brevard County area, Nash says. Or maybe they are motorists stranded on Interstate 95, without gasoline or were evicted from unsafe motels. Or they just had no place else to go. """"Some people came here with nothing. No food, no blankets, nothing,"""" Nash says. Good Samaritans have shared life's necessities. As head of the shelter, the 44-year-old Nash works with a Red Cross representative, two West Melbourne policemen and more than a dozen volunteers. She makes announcements - about the weather, a county order to boil all water, and periodic fresh-air breaks for smokers and non-smokers. She makes decisions - such as when to let a mother take her crying child into a private room, where to show a video, Malibu's Most Wanted, to adults. And she makes the occasional peanut butter and jelly sandwich. When the electricity went out in the wee hours yesterday, Nash made sure Ron Murphy, 47, the Red Cross volunteer, could start the school's backup generator. The automatic switch didn't work, so Murphy, a burly mustachioed guy, fought the fierce night winds to fire it up manually. """"I've been doing this for 25 years,"""" he says at one point. """"Why quit now?"""" Nash carries a walkie-talkie as she dashes through gusting winds and rain from her office to the cafeteria to check on everyone. The cafeteria - accommodating 180 people - has air mattresses and sleeping bags strewn everywhere. Lots of people sit at the cafeteria tables - some reading, others talking, still others staring at the walls. Three people play rummy atop a cardboard box. A man naps on a cot. Another reads What Little Girls Are Made Of. One woman is in a wheelchair, another walks with a cane. The air is stuffy and still. Four ceiling fans whir pitifully overhead. Children dance about the room. Some watch a cartoon on video. A couple of kids play with balloons. One girl works vigorously with crayons and paper to bring colour to a drab situation. One towheaded boy has shoes that convert to skates with a flip of the wheels. He glides among the tables. So far Nash has had to deal with a man in a diabetic coma and a pregnant woman who is six days overdue. She made sure both were put in touch with the three registered nurses who happen to be staying here. Many teachers have volunteered to help. So have Nash's husband, Gary, and 15-year-old son, Jared. They serve meals to the residents three times a day. Nash has supplies to last until midday today, but is low on drinking water and bread. She is out of milk. At one point, Nash pulls the brown clip from her blond hair, brushes it several times, puts the clip back and goes back to work. On three hours of sleep, she still has the energy of the committed. As the storm eases in early afternoon, news of damaged homes and fallen trees filters into the shelter. Residents begin to leave, despite warnings from Nash and other officials. On battery-powered radios, police spokespeople tell citizens to stay off the roads. There are tornado warnings. """"There's not much we can do if they want to go,"""" Nash tells Murphy. """"Just stand at the front gate and take down their names and next of kin."""" Nash is ready to go home herself. She'd like a Labour Day break before school begins again, if it begins again. Newscasters are already talking breathlessly of Hurricane Ivan. Nash takes a deep breath and smiles. She'll stay as long as she has to. Police officer Fred Pate stops traffic as he enforces a curfew in Fort Pierce, Fla., yesterday. Hurricane leaves path of damage, flooding. At least two dead in Bahamas; Barbados braces for Ivan. IAN JAMES ASSOCIATED PRESS FREEPORT, BAHAMAS - After two days of roaring winds and severe flooding, Bahamians emerged under drizzly skies yesterday to witness the destruction left by Hurricane Frances - walls sheared from homes, roofs collapsed, yards littered with boats, mangled trees and TV sets. The hurricane left at least two dead and one missing, and officials said they feared the death toll could rise as they surveyed the damage. The northern island of Grand Bahama appeared particularly hard-hit, with several neighbourhoods flooded, fallen trees blocking many roads and snapped power lines lying amid debris. Violent winds tore open a wall at Gary Roberts's home, where waters rushed in shoulder-deep, ruining furniture and mattresses. """"At least we're alive. The contents and everything can be brought back,"""" said Roberts, a 22-year-old who took shelter elsewhere during the storm with relatives. His wife, Ronique Roberts, said a car had floated across their yard during the hurricane, which stalled over Grand Bahama Island and caused widespread damage Saturday. It remained unclear how many homes were flooded in the Bahamas, but officials said they estimated scores - and perhaps hundreds - of homes were damaged on Grand Bahama Island alone. One man was found floating face-down Saturday in a metre of water on the western end of Grand Bahama, police Supt. Basil Rahming said. Police believe the man had been trying to swim to safety from his flooded yard. Another man was electrocuted while trying to fill a generator with diesel as the storm raged through the capital, Nassau, on Friday. Police said they feared a third man in his 30s was probably killed in his wooden house when it collapsed Saturday near the western tip of Grand Bahama. His body had yet to be found. At least five people on the island sustained minor injuries, from a toddler whose face was cut by a piece of flying glass to a man who hurt himself trying to cut a tree in his yard during the storm, said Sharon Williams, the administrator of Rand Memorial Hospital. On Saturday, heavy winds shattered plate glass windows at the Crowne Plaza Resort in Freeport, including lobby windows stretching from floor to ceiling. Honeymooner Curt Crites, 29, of Olympia, Wash., took cover with his wife in a hallway on the hotel's ninth floor after the windows in their room shattered. """"You're thinking about what to do to keep yourself from dying,"""" Crites said. Power remained out in spots across the Bahamas, including Freeport, the country's second-largest commercial centre, where the brunt of the slow-moving hurricane struck Saturday with sustained winds of up to 165 kilometres per hour. Meantime, the eastern Caribbean nation of Barbados was under a storm alert as Hurricane Ivan raced across the Atlantic toward the Caribbean. Ivan, the fourth major hurricane of the season, packed winds of 200 km/h yesterday and was expected to pass by Barbados tomorrow afternoon. Rain date is Sunday.

20080424,modern,rain,"A8 MONTREAL QUEBEC THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, APRIL 24, 2008 Waters rise but runoff contained, officials say Lawyer acquitted of drug charges Would have faced second trial in fall RAIN POSES THREAT 'It was much worse about 10 years ago' ALAN HUSTAK THE GAZETTE Sandbagging operations along the banks of the Mille Îles River and the Rivière des Prairies continue as water levels are reported to be almost two metres higher than normal. Spring runoff has swollen the Ottawa River and its tributaries, but the flooding appears to have been contained and is not as severe as forecast, considering the winter's near-record snowfall, officials say. 'Even though the water levels are receding, we are still concerned about the threat of rain and possibly thunderstorms,' said Lucie Rene, a spokesperson for the borough of L'Île-Bizard—Ste-Geneviève. 'The warm weather (and no rain) in the last few days has helped, but the river is still a few feet above normal,' she added. Catherine Morsink, whose backyard in Pierrefonds is underwater, said she's no longer worried about her house being flooded. 'The landing is underwater, but the house is safe,' she said. 'It was much worse about 10 years ago. It looks like the river is about 40 feet wider, but our sump pumps aren't going like they were earlier this week.' 'We had them running every 10 or 15 minutes, but even when they were running I was more concerned about the pumps being overworked than I was about being flooded,' Morsink said. Climate change blamed as insurance payouts increase Insurance claims relating to water damage are the fastest-growing category of all claims in Canada. But those payouts involve water damage caused mainly by flash storms in summer that result in sewer backups and basement flooding. Quebec insurers paid out more than $500 million in water-related claims in 2005-06, said Jack Chadirdjian, director of public affairs for the Quebec branch of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. That amount represents 45 per cent of $1.1 billion in payouts overall, he noted. 'The 45-per-cent figure is significant because water-related payouts represented only 21 per cent of the total as recently as 2001-02,' he said. 'It's because of climate change,' Chadirdjian said. 'Not just more rain,' he said, 'but more rain compressed into shorter periods of time'—like the 100 millimetres (about four inches) of rain that fell in one hour in Montreal in July 1987. The problem of water damage is particularly acute in the Montreal area, where aging infrastructure can't cope with heavy storms. Residential home insurance policies do not cover water damage as a routine general risk. People who want to be insured for water damage have to purchase special water-damage riders, also known as endorsements or supplements. They generally cost about $50. The difference between water damage caused by sewer backup and water damage caused by floods isn't always clear, Chadirdjian said. Sometimes, people who live blocks away from a shoreline where there has been flooding will have sewer backup without any evidence of invading surface floodwater. Inspectors are very astute at being able to identify the factors, he said. Some of which means you can pick up beef bourguignon, cassoulet and lacquered duck on your way home and be eating dinner 15 minutes later. SATURDAY IN WEEKEND LIFE yesterday as the Rivière des Prairies Samuel Bernard, whose home sits alongside the Rivière des Prairies, said parking lots around several riverfront apartment blocks, like the Marina Centre on Gouin Blvd., are underwater. 'But hopefully the water won't Flood-relief schemes differ among provinces TAXPAYERS BEAR FINANCIAL BURDEN Quebec offers $100,000 maximum; Ontario doubles funds raised by committee Residential property owners can't buy flood insurance in Quebec—or in most of North America, for that matter. But they can, and do, apply for government financial aid after floods—and no more so in Canada than in Quebec, where the provincial compensation plan is worth as much as $100,000. The kind of flood-relief compensation provincial governments offer residential property owners varies widely. But the comparison of Quebec with Ontario is interesting for what it says about political philosophies in the two provinces—and the bottom line for taxpayers.

even lower than forecast on the weather map issued earlier in the day (see Page F6) And with winds of 25-30 kilometres per hour from the west, the temperature will feel more like minus-30 across most of the region """"It's going to be a full seven degrees colder than the seasonal average, and that's a lot,"""" Denis Larochelle, a Weather Network meteorologist, said last night """"When you factor in the wind, it's going to be a real problem for those in unheated houses; plumbing will freeze"""" The winds should let up by nightfall, but the cold temperatures will continue overnight, with a predicted low of minus-18 in the city and minus-20 to minus-22 in the Monteregie A slow-moving high-pressure system from the Prairies will continue to bathe the region in cold, dry air until at least the weekend """"Systems like this have a tendency to stick around for a while, especially in winter,"""" Larochelle said The outlook for tomorrow is more sun and cool temperatures -

""""Any objective person would look at this case and conclude it was a political prosecution aimed at President Clinton,"""" lawyer Dan Guthrie told reporters after the defense team rested its case. The two defendants, bankers Herby Branscum and Robert Hill, are accused of illegally converting bank funds into contributions for Clinton's 1990 campaign for election as Arkansas governor. They also are alleged to have conspired to hide from federal regulators two large cash withdrawals totaling $52,500 made by the campaign. Lead prosecutor Hickman Ewing claimed throughout the trial that Branscum and Hill deliberately broke the law to win favor with Clinton. Both men were appointed to influential state commissions after Clinton won the 1990 election. Defense and prosecution lawyers will meet Judge Susan Wright today to thrash out what instructions will be given to jurors, who will begin deliberations after closing arguments from both sides tomorrow morning. Swedish queen lashes out at kiddie porn REUTER STOCKHOLM - Queen Silvia launched a blistering attack on Swedish politicians yesterday for not taking firmer action against child pornography, surprising Sweden with the forcefulness of her comments. The queen, patron of the world's first congress against child sexual exploitation, to be held in Stockholm next month, said politicians should be compelled to watch at least one film depicting children forced into sexual acts. """"This would force them to act urgently to change Sweden's constitution, which allows possession of child pornography,"""" Queen Silvia said she has seen films found at the homes of Swedish pedophiles and was disgusted by the material. """"It was the worst thing I have seen. It shows torture of the worst kind,"""" she said during an interview on Swedish television and reported in newspapers yesterday. """"Every film that is made is a crime."""" Although Sweden has changed dramatically since the 1970s, when it allowed the commercial production of child pornography, possession is still not considered a crime. Sweden protects possession of child pornography under a constitutional law designed to guarantee freedom of speech. The queen, who will open the five-day World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children on Aug 27, said being faced directly with child pornography makes people realize the depravity of such acts. """"It is (politicians') duty to see, to understand the children's situation,"""" said the queen, who, like the rest of the Swedish royal family, rarely voices her opinions publicly. Although the Swedish parliament voted in late 1994 to change the constitution and outlaw possession of child porn, any constitutional change needs two votes and a second can't take place until after a general election. Sweden's next election is not due until November 1998. Queen Silvia has three children herself. Troops vs floods Soldiers line banks of Yangtze REUTER BEIJING - Chinese troops lined the banks of the mighty Yangtze River yesterday and factories deployed workers to plug leaks in embankments to prevent the rain-swollen river from bursting its banks, officials said. """"The Yangtze is now above the level at which the river broke through its banks in 1931,"""" said an official of the Flood Control Headquarters in the huge industrial city of Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province. """"We are guarding the banks with our lives,"""" he said. """"This is a critical moment."""" Along the river, Asia's longest, troops, paramilitary police, and workers mounted a round-the-clock watch on embankments holding in the rain-swollen waters in check. More than 600,000 people were deployed at intervals of three people every 30 feet and with one person every three feet on most dangerous segments, the official said. Factory workers have been ordered to watch the dikes for cracks and to fill any holes burrowed into the vital embankments by snakes and rats, factory officials said from Wuhan. """"This is the second-highest water level of the Yangtze since records were kept 131 years ago,"""" one official said. Rain was still falling along the upper reaches, posing a future threat, the flood-control official said. In central Hunan province, where floods have killed 195 people in the last few days, officials said torrential rains have stopped and the water level in China's largest freshwater lake, the Dongting, is falling from an all-time high, but remains above the danger level. Floods across a belt of central and southern provinces have killed at least 870 people in China this year and left millions homeless or stranded. About 8 million soldiers, police, students of military academies and civilians have been fighting the floods along the Yangtze river in Hunan and Hubei for days. Almost 4 million people across China had been cut off by flood waters, 810,000 homes have collapsed and 2.8 million homes have been damaged in eight provinces as of July 18, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said. Food-poisoning foil rises ASSOCIATED PRESS TOKYO - The food-poisoning outbreak gripping Japan struck at young and old yesterday, killing a schoolgirl and an 85-year-old woman, and bringing the death toll to seven. The deaths came as the number of cases mounted to more than 8,400 and government officials promised to step up efforts to trace the cause of the outbreak and teach residents how to prevent further infections. The woman died in the western city of Osaka after about 10 days of bloody diarrhea, a key symptom of infection with E. coli 0157 bacteria, said Satoshi Nakamura of the Osaka prefectural Environmental Health Division. Nose drops with lidocaine found to ease migraines for short time RIDGELY OCHS NEWSDAY NEW YORK - Nose drops that contain lidocaine, a common anesthetic, appear to help temporarily relieve migraine headaches, according to a study to be published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In a study of 81 people suffering from migraine headaches, doctors at Southern California Permanente Medical Group in Los Angeles gave 53 patients nose drops containing lidocaine. The other 28 were given nose drops without the anesthetic. Of those who received the lidocaine, 55 percent said their headaches were reduced, by half usually - most within five minutes - compared with 21 percent who received the placebo drops. But 42 percent of those who said the lidocaine helped said their headaches had returned within an hour. Lidocaine, used to relieve sunburn, in dental procedures and even in heart irregularities, has been used to treat cluster headaches, a rarer, generally shorter, but more painful form of headache than a migraine. Lidocaine nasal drops are not commercially available. Why it appears to help relieve pain from migraines is not clear, but Dr. Morris Maizels, the chief researcher, said it might numb a nerve called the sphenopalatine ganglion that is believed to be involved in migraines. Migraines afflict about 17 percent of adult women and 6 percent of adult men in the United States each year. Other headache experts said that while the study was interesting, lidocaine was unlikely to replace other treatments, including sumatriptan, which goes by the brand name Imitrex and works by activating serotonin receptors in the brain. Dr. Lauren Krupp, director of the headache center at University Hospital at Stony Brook, in New York, saw a possible role for lidocaine for those who didn't respond to other treatments. """"It may give us another thing on board,"""" Krupp said. 6 W 9-9, SAT 9-5, SUN 11-5 Premier Lucien Bouchard said Monday victims of this flood will see a sweetened package of financial aid. Most of the details of that package are expected to be revealed by Friday. The package will include $2,500 in emergency aid for people who will be out of their home for two weeks or more. Those hit by the floods are also expected to get reimbursed for a higher portion of their lost home and furnishings. Small businesses are usually eligible for aid equaling half the cost of replacing equipment and essential inventory, up to $75,000, but that also is expected to be increased this time. Many medium-sized firms might suffer more, however, since they are responsible for their own flood insurance, an option which not all buy. Francois Renault, a Boreale Assurances official in Chicoutimi as part of the company's emergency team, said it appears fewer than one in 10 commercial clients in the area had flood insurance. Some of the region's biggest companies said they expect to file multimillion-dollar claims for damages and lost business from closings. Ironically, many of the major companies who will lose production are suffering from a lack of water, after water-service facilities were washed away. The Stone-Consolidated Corp. newsprint mill at La Baie saw its water supply on the Ha! Ha! River ripped away, closing the plant for what is expected to be four to six weeks. """"The pipes and pumping station and all just plain washed away,"""" said company spokesman Denise Dallaire. The plant will lay off its 800 employees and lose production of more than $500,000 of newsprint per day. The losses still haven't been determined, but Dallaire said it will be more than $10 million. """"It's probably closer to $20 million to $25 million,"""" she said. Alcan Aluminium Inc. officials said they couldn't put a value on losses, but had suffered extensive damage to their rail network. Rain keeps people of Jonquiere on edge JONATHON GATEHOUSE THE GAZETTE JONQUIERE - Weary and flood-shocked residents of Jonquiere were left in the dark again last night, after a new storm hit the community, knocking out power for several thousand people downtown. The heavy rains, which dumped more than 10 millimeters in less than half an hour, weren't expected to significantly affect the still-swollen Riviere aux Sables, but they were an unwelcome reminder of the weather-driven devastation of the last few days. Municipal authorities said they expected power would be restored by midnight. For most of yesterday, however, bright sunshine and warm temperatures attracted hundreds of curious onlookers to the city's downtown. As the river's waters slowly receded, it was an opportunity to survey the damage caused by the worst floods in Jonquiere's history. """"It's a phenomenon of nature and we can't do anything about it,"""" said resident Simon Hebert. """"We're powerless in the face of this."""" Hebert was marveling at the remains of a downtown apartment complex on the river's heavily eroded east bank. One building tumbled into the frothing waters 20 meters below on Sunday afternoon. The only trace of the structure are its front balconies and one wildly tilted living room that dangles over the cliff face. A portrait of Christ hangs on the wall above a tartan sofa, and vertical blinds still cover the picture window. Two neighboring apartment buildings in the St. Jean Baptiste complex are perched precariously on rapidly disappearing foundations, large parts of their facades lost in the seething brown waters. A short distance downriver, the Soucy St. dam lies high and dry, covered with logs and other debris. When the dam refused to burst beneath the pressure of the waters, the river chose the path of least resistance and carved a new bed out of the earthen bank, bypassing the old concrete structure. A volunteer worker guarding access to the river's edge said the curious crowds drawn to the disaster scene have created a problem for the city. """"During the first couple of days, people were ignoring the security perimeters,"""" he said. """"But now it's OK. After they saw the force of the water, they became a lot more respectful."""" One kilometer farther downstream are the remains of a new 4-megawatt dam and power-generating plant owned by the city of Jonquiere. The surging waters again jumped their banks leaving a second dam without purpose. The structure was built at a cost of $6 million and had been in service for less than a month. In an interview, Jonquiere Mayor Marcel Martel estimated the cost of repairs would easily exceed $2.5 million. He said even though the province has already agreed to help with the reconstruction, the city stands to lose $800,000 in revenue it hoped to earn from the sale of the electricity. Despite the abundant evidence of the destructive power of nature, not all onlookers were awestruck. Chantal Lavoie, visiting from Quebec City, said she was slightly disappointed. """"On TV it looked a lot worse than this,"""" she said. Mazda's 026 with the performance-driven 160 horsepower, 2.5-litre 24-valve DOHC V-6 puts a whole new spin on the term family sedan. For years people had to settle for a family sedan. Efficient, but boring. The Mazda 626 V-6 changes all of that. Not only is the Mazda V-6 engine a spirited piece of design, but consider what it's married to - our sophisticated Twin Trapezoidal Links rear suspension, stabilizer bars, rack-and-pinion power-assisted steering, and front-wheel drive. So handling is precise, controlled. And with the 626 LX Model, you can get the V-6 with a 5-speed manual stick. Talk about sporty! The 626 boasts the most interior room in its class, and, according to the US National Highway Transport Safety Association, the best frontal crash test results versus 4-door Camry, Accord and Altima.

Maybe next time we'll figure it out. Scott Wentworth's Gunmetal Blues, which has just opened at Theatre Lac Brome in Knowlton, is part cabaret musical, part film-noir murder mystery complete with a fedora-wearing sleuth named Sam. But the mystery gets blown away in the second act, just when people are beginning to get comfortable with the theatrical conventions set up in the first. What's left are the music, the singing and the deliciously tongue-in-cheek dialogue. For a summer's evening in the country that's enough, especially when Jayne Patterson is doing the singing. Patterson, a Charlottetown Festival veteran who made her Montreal debut in Godspell a couple of years ago, is a star on the rise, already on her way to Broadway. She has a key role in the musical Jane Eyre, which is being presented by Mirvish Productions in Toronto this season, before its New York debut. In Gunmetal Blues, she plays The Blonde. Not surprisingly, her big song is called The Blonde Song, which she turns into a high-vamp show-stopper. Sam, played Bogart-cool by Al Goulem, sets the stage with, """"It was one of those gray days in the city. Gray rain out of a gray sky. I was waiting for a client."""" He and the piano player, Buddy Buddy Toupee (Robert Burns), keep the narrative ball rolling throughout this meandering evening. Robert Burns is light-fingered on the ivories and Jayne Patterson is a star on the rise. Burns is as adept on the asides as he is light-fingered on the ivories. His singing is a pleasure, right up to falsetto and back again. Sam is approached by a sexy blonde named Laura Vespers to find the murderer of her boss, Adrian Wasp, a fabulously wealthy man with an alcoholic mistress, an elusive daughter and plenty of enemies. Naturally, Sam has a little trouble keeping his mind on business. And judging from his inability to positively identify a woman he remembers as having """"a mouth that would have sent Shakespeare thumbing through a thesaurus,"""" he has to be legally blind. Exactly what more director Lise-Ann Johnson could do to shape and blend this quirky mix of song and irony into a fully satisfying piece of musical theatre is hard to say. The second act doesn't build on the first. The silly resolution of the mystery is what Stephen King's axe-bearing muse in Misery would call a """"cheat."""" But one must bear in mind that Gunmetal Blues was probably never meant to be much more than a witty talent showcase in the first place. Wentworth's blonde wife, Marion Adler, who collaborated on the music and lyrics with Craig Bohmler, starred in the first professional production of Gunmetal Blues at Theatre New Brunswick several years ago. No one involved had pretensions of usurping Andrew Lloyd Webber, we hope. At Theatre Lac Brome, Jennifer Cooke's discreetly art-deco set design, complete with vintage model planes hanging from the ceiling, is a radical chic approximation of a club called the Red Eye Lounge. And her circa 1940 costumes make three of our most talented young anglo actors look retro glamorous. Gunmetal Blues, by Scott Wentworth, Craig Bohmler and Marion Adler, continues at Theatre Lac Brome through Aug 3. Tickets cost $13 to $20. Call (514) 242-2270. McConaughey shows us he's one to watch CONTINUED FROM PAGE CS lead inevitably to the dramatic summation. In all this, the players shine. Jackson, especially, squeezes more from his role as the vengeful father than his lines deserve. Bullock is suitably feisty, Spacey is sneaky, the Sutherlands, Oliver Platt and McConaughey work the eccentric Old South over pretty good. The mobs act mob-like, and McConaughey shows why he's being touted as the new Newman-Brando screen idol. Despite one ludicrous situation after another, he maintains his coiled poise, then turns on the afterburners in the final courtroom scene. He's one to watch, which is perhaps more than can be said of this movie. To suggest it's the best of the Grisham adaptations is damning with faint praise. To say it will make dandy home-video viewing next winter is closer to the mark. To recommend you see it for the performances and turn a very blind eye to the inconsistencies, tired stereotyping, excessive violence and racial slurs is perhaps closest of all. A Time to Kill opens today at the Angrignon, Boucherville, Chateauguay, Cote-des-Neiges, Dorval, Eaton's, Famous Greenfield Park, Famous Pointe Claire, Lacordaire and Loews cinemas.

A 12 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 24, 1996 Drinking tea might help fight cancer study says JOHN KALBFLEISCH THE GAZETTE Evidence is mounting that tea is not only good but good for you. A Health Canada study has found that tea might inhibit cell mutation caused by compounds known as heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs). These compounds are linked to certain chronic diseases, including cancer. The study was conducted by four researchers led by Bozidar Stavric of Health Canada's bureau of chemical safety. The results appear in the current issue of a British journal, Food and Chemical Toxicology, which was issued yesterday. Decaf, too Stavric's team looked at a representative selection of eight green, oolong and black teas and found that extracts from them stopped cell mutation caused by most HAAs. Decaffeinated and low-caffeine teas, included in the tests because of growing concerns over the safety of caffeine, had the same inhibiting effect. Green, oolong and black teas all come from the Camellia sinensis plant, though they are processed differently. Herbal teas In addition, the researchers looked at six herbal teas, including infusions made from chamomile flowers and ginseng. Here, the results were less conclusive: while some herbal teas had a moderately inhibitory effect on cell mutation, others had no effect and some actually were linked to an increase. """"Further experiments are needed to identify the compounds in common or herbal teas which either possess antimutagenic activity or may, in some circumstances, enhance the activity of mutagens,"""" the study concludes. Stavric and his colleagues also called for additional experiments to see whether their results can be duplicated in tests with laboratory animals.

The two young right-handers are learning how to pitch - how to use their fastballs - in the Class-A South Atlantic League. Both were drafted in June '94 - Powell in the fourth round and Vazquez in the fifth. Powell turned 20 last month, while Vazquez reaches that milestone tomorrow. Californian Powell, 9-5 with an earned-run average of 2.75, apparently has had the most to learn. Puerto Rican Vazquez, 11-2 with an ERA of 2.76 is more of a natural and has what those in the know call a quality feel for pitching. As members of the Delmarva Shorebirds they are tutored constantly by manager Doug Sisson and pitching coach Dean Treanor. While Treanor works on the physical end of the pitchers' development, Sisson drives the mental message home. """"As a rule, you find young hitters at this level haven't seen very much good breaking-ball pitching because they're coming out of high school and collegiate ranks,"""" Sisson, a former catcher in the Twins organization, said during a recent rain delay. """"They have difficulty with breaking pitches. Young pitchers try to take advantage of that. In order to make their records look good they tend to feed the hitters a dose of curves and changes. """"But young pitchers aren't doing themselves any good in the long run with a philosophy like that. We encourage them to be aggressive and use the fastball. We stress the importance of getting ahead in the count and establishing superiority. """"Sometimes that's more difficult than you imagine. We have to make the pitchers understand they're going to need the fastball - and a good one - if they're going to get hitters out at the next level. """"Probably the greatest improvement in Powell this year from last is that he is learning how to use the fastball."""" The 6-foot-4, 220-pound Powell was 5-5 with the Vermont Expos in the New-York-Penn League last summer. """"He is not an overpowering pitcher,"""" Sisson said. """"He can get his fastball up to 93 (mph) and averages out at 90-91.""""

""""I didn't like the environment. It was a different world and it wasn't really where I wanted to be at this point in my career,"""" Lowe said yesterday. Lowe was loaned indefinitely to Guadalajara in a deal concluded by Impact president Joey Saputo several weeks ago to give the talented 21-year-old striker a chance to play at a higher level of competition than in the A-League and to earn more money. A-League salaries range from $15,000 to $40,000 depending on performance incentives. Lowe stood to earn """"three or four times more"""" in Mexico. Under the terms of the agreement with Guadalajara, Lowe could choose to leave if he was unhappy. """"(My decision) had nothing to do with the money. Money wasn't the issue. It's just that for now I feel more comfortable here,"""" Lowe said. Because of commitments with the Jamaican national team, Lowe actual Bangers gamble on Berg Oft-injured forward gets a new deal APCP NEW YORK - The New York Rangers agreed to terms on a new contract with free-agent forward Bill Berg, the team said yesterday. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Berg, 28, began last season with the Toronto Maple Leafs before being traded to New York in February, along with Sergio Momesso, in exchange for Wayne Presley and Nick Kypreos. Due to a broken leg suffered in October, Berg appeared in only 41 games during the 1995-96 season, registering three goals, two assists and 41 penalty minutes. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla - Only a month after the Florida Panthers played in the Stanley Cup final the team might be looking for a new arena.

The MSEA rejected a lease extension worked out in May between the Panthers and Leisure Management.

""""It's a medi-vac,"""" Bouchard said of the latest sortie as the CH-145 Griffon, a $6-million chopper, lifted noisily off the tarmac.

At a press conference yesterday, Blackburn responded to the anger of area residents, and asked why water levels in Lac Kenogami, which feeds the overflowing Chicoutimi and Aux Sables rivers, were kept so high before last week's torrential rains. """"In the 135 years of Chicoutimi's history, this is the worst flooding we've ever seen,"""" Blackburn said.

""""It would be hard to get more accurate predictions than what we had."""" The agency reviewed its weekend procedures to see how it handled predicting the heavy rainfall that battered the Saguenay area.

19930731,modern,rain,"THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JULY 31, 1993 A9 Flooding, tornadoes sweep across Prairies 14-year-old becomes first casualty CANADIAN PRESS SOUTHAM NEWS WINNIPEG - A police diving team continued its search yesterday for the body of Shahid Husain, a 14-year-old boy who waded into a flooded creek in a Winnipeg suburb. And a series of tornadoes swept across north central Alberta late Thursday and early yesterday morning, causing damage to farms and silos. Husain became the first casualty of flooding in the Winnipeg area when he became stuck in the mud and was swept away by the strong current Thursday. """"We have what is normally a quiet little creek that has now become a raging river,"""" said Winnipeg police Sgt. Paul Johnson. It will be some time before streams like the one Husain disappeared in return to normal levels. Usually less than knee-deep in midsummer, Sturgeon Creek is now many metres deep and almost 10 times wider than normal at the spot the youth entered. The swollen Red River, which runs through the city, is expected to crest in the next few days but a floodway will prevent the river from flooding its banks. In all, more than 200 millimetres of rain have fallen in some areas. In Alberta, the 90-kilometre corridor from Holden to Vegreville to St. Paul was the scene of most of the serious damage. One twister followed a path that started 55 kilometres east of Edmonton and tracked northeast. The other hit just east of Falun, a village 75 kilometres southwest of Edmonton. The Sportsman Motor Inn and an Alberta Wheat Pool grain elevator in Smoky Lake, about 70 km northeast of Edmonton, were extensively damaged by another tornado early yesterday morning. Tim Aldie of Environment Canada said yet another tornado may have tracked up toward the Lac La Biche - Fort McMurray area. Wind speed in the Conklin area was clocked at 144 km/h. But the tornado that touched down northwest of the town of Holden was by far the most devastating, said Graham Blundell of Alberta Disaster Assistance. Several properties were levelled or severely damaged and two people were injured when the tornado touched down. Feed containers holding thousands of bushels of grain were thrown about in the maelstrom. One crushed a three-tonne truck. Insulation and debris was strewn in the branches of the trees that still stood. Disaster Assistance officials were surveying damage yesterday. West central Saskatchewan was also hit hard by severe weather from the same system. There, the wind uprooted trees, damaged homes and farms and pounded crops.

Stop Teale from selling story: French's parents Criminals shouldn't profit from deeds CANADIAN PRESS TORONTO - Three weeks after Karla Teale was convicted in the sex slayings of two Ontario schoolgirls, the parents of one of her victims are calling for a law to prevent Teale from selling her story. No one should profit from such abominable behavior, say Doug and Donna French in a letter supporting a private member's bill introduced in the legislature this week. """"It's become common knowledge that several books and a movie on the Teale case are in the works,"""" the Frenches say in their letter to Conservative member Cam Jackson. """"The fact that people want to profit from someone else's tragedy is disgusting but the fact that the criminals themselves can profit from crime is an outrage,"""" they say. """"What kind of a country do we have that allows such an atrocity?"""" Teale was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 12 years in prison in the killings of Kristen French, 15, and Leslie Mahaffy, 14. Her estranged husband, Paul Teale, is charged with first-degree murder and other offences in the same deaths. His trial isn't expected until 1994 or 1995. The bill proposed by Jackson would funnel any money paid to a criminal for an account of his or her misdeeds to Ontario's Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. Attorney General Marion Boyd said she's interested in the idea and has asked lawyers in her ministry to look into its implications. """"This kind of notion of a criminal profiting from his or her crime is very unpalatable to the general public,"""" Boyd said. But she said the government has to consider the fact there would likely be legal challenges from publishers who might feel such a law violates their rights. Meanwhile, it was reported in yesterday's Toronto Star that Karla Teale danced the nights away in the weeks leading up to her husband's arrest. The Star quoted acquaintances of one man who reportedly met Teale at a bar and began dating her. """"It was the ultimate pick-up nightmare,"""" one of his friends told the newspaper. One acquaintance told the newspaper that when the man, who worked as a salesman, saw Karla Teale's pictures splashed across newspapers, he broke off the relationship. """"My God, what have I gotten into?"""" an acquaintance quoted him as saying. Although spurned by the salesman, Teale wanted to keep the romance alive, the newspaper reported. She kept calling him and sent love letters, the newspaper said, adding she enclosed a topless photo of herself in one letter. The Star said the man turned over the letters and the picture to the Green Ribbon police task force investigating the slayings of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy. Clarkson free for weekend in Jasper JIM FARRELL EDMONTON JOURNAL EDMONTON - A Court of Queen's Bench judge said yesterday that millionaire Geoffrey Clarkson can spend the long weekend in Jasper. As part of his bail requirements, the businessman hadn't been allowed to go beyond Edmonton's city limits. He was released from jail July 22. Clarkson's lawyer told Justice Marguerite Trussler yesterday that he thought a weekend in the mountains would be good for Clarkson's health and state of mind and said Crown prosecutor Gary McCuaig had agreed. """"He just wants to get out of the city,"""" lawyer Sid Tarrabain said outside the courtroom. """"He loves the mountains. Next week, I'll be making application to get his passport back so he can take care of his businesses."""" Clarkson was arrested July 16 as he left the Glenora home of Marilyn Tan, his 33-year-old Edmonton girlfriend. Clarkson bought the $535,000 home for Tan last year during one of his business trips to Edmonton. Clarkson is currently charged with conspiracy to murder photographer Con Boland. He's also charged with conspiracy to murder a witness, two counts of conspiracy to plant narcotics on Boland, two counts of conspiracy to plant narcotics on witnesses, two counts of possession of narcotics for the purposes of trafficking and one count of aggravated assault on Boland. Police say the aggravated assault charge against Clarkson involves a February attack on Boland in which the celebrity photographer's face and chest were splashed with concentrated sulphuric acid. Ont. minimum wage to rise CANADIAN PRESS TORONTO - Ontario's minimum wage will rise to $6.70 from $6.35 an hour beginning Jan. 1, the Labor Ministry said yesterday. """"This 5.5 per cent increase will help reduce poverty and will complement reforms of the social assistance system that are designed to help people on welfare to re-enter the job market,"""" Labor Minister Bob Mackenzie said. Ontario Premier Bob Rae promised in the 1990 election campaign to increase the minimum wage to 60 per cent of the average industrial wage and to eliminate the lower rate for younger workers. The rate was raised last fall by 35 cents an hour to $6.35. """"More than 60 per cent of Ontario's 294,000 minimum wage earners are women, many of whom work in small establishments not covered by pay equity. They will benefit from the increase,"""" Mackenzie said. The student minimum wage will also increase by 35 cents an hour to $6.25. Quebec's minimum wage for adult workers will increase to $5.85 in October from $5.70.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. Jeff Maggert made up for a first-day blunder on the way to a 6-under-par 65 yesterday and led John Daly by a stroke after two rounds of the PGA's $1-million St. Jude Classic. Maggert, who was at 10-under 132, could have had a piece of the lead Thursday but for a triple bogey on the par-3 11th hole after going into the water. He settled for a 67 that left him three shots off the pace of Michael Bradley. Yesterday, Maggert birdied the 11th, sinking a 20-foot putt. """"There was a little revenge there,"""" Maggert said. """"Other than that one shot (Thursday), the past two days I've hit the ball really well."""" Daly, a former Memphis-area resident, shot a 66 that included four birdies and an eagle on the par-5 15th hole of the 7,006-yard Players Tournament Club at Southwind. Daly put a 6-iron approach 20 feet from the cup on No. 5. Bradley, a newcomer to the PGA Tour, was unable to match his play of Thursday, shooting a 74 for 138.

20000715,modern,rain,"THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JULY 15, 2000 NATION At least five dead in Alberta tornado Canadian Press PINE LAKE, Alta - At least five people were killed and 38 more were injured last night when a tornado touched down at a central Alberta campground. """"I can confirm at this time five fatalities,"""" said Jim Squire, public information officer for Red Deer County, adding that the numbers """"are obviously not final yet."""" Alberta Premier Ralph Klein was en route to the scene, joining fire, ambulance and emergency crews that flooded in from as far away as Calgary. """"We have all of the fire services in the area headed out there,"""" Squire said. """"There are also police and EMTs (emergency medical technicians)."""" Andrew Schultz, a weatherman for a Red Deer TV station, described the devastation. """"There were hundreds of people walking around with scrapes, bruises - people being carried out on stretchers,"""" Schultz told CBC-TV. """"The fatalities are countless at this time. It looks like something of a rescue camp right now."""" Several hundred trailers have been flipped upside down. """"The injured were being transported to Red Deer, 60 kilometres to the northwest."""" Fire chief Gordon Stewart said the city had sent two buses full of medical supplies. """"The area that was hit was a summer camping trailer park,"""" he said. """"These are small RVs and there was a lot of damage to them."""" Chaos erupted as soon as the tornado hit about 7 p.m. at the Green Acres campground on the southwest corner of Pine Lake. After hitting Green Acres, the tornado apparently moved diagonally across the lake and finished up in a forested area on the far side. Injured people were seen wandering at the side of the road, while others ran around frantically looking for friends and relatives. """"I have heard that the (Green Acres) owner's house is in shreds and that there are trailers strewn all over the place, up in trees,"""" said Carole Sawyer, customer service manager at the nearby Leisure campground. """"We got the hail and the rain and some wind, but we didn't get anything like what they got."""" Pat Yates was visiting her mother-in-law's cabin on the opposite side of the lake from Green Acres when the tornado touched down. """"Power lines were knocked down,"""" she said. """"I wasn't sure what it was, but a lot of ambulances were coming, cars were lining up in the ditches. It didn't look real bad until we kept going."""" """"When you looked in the lake there was a lot of floating debris, like wood - and it looked like parts of trailers."""" """"It was crazy - the wind was just incredible,"""" said Doreen Jorgensen, operator of Scotty's campground near the Green Acres site. """"It was just white. I don't know if it was sheets of rain or hail or what it was, but it was just wild, the wind."""" Jorgensen said the intense storm lasted about 20 minutes, but did not do serious damage at her campground. Witness Lee Urquhart said RCMP were not allowing people anywhere closer than four kilometres from the site. """"There's three city buses (at the campground) to try and transport some of the people who are less seriously injured into the Red Deer Regional Hospital,"""" he said. """"There's uprooted trees, there's these great big 1,500-pound hay bales that look like they've been tossed around like matchsticks."""" Sawyer said """"everyone within a 30-mile radius"""" has flooded the area in an attempt to help. """"Farmers have their tractors and are doing what they can,"""" she said. """"Everybody just pulled together and went down to do what they could."""" Rescue divers and police dogs from Calgary were called in to search for missing people, and a phalanx of tow trucks and ambulances descended on the area. Emergency officials from as far away as Calgary, as well as all those available in nearby communities, were called in to extricate people who were trapped in overturned vehicles and campers. Blair Morrow of Environment Canada said the weather system that spawned the tornado could be seen from Calgary, 150 kilometres away. """"Right now, we have two things,"""" he said. """"There is an upper low, and Red Deer has been moist and humid for the past couple of days, enough to give us a kicker for some convective action. That's like your boiling pot. This upper low, that is what kicked it, then blew the lid off."""" Morrow said a tornado warning had been issued for the area around the same time the funnel cloud touched down. A 1987 tornado in Edmonton killed 27 people and injured 300.

but we still can't swim whenever and wherever we want JANE DAVENPORT The Gazette Mary Richardson remembers when a typical summer day for kids growing up in Pointe Claire automatically included a dip in the lake """"I used to swim at the bottom of the street, where they put the boats in at the launch,"""" she said """"We used to go down every day and swim Where we were there was a beach, and there was sand; you could see to the bottom"""" West Island beaches are a part of Montreal Island's yesterdays, long since replaced by a rocky shoreline and piers stretching out into the waters of Lac St Louis During the 1970s and 1980s, bathing in those waters - and any popular bathing spot in the Montreal region, for that matter - became less and less of a possibility Eventually, the practice of pumping raw sewage from homes into the waterways sent the fecal coliform count in waters around the entire island soaring, turning them into little better than cesspools But for the first time in years, evidence suggests that water quality around the island is not only improving, but may be acceptable for swimming in places And with water samples drawn from 132 sites offshore getting consistently high quality ratings in weekly tests by the Montreal Urban Community, it's hard not to wonder if a return to beach culture is far behind Sandy beaches crowded with bathers once stretched along much of the West Island shoreline, Richardson, who is in her 50s, said """"Everybody would go down to the bottom of their street, and they had swimming lessons,"""" she said """"At the pier, they had stairs, and swimming off all the different areas It was a daily activity for most of the kids that lived around here"""" In the summer of 1981, only seven of 49 public beaches in the area passed provincial government tests required to stay open for the summer Today, only three - Cap St Jacques, Bois de l'Île Bizard, and Parc Jean Drapeau - exist And although the region was once rich in beaches, there are a number of obstacles to their return The first is that while the water around some areas of the island appears cleaner, it isn't clean enough yet to allow people to swim and wind-surf whenever they want Scientists who conduct the MUC testing program have cautioned that a single sample drawn once a week from a former watering hole is not sufficient to declare the site clean or safe Second, although the water- and waste-treatment plant at the east end of the island has had a major impact on contamination of water around the island, there is still a good deal of troubleshooting to be done For example, Daniel Green, an anti-pollution activist with the Société pour Vaincre la Pollution, pointed out yesterday that water contamination can increase sharply the day after a rainfall """"Water quality can vary according to various factors, including rainfall,"""" agreed Jean-Philippe Lafleur, one of the scientists responsible for the testing program """"That's why on our website, we post the weather conditions if the samples were taken when it was raining, if it was one or two days after the rain or more than two days"""" Some West Island municipalities have separate drainage systems for rainwater and sewage, he added Rainwater is pumped directly into the river, while sewage goes to the treatment plant """"In sectors where all the water goes through one system, there are overflow mechanisms When the volume of water is too great (after a rainfall, for example), the overflow will spill directly into the waterway,"""" he said Overflow after heavy rain can affect municipalities with separate drainage systems for rainwater and sewage, he said, but not as often A final problem with the notion of beaches on the island is that the sandy stretches that graced the shores in the '50s just aren't there anymore, and creating new ones would be a complex undertaking Creating a public beach first requires a permit from the Régie des Bâtiments, said a spokesman at the Quebec Environment Department Facilities and supervision must meet the legal requirements stipulated by the Régie A new beach must also be tested and found to be safe for public use Finally, if the beach alters the natural environment in any way prospective beach-owners must prove that the alteration won't endanger existing fauna and flora before getting authorization from the Environment Department to proceed PEGGY CURRAN Questions crop up Bourque deaf to worries about China garden Pierre Bourque must have felt right at home opening Montreal's newest green space this week For one thing, he was, as he so often is, several thousand miles away, back in his beloved China, inaugurating the $5-million Montreal Garden, a park that the overwhelming majority of his constituents and taxpayers will never get to see And, again as usual, he brushed aside anyone who threatened to rain on his parade - in this case, by questioning living and working conditions of the crews who built the project """"They work and they have food, they live very well,"""" Bourque said of reports migrant workers had lived eight to a room in leaky thatched huts with dirt floors """"The weather is perfect there They have tables, benches In Shanghai, that's the way they do that"""" It was a predictable refrain from the mayor, who has made a political career out of nebulous replies When The Gazette's Linda Gyulai visited the site with Bourque a year and a half ago, she reported the mayor appeared to be blithely unaware of the stark conditions endured by workers, who were then - it was January - living in tents or makeshift lodgings sectioned off with strips of plastic sheeting """"We have followed all the bylaws,"""" he said in a conference call with reporters Thursday """"The working conditions in Shanghai are the best in China"""" The mayor may be right Perhaps working conditions really are better in Shanghai than they are in the rest of China Yet for all its historical allure and economic bustle, Shanghai is still part of a country stained by the legend of Tiananmen Square, where human rights are for other people Activists here and abroad argue, with good reason, that a project that bears Montreal's name, and which has been funded with $3 million in federal, provincial and municipal money, should have set a better example ANKLE-DEEP MUD According to the China Labour Bulletin, a Hong-Kong-based agency which monitors working conditions, crews on the Montreal project worked 12 to 13 hours a day, had to provide their own food and lived eight to a room in huts where rain transformed dirt floors into ankle-deep mud Carole Samdup specializes in globalization issues at the Montreal-based International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development Substandard housing, low pay and poor working conditions are a common problem in the developing world, she said But that's no reason why a project paid for with public money and purportedly promoting Canadian business interests must do the same """"If we don't do something about it when we have an opportunity, nothing will change What happened to the trickle-down economy?""""

in Toyota's Prius, the gasoline engine doesn't even start until the car is traveling 22 km/h To restart the Insight, simply flick the gear lever into first, the engine pops to life instantly and away you go The auto-stop feature is designed as much to reduce emissions as cut fuel consumption (the two obviously go hand in hand - the less you put in, the less you'll get out) The Insight isn't the fastest vehicle off the line You have to be prepared to work the gearbox to achieve a comfortable level of acceleration when pulling into traffic, but once rolling (on harder, low-rolling-resistance tires) the car motors along smoothly and quickly Digital gauges tell you the vehicle's speed, its current and historic fuel economy and the degree to which you ruined every picture she was in I hired a photographer whose work I had seen for my daughter's wedding I was sure he'd do a good job When I Sotomoni Mines 1985, action 7594405 (SB Universal Soldier: le combat absolu 1999, science-fiction) Jean-Claude Van Damme 8827973 (SPACE King Kong vs Godzilla 1963, science fiction) Michael Keith CUBS Mystery Men 1999, fantasy) Hank Azaria 7644221 (OHM) Thelma & Louise 1991, drama) Susan Sarandon 166757 10 PM Q Swann 1996, mystery) 30863 CD Une phile de pterins 1993, comédie dramatique) Bruce Jones 8675318 (HM) Gus 1976, fantasy) Edward Asner 2490950 S6JD Desperate Hours 1990, crime drama) Mickey Rourke 8375252 CDSD No Man of Her Own 1950, drama) Barbara Stanwyck 58863 10:25 (SB Loin de 1997, drame) Jeremy Irons 40944028 10:40 (POO Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold 1987, adventure) Richard Chamberlain 90518028 10:50 O Biais 1998, drame) Miou Miou 96751216 11 PM d ED Incognito 1999, romance) Richard T Jones 769689 (SPACE King Kong Escapes 1968, science fiction) 11:05 SrJHJD The Pillow Book 1996, drama) Vivian Wu 29648047 11:30 CffSK Colors 1988, crime drama) Sean Penn 984776 11:40 (Q Mere Indigne 1994, docudrame) Crissy Rock 18469009 (ESHJ To My Daughter With Love 1994, drama) Rick Schroder 48296080 Om Passion's Desire 1998, suspense) 48219931 11:45 (MAS) The Mirror Crack'd 1980, mystery) Angela Lansbury 8171134 11:50 CJLe Loin 1993, suspense) Dennis Quaid 9598028 SB Parfum d'Emmanuelle 1993, pour adultes) Marcela Walerstein 7236028 QSTJS The Road Warrior 1981, science fiction) Mel Gibson 36348641 12 AM nPure Luck 1991, comedy) Martin Short 91142 G3 Geronimo: An American Legend 1993, historical drama) Wes Studi 7854784 (MB Longitude 2000, miniseries) Michael Gambon 762790 G3B Los Ordres 1974, docudrame) Jean Lapointe 7530871 (SD Folio de mot 1995, comédie) Grace de Capitani 3480239 12:25 (PSD King Rat 1965, war) George Segal 66947697 12:40 SB Vendetta 1999, drame) Christopher Walken 57396516 1 AM fBBTI JFK 1991, docudrama) Kevin Costner 7645239 (SPACE) Quest for Odin 1985, science fiction) (WTtTI Thelma & Louise 1991, drama) Susan Sarandon 577448 1:05 O Manhattan Murder Mystery 1993, comedy) Woody Allen 5558697 1:30 C!Ty American History X 1998, drama) Edward Norton 466429 (BSD The Dark Wind 1991, crime drama) Lou Diamond Phillips 568871 1:45 tBRed Line 1996, acti",

DANNY GOHLKE AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE VIA GETTY IMAGES ALBANIA - Hold the hot wax finish: A boy ducks under a tree to avoid the water at a car wash in Tirana, where temperatures reached up to 42 degrees C. ENGLAND - No need for a car wash after driving through the floodwaters in Hull yesterday. AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE REUTERS Athens - A heatwave has claimed four lives in Greece and Cyprus and killed six more people in Romania as temperatures soared to 46 degrees Celsius in parts of southeast Europe. Turkey also reported deaths blamed on the intense heat, while three people drowned in Bulgaria swimming in unsupervised dams and beaches during the weekend as temperatures climbed well above early summer averages. Greece, which has seen some of the highest temperatures, is set to record its hottest June. Athenians emerged from the city's subway clutching newspapers over their heads to try to stave off the blazing sun, while tourists with bottles of water took shelter under the few trees in the city centre. In Turkey, Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler said pregnant and disabled public servants would be given days off today and tomorrow because of the extreme heat. Twenty-five people have died in Romania during the recent hot spell, health ministry data showed yesterday. Hot weather is expected to last throughout the summer, affecting cereal crops and hydropower production, officials said. Forest fires were also reported near several prominent tourist spots on Turkey's Mediterranean coast. In Britain, torrential downpours left three dead and hundreds stranded yesterday as storms continued to batter Russia and a heatwave in southern Europe led to further deaths and sparked fires. Several hours of effort from rescuers including police divers was not enough to save a 28-year-old man in Hull, northwest England, who died after becoming trapped while trying to clear a flooded drain. Local police in nearby Sheffield said later they had recovered the body of an unidentified young man, though his body was found downstream from where a teenage boy was earlier reported to have been swept up by the floods. In Italy, helicopters and specially adapted aircraft joined firefighters on the ground yesterday to fight a series of fires in Calabria and on the island of Sicily, as a heatwave there continued. The situation was particularly serious in Sicily, where media reports said a number of hotels near the northwest coast had to be evacuated. In Pakistan, thousands of people were removed from southern coastal areas yesterday ahead of a possible cyclone, two days after a storm killed at least 235 people in the port city of Karachi, officials said. The meteorological department issued an alert saying a tropical storm forming in the Arabian Sea 150 kilometres south of Karachi was likely to intensify into a cyclone in the next six to 12 hours. Fishermen were advised to stay ashore until Thursday in some areas because of the likelihood of """"extremely"""" rough seas. At least 10 fishermen have been missing since the weekend, officials said. Karachi is still reeling from a deadly thunderstorm on Saturday, with parts of the sprawling port city of 12 million people still without electricity or drinking water. The shortages have led to several riots. In China, at least 155 people have died in flooding so far this year mainly in the south, while about 2 million people are suffering from drought in the north, the government said yesterday. Flooding has caused more than $1.3 billion in damages. SPORTS I TENNIS THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, TUESDAY, JUNE 26, 2007 OPEN COURT WIMBLEDON Retractable roof for Centre Court won't help much STEPHANIE MYLES It only seems as if it rains all the time during Wimbledon. The statistics tell another story. The centerpiece event of tennis averages less than one complete washout every four years (one day in every 50). Of course, that's a rather dodgy number, since a rainout (meaning the very expensive tickets must be refunded by the All England Club) means less than one total hour of tennis in a day. The first year Wimbledon's Centre Court opened in 1922, the opening match was delayed nearly two hours and the tournament itself continued until Wednesday of the third week. The forecast for yesterday's opening day was terrible going in, and indeed the weather was awful around Britain. Yet, somehow, they got a lot of tennis in, even if the start of play was delayed 90 minutes on the two biggest courts and 2½ hours everywhere else. The weather supposedly gets much better as the English summer wears on; even a few weeks would make all the difference. But the tournament will never change the dates; instead, they'll have a retractable roof on Centre Court in 2009. That means fans with tickets there will get their tennis, but it won't do much for the seemingly annual backlog from which the event must recover. Yesterday, of 32 men's matches, seven were suspended because of darkness and 12 weren't started at all. Of the 32 women's matches, 14 never got on court and four were suspended. All of those, plus first-round matches in the bottom half of both draws, are scheduled for today. Here's the forecast from the official Wimbledon site; draw your own conclusions: """"Some areas dry for a time (Monday) evening, but rain soon returning, some heavy and prolonged. The rain gradually clearing eastwards with all areas becoming dry by morning with some cloud breaks developing, but becoming very windy. Isolated showers (today) but most places dry with sunny spells developing, the strong winds slowly easing down."""" That narrows it down. It's all being blamed, in that deadpan British way, on an """"incredibly persistent"""" ridge of low pressure. First on, first out: Aleksandra Wozniak, the only Canadian woman in the main draw, was scheduled first on Court 15 and, despite the late start, got through her match without a stoppage in play. Unfortunately, for the second time in two weeks, the Blainville native came out on the losing end, 7-6 (4), 6-3, against American journeywoman Laura Granville. Wozniak was up a break in the first set, gave it back when serving to go up 5-3, then had a set point while serving at 5-4, only to be broken as Granville converted her first break opportunity of the game. She fell down early in the first-set tiebreaker, got it back on serve, then gave up two straight points on her own serve to lose the first set. In the second set, serving to stay in the match at 3-5, Wozniak was broken at love. In tennis, love is nothing: Martina Hingis was always considered the """"black widow"""" of tennis. Every male player she dated, it seemed, immediately found his career going down the drain - coincidence or not. Remember Magnus Norman and Ivo Heuberger? Didn't think so. But now, since her engagement to veteran Czech pro Radek Stepanek shortly before the New Year, it seems she's turned the tables on herself. Rarely injured in her career, she has struggled with a left-hip injury that's still only 60-per-cent healed, missed the French Open because of it, and barely squeaked through her first-round match at Wimbledon yesterday saving two match points in the second set before rolling through the third against local favourite Naomi Cavaday. Hingis did well at the Australian Open, won a tournament in Tokyo right after that, but is 6-5 since, typically losing in the second round without putting up much of a fight. Nadal's good-luck charm: The first time the very private Rafael Nadal brought his girlfriend to a tournament was at last year's Wimbledon, where he reached the final. Francesca """"Xisca"""" Perello, a 19-year-old student also from Mallorca, is there again, hoping history repeats itself once more. No more knicker-picking: Speaking of Nadal, fans of the """"gaucho-pant"""" look might be in for a shock today when the No. 2 seed and French Open champion takes the court for his first-round match against American Mardy Fish. At an exhibition last week, Nadal ditched the clamdiggers in favour of more classic white shorts, thus sending Nadal fashion fans all over the world into conniptions. If you thought the young man had twisted steel for arms, wait until you see the quads, heretofore hidden underneath the knee-length pants. The good news is that one of his most annoying habits, that of """"disengaging"""" his ubiquitous wedgie before every single point (which has led the British tabloid press to anoint him with the most-unflattering nickname of the Knicker Picker), may be history with the looser shorts. smyles thegazette canwest.com TENNIS Chairs were finally provided for players in 1975 CONTINUED FROM CI In 1946, play resumed at Wimbledon and by 1949, the grounds were fully restored to their prewar state. The U.S. cursed his luck when he was drawn in the same half as Federer, but the big server was in fine form when he took the first steps toward a possible semifinal showdown with the top seed. He fired 16 aces en route to a 6-1, 7-5, 7-6 (3) win over compatriot Justin Gimelstob. A decade from her 1997 title triumph, Hingis seemed to have forgotten her status as ninth seed and twice came within a point of losing to a woman who had won only two Tour matches in her career. In the end, Cavaday lacked the energy to pull off the biggest win of her tennis career and bowed out 6-7(1), 7-5, 6-0. Hingis's chances of adding to her tally of five Grand Slam crowns looked rather bleak when she faced two match points. """"It was never on my mind that I'm going to lose,"""" said Hingis against the 232nd-ranked Cavaday at 4-5 in the second set. Cheered by a partisan crowd on Court 2, Cavaday's nerves got the better of her when it mattered. She scooped the ball into the net on her first match point and was outclassed by a Hingis winner on the second. Hingis appeared bemused by her great escape, but then showed her ruthless streak, rolling over Cavaday in the decider. Upon turning professional later that year, the LTA voted overwhelmingly to open the championships. In 1968, the first """"Open"""" championships were held, with Laver and Billie Jean King the first such champions. The following year saw Laver win the singles for the fourth time and - in one of the greatest matches of all time - Pancho Gonzales and Charlie Pasarell contesting a first-round match containing 112 games. The match was all the more remarkable given that it was not until 1975 that chairs were provided for the first time for players to rest when changing ends. In 1977, the championships celebrated their centenary, with Virginia Wade memorably providing a home triumph. """"It was never on my mind that I'm going to lose,"""" said Hingis, who missed the French Open with an injury. """"I know Court 2 is a graveyard of champions, but I've never lost there. I'm still in the draw. It's all that matters."""" Justine Henin and former champion Serena Williams overcame dank and distracting conditions to progress. French Open winner and top seed Henin began her bid to complete her set of major trophies with a 6-3, 6-0 humbling of little-known Argentine qualifier Jorgelina Cravero. Williams proved equally unstoppable and shrugged off a hamstring strain to overwhelm Spain's Lourdes Dominguez Lino 7-5, 6-0. Drizzle delayed the start of Federer's match by almost two hours. Once he stepped on to a chilly and roofless Centre Court, he seemed to be in a rush to slip back into his stylish new cream blazer and trousers. Federer ended 86th-ranked Gabashvili's Wimbledon debut in 93 clinical minutes. As shadows crept over Centre Court, Tim Henman made home fans run through the usual gamut of emotions before fading light forced postponed play with the Briton locked at 5-5 in the fifth set vs. former French Open champ Carlos Moya of Spain. Ladies' singles, the centenary of which was of course not celebrated until 1984. Two years later saw the introduction of tiebreakers at 6-6 in all except the final set of a match. Umpires also were issued stopwatches to ensure players did not exceed time limits when changing ends thanks to their new comfortable seats! An electronic service-line monitor - later known as Cyclops - was introduced in 1980, but did not prevent Bjorn Borg from winning the title for the fifth time in succession. The Swede was the first to do so since William Renshaw in the late 1880s, when there was a challenge round. Records continued to be broken almost every year, both on and off the court.

White Out: Anne White caused an uproar when she turned out for her first-round match in 1985 in a full-length, skin-tight catsuit. Her match was postponed because of fading light, giving the authorities their chance to ban her attire for the following day's conclusion. 9. Giant Upset: The opening day of the Championships in 2003 delivered a huge upset when defending champion Lleyton Hewitt was hammered by 6-foot-10 Croatian Ivo Karlovic. """"There wasn't a whole heap I could do,"""" Hewitt said. 8. Bare Facts: The 1996 final between Richard Krajicek and MaliVai Washington was delayed when a female streaker raced across Centre Court during the pre-match photographs. """"She put a smile on my face and broke the tension,"""" said Krajicek, who went on to win. 7. Henman's Heave-ho: Tim Henman was hardly living up to his clean-cut image in 1995 when he was booted out of the men's doubles competition for inadvertently battering a ball at a ball girl's head during a moment of frustration in his match alongside Jeremy Bates. 6. Gorgeous Gussie: """"Gorgeous"""" Gussie Moran caused scandal at the 1949 tournament when she stretched the dress code to the limit by sporting clearly visible frilly knickers beneath her skirt. Organizers might have been in uproar, but Moran made the front page of newspapers and magazines across the world. 5. Magic Martina: At the age of 46, Martina Navratilova broke an eight-year title drought and drew level with Billie-Jean King by winning her 20th Wimbledon title when she teamed with Leander Paes to claim the mixed doubles crown in 2003. 4. Cliff's Chorus: As if a lengthy rain delay wasn't bad enough, spectators braving the elements on Centre Court in 1996 were subjected to an impromptu sing-along by Royal Box guest Cliff Richard, backed by an implausible choir of female tennis stars including Conchita Martinez and Pam Shriver. 3. The Tiebreaker: The fourth set tiebreaker of the 1980 final between Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe ranged over 34 points and 22 minutes and is regarded as one of the finest passages of play in the sport's history. McEnroe took the set, but Borg went on to clinch the match. 2. Tarango's Tantrum: American Jeff Tarango blew his top after a series of disputed line calls in his 1995 match against Alexander Mronz, storming off court and defaulting before his wife, Benedicte, marched up to umpire Bruno Rebeuh and slapped him in the face. Tarango was barred the following year. 1. Goran Wins: Hampered by a chronic shoulder injury, three-time runner-up Goran Ivanisevic arrived at the 2001 tournament with few expectations. After an unforgettable """"People's Monday"""" final against Pat Rafter, he became the first wild card to win the title. 5770 Taschereau Blvd Brassard 450-923-7777 www.prestige lexusca I fit it IIIJJJU Ill IIIIIIMI J II 1 J!- j ! r- !

Weather-beaten Manitoba warned: It's not over yet. RESIDENTS COUNT THEIR BLESSINGS About 80 tornadoes hit Canada every year, causing an average of two deaths. LARISSA LIEPINS CANWEST NEWS SERVICE WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Winnipeg - As residents in Manitoba counted their blessings and tallied the damage yesterday after a spate of weekend tornadoes, Environment Canada warned more severe weather was headed their way. Large hail, high winds and a """"torrential rainfall"""" of at least 50 millimetres or more was forecast overnight to pound the southern part of the province, where hundreds were still without power. Torrential downpours throughout the province have already resulted in several high water-level advisories, including the Red River in Winnipeg. Environment Canada said it received five reports of tornadoes touching the ground on the weekend. The twisters left a swath of heavily damaged cottages and downed power lines across the southern part of the province. Ron Mustek and three friends were on a weekend camping trip at a trailer park in southwest Manitoba when the tornado hit Saturday night. """"It hit without any warning,"""" said Musick, who was inside his camper with a friend when he felt the winds. """"We started feeling the trailer flipping over. We hit the floor and tumbled for about 30 seconds. It was unbelievable. It rolled two complete revolutions, about 25 to 30 feet. Everything's flying in there, frying pans. When you're spinning inside, you're wondering when and how it will end."""" Each man sustained cuts that required stitches at the hospital, and Musick said his trailer is a """"total write-off,"""" but he's hoping his insurance covers it. While they were inside, Mustek's friends Scott and Brian Baldwin were outside, trying to get their canopy down. """"Something hit me from behind, I have no idea what,"""" Brian Baldwin said. """"I slammed into something, it was probably the ground. Then, when I looked up, I was about five feet away from a tree, so I crawled over and grabbed it. It was so fast, so quick, you had no time to even think. We're just lucky to be alive."""" Manitoba Hydro crews were still working to restore power to hundreds of homeowners and businesses. As many as 600 cottages in Whiteshell Provincial Park remained without power after a tornado touched down in the area. It could be """"still a couple of days"""" before it's restored to the eastern area about 140 kilometres east of Winnipeg, said Manitoba Hydro spokesperson Glenn Schneider. It could take the utility company until the weekend to replace 200 hydro poles destroyed across the province. In the province's southwest about 11,000 homeowners and businesses went without power for varying lengths of time, Schneider said. About 200 rural homeowners in southwest Manitoba were without power yesterday. Costs not covered by private insurance might be picked up by the province's disaster financial assistance program, although it does not cover damage to vacation homes such as cottages that aren't principal residences. In Canada, about 80 tornadoes occur every year, causing an average of two deaths and 20 injuries, plus tens of millions of dollars in property damage, says Environment Canada. These are the reported numbers, but many more tornadoes strike unpopulated areas and go undetected. The odds of dying from a tornado are 12 million to one, but more than half of tornado deaths occur inside mobile homes. The coming downpour wasn't likely to help the situation. Early yesterday the Red River was at 4.5 metres in downtown Winnipeg, more than 2.5 metres above normal summer levels. Flooding is expected in some low-lying areas between Letellier and St. Jean, Man. Like it really hot? Here it comes. Today's forecast could break record. An oppressively hot weather system will be hovering over southwestern Quebec today and tomorrow. Environment Canada issued a high heat and humidity warning for Montreal and Laval yesterday that extends through tomorrow. The agency is forecasting a high of 34 Celsius today, which would break the record of 33.4C set in 2003. The Weather Network forecast a high of 32. A 30-per-cent to 40-per-cent chance of rain tomorrow could cut the humidity. The heavy, humid air could cause problems for anyone suffering from chronic illness, such as heart and respiratory ailments. Heatstroke, cramps and exhaustion are also possibilities for anyone who spends a great deal of time outdoors in this type of weather. Environment Canada suggests drinking lots of water, staying where it is air conditioned and avoiding physical activity outside. The Weather Network, the service used by The Gazette, is calling for a high of 32C today and highs and lows of 30C and 15C tomorrow, with a 40-per-cent chance of thunderstorms.

THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2006 Rail, winds storm into town TREES TOPPLED Two deaths blamed on slick roadway JAN RAVENSBERGEN THE GAZETTE Toppled trees, crushed cars, streets clogged with debris-these were scenes across Montreal Island yesterday that rekindled memories of the January 1998 ice storm. But the damage inflicted by Friday evening's freezing rain, and the violent winds that followed, was on a much less disastrous scale. The stormy weather was a factor in an accident about 40 kilometres east of Montreal that killed two people, police said. A driver and a passenger were killed late Friday in a head-on collision involving their vehicle and a large truck on a two-lane road in the town of St. Jean Baptiste, near Mont St. Hilaire. The road was slippery, police said. The freezing rain, working in tandem with heavy gusts of wind that swept through southern Quebec yesterday morning, created havoc on and off Montreal Island. Reports of at least 200 road mishaps flooded in from across the Surete du Quebec's off-island territory, SQ Constable Marc Butz said. No one was killed and no major injuries were reported. """"There were many cases of cars losing control, leaving the road and ending up in the ditch-everywhere there were heavy winds,"""" SQ Constable Manon Gaignard said. There were also many vehicle accidents in Montreal but no reports of any weather-related deaths or severe injuries, as well, Montreal police Constable Raphael Bergeron said last night. He said he could not estimate the number of fender-benders. The westerly winds at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Dorval were blowing steadily at 63 kilometres an hour at 6 a.m. yesterday, gusting to 76 kilometres an hour by 7 a.m., Environment Canada said. By 10 a.m., they were still being measured at 63 kilometres an hour. Montrealers in residential neighbourhoods were left picking up the pieces, in many cases literally, often with the power out. In Notre Dame de Grace, a mature tree snapped off close to the ground and fell across Marcil Ave., shattering the rear window and damaging the trunk of Eric Longtin's BMW. The fallen tree completely blocked traffic near de Maisonneuve Blvd. A few blocks north of Longtin, several of his neighbours awoke with the same morning-after headache. Another mature tree, also at least 10 metres long, had been ripped out by its roots. That tight race to replace Klein SUPPORT SURGES Second-choice votes DEAN BENNETT CANADIAN PRESS Edmonton - Former Alberta finance minister Jim Dinning pulled away from his rivals in early vote returns in the race to replace Premier Ralph Klein, but appeared to fall short of the majority needed for a quick victory. With 60 of 83 constituencies reporting, Dinning was first with 40 per cent of the vote in the Progressive Conservative party leadership election. Veteran cabinet minister Ed Stelmach was second with 33 per cent and rookie backbencher Ted Morton was last with 27 per cent in the vote by party faithful. If no candidate commands a majority of votes, the third-place finisher drops off the ballot and his supporters' second-choice votes will be apportioned to the other two. There was concern in the Dinning camp that should his ideological foe Morton drop off the ballot, the majority of his supporters will have voted for Stelmach as their second choice. As the results were flashed on giant screens in an old airplane hangar north of the city's downtown, legions of Stelmach supporters in white T-shirts and blue scarves cheered, waved Ed signs and chanted """"Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!"""" It was a surprising leap in popularity for Stelmach compared to ground-roots and all. Police issued a warning early yesterday that wind-blown branches - and in some instances construction materials - made navigation of some roads hazardous. Montreal police Constable Olivier Lapointe urged motorists to be very careful. Shortly before noon, a green residential recycling box driven by the wind was spotted skittering across St Jacques St W near Cavendish Blvd, far from any residences. Today, Environment Canada is calling for cloudy conditions, a high of minus 1 C, and two to four centimetres of snow beginning late in the morning. Another two centimetres of snow is expected overnight tonight, with westerly winds of 20 kilometres an hour and a low of minus 5. The Weather Network forecasts about one centimetre of snow during today, with morning temperatures of minus 7 C, winds of five kilometres an hour and an evening low of minus 1 C. In eastern Ontario, about 33,000 homes and businesses remained without electricity last night after Friday's storms knocked out power and wreaked havoc on the roads. About half the customers without electricity were in the Vankleek Hill and Winchester areas. The storms were also blamed for a mudslide in the Durham region, east of Toronto. In the United States, thousands of people were without light and heat yesterday after the Midwest's first big snowstorm of the season. The storm was blamed for at least 11 deaths as it cut a swath from Texas to Michigan and then blew through the Northeast early yesterday. Canadian Press and Associated Press contributed to this report. With the first round of voting last week, when 97,690 party members across the province marked an X, Dinning was first with 30 per cent, four percentage points ahead of Morton and double the total of Stelmach. Although lacking the campaign war chest and headline-grabbing quotes of his rivals, the 55-year-old northern Alberta farmer from a rural constituency north of Edmonton made up for it with a down-home appeal to honour, integrity and common sense that garnered supporters on both sides of the rural-urban divide. Dinning had been organizing his leadership for some four years and was perceived as the front-runner since the start of the campaign. Despite being out of government for almost a decade, he had the support of more than half the Tory caucus. The leafless branches of trees on Mount Royal were still cloaked with ice yesterday morning from the freezing rain that pelted the city. A light snowfall is forecast for the Montreal region today. Thousands still without electricity. Almost 44,000 households and businesses across Quebec were still without power at 9 p.m. yesterday after 37.6 millimetres of freezing rain hit the Montreal region and the Laurentians on Friday evening. Those included about 12,000 on Montreal Island. More than 250,000 Hydro-Quebec customers had been left in the dark at the peak of the disruption, at 8 p.m. Friday. Of these, 105,000 were on the island of Montreal. Hydro-Quebec official Flavie Cote said in an interview last.

An avid animal lover, at present her menagerie includes three horses, five dogs, three cats, four rabbits and koi fish. VARIES (March 21-April 19): Rethink how you are handling a personal situation. Accept the circumstances that are outside your control. Minor frustrations will dissipate soon, so it isn't necessary to plan major changes. TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Hold your head high. You have a lot to be proud of this week. Convoluted conversations might steer you in the wrong direction. Suspicions or fears have a tendency to dampen the fun. GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Plots and plans, like pots and pans, can create a lot of noise but are only useful if you are cooking up something really satisfying. Hold off on making major decisions for the next several days. CANCER (June 21-July 22): Schemes and dreams don't mix. You may be overly sensitive to slights or easily offended by callous attitudes. When somebody """"tells it like it is,"""" just let it go in one ear and out the other. LEO (July 23-August 22): Slow and steady always wins the race. Changing course can land you in the drink during the first part of the week. Don't take criticism personally, even if it bruises a slightly sensitive spot. VIRGO (August 23-September 22): Something you hear might hit much too close to home. That doesn't mean that you must act on it.

Perhaps, but just after midnight a sign of things to come: Dion squeaked into third place, surpassing Gerard Kennedy.

Kennedy dramatically quit the race after only the second ballot, instantly propelling Dion into first place on the third ballot - but shy of the magic 50-per-cent threshold needed to win, Caught in an unpredicted scenario, Bob Rae released his delegates - the lion's share of whom moved to Dion, Please see DION, Page A7 What's next?

Another day in the life of typhoon territory Expected death toll 800-plus in latest battering of Philippines OLIVER TEVES ASSOCIATED PRESS PADANC, PHILIPPINES - Doomed by geography and hobbled by poverty, the Philippines has long struggled to minimize damage from the onslaught of typhoons it faces each year, But the high death tolls and destruction persist, with the latest storm leaving more than 800 people dead or missing in the northern Philippines, Typhoon Durian was the fourth major storm to hit the country in four months, It buffeted the Mayon volcano with so much wind and rain ash and boulders cascaded down in walls of black mud that swamped entire villages on Thursday. The Philippines' location in the northwestern Pacific often makes it the region's welcome mat for typhoons, """"We are often the first to experience typhoons before they go to China, Taiwan and Japan,"""" said Thelma Cinco, senior weather specialist of the Philippine weather bureau, Durian, named after a thorny fruit with a powerful odour that many find offensive, blew away roofs, toppled trees and power lines and sent tonnes of rocks and volcanic ash down Mayon, the region's most famous landmark about 340 kilometres southeast of the capital Manila, Rescuers scouring mountain villages buried under mud and boulders discovered more bodies yesterday and prospects for finding any of the 300 missing people alive were fading, The first funerals were held yesterday evening as bodies rapidly decomposed in the tropical heat, In Padang, only rooftops protruded from the mud and debris, Power pylons were toppled, a two-lane highway became a one-lane road strewn with debris and overturned trucks, Silangan Santander, 21, attended funeral services for her brother, Larry, whose widow was five months pregnant, Only his lower torso and legs were found near the sea, Another brother was missing, """"In the community where my brother lived, all the houses there were gone,"""" she said, """"There are only rocks, sand and water,"""" The sound of boulders crashing down Mayon's slopes """"were like thunder and the ground shook,"""" she said, """"We thought it would be our end,"""" The Red Cross appealed for food, tents, water, blankets, mats, mosquito nets and body bags, Canada donated $1 million, while Japan said it would send the equivalent of about $200,000, the Philippine government said, Across the Philippines, at least 2,892 people have been killed and 909 are missing in storms between 2001-05, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said, Damage has totalled the equivalent of $595 million, The calamities came despite preparations and measures to mitigate the damage, Anthony Golez, the council's deputy chief said the people of the Philippines need to be better informed about disaster preparedness, He said Filipinos should be """"bombarded"""" with disaster information, """"They have to get scared, or else,"""" he said, But beyond preparedness, Golez said too many people live close to danger zones like mountainsides or riverbanks, """"They are pushed there because they do not have any choice, If you develop their economy, then they would have more options,"""" he said, Senator Richard Gordon, who heads the Philippine National Red Cross, said better planning is needed, """"We have to break the cycle of disaster and poverty by being smarter, by being sure we can plan our community smarter,"""" he said, """"The big problem here in our country is we don't plan our communities, It's every man for himself,"""" program sets the stage to celebrate our country's most skilled students.

SCHOOL ARTS & LIFE A29L THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2006 BROWNSTEIN This jargon book is sure to leave you LOL CONTINUED FROM A22 Could she be referring to such language as PowerPoint presentations, one of my favourite corporate buzzwords? You bet. In the Beckwith dictionary, this is the definition for bcc: 1) blind carbon copy 2) an option available in email programs that allows people to copy others without the recipient being aware 3) so nasty and passive aggressive; essentially a way of telling on someone, the act of a child who can't handle things on his own 4) can be useful for busting someone who is being a total jerk to you, in which case it's awesome; also a helpful way to tell your boss, Um, can you step in here, because I don't have the authority to rip this person a new one. Thanks. Also special is big picture: 1) overall view of an issue or matter 2) lofty rationalization that managers use to justify their inflated salaries and the need for their direct reports to do all of the actual work on a project; also conveniently relieves them of the responsibility of having to think about details. See also 30,000-foot view. How about hundo? 1) slang: one hundred 2) like one hundred is so hard to say. Dork. Beckwith brings new meaning to the phrase: I'm a people person, which she translates as something often uttered by extremely green job applicants who have no experience in the work world, as anyone who has ever spent time working has learned that most people are intolerable and annoying at best or just plain stupid at worst. Her take on we is priceless, too, and gets right to the crux of it all: 1) pronoun, meaning the speaker and the person or people spoken to 2) you, as in, We really need to make sure this doesn't happen again or We're gonna have to put in some long hours to meet this deadline. Fittingly, the last entry in the dictionary is for Zyban: 1) another antidepressant that might aid in your attempts to not go ballistic and threaten your ability to make mortgage payments. Beckwith's dictionary provides the straight goods. Also, LOL, sorry, """"laughing out loud"""" for those out of the loop. Okay, but Webster's was never this hysterical. bbrownstthegazette.canwest.com Six Quebec films get green light Quebec's film-funding agency has announced that it is helping finance six forthcoming Quebecois films, including a much-anticipated biopic of notorious 1960s Montreal gangster Lucien Rivard. The money to support these films comes from the special one-time grant of $10 million that Culture Minister Line Beauchamp gave film funder SODEC (Societe de developpement des entreprises culturelles) in October following intense lobbying from local producers who complained that they were facing a film-financing crisis. Rivard, the film on the life of the Montreal criminal, will be directed by Charles Biname (The Rocket) and written and produced by Fabienne Larouche and Michel Trudeau. Les Invasions barbares star Remy Girard will play the title role, and the film will be released by Alliance Atlantis Vivafilm. Other films announced on Thursday for SODEC funding are: Serveuses demandées, written and directed by Guylaine Dionne and produced by Kevin Tierney (Bon Cop Bad Cop); Adam's Wall, written by Dana Schoel and directed by Michael Mackenzie; Borderline, based on the novel by Marie-Sissi Labreche and directed by former rock-video director Lyne Charlebois; La ligne dure, directed by Louis Choquette; and Tout est parfait, the feature directorial debut from Yves-Christian Fournier.

The Rise of Taj - a National Lampoon sequel to the entirely forgettable Van Wilder - gets maximum mileage out of the nerd-revenge idea. Despite the built-in misogyny of the National Lampoon shtik, the film even manages to find a quiet charm. Don't get me wrong, this is far from a good movie. But thanks to lead actor Kal Penn (star of Harold and Kumar go to White Castle), The Rise of Taj escapes a head-on collision with good taste and intelligence. Unlike other actors who have worn the geek mantle over the years, Penn refuses to play up the easy nebbish. National Lampoon's Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj Starring: Kal Penn, Lauren Cohan and Daniel Percival Playing at: AMC, Brossard, Cavendish, Colossus, LaSalle cinemas. Parents' guide: Sexual content markers. For instance, he does not wear glasses, flood pants or a bow tie. He's also tall, dark and handsome. Penn has natural screen charisma, and that puts him well ahead of the mouth-breathing pack. Though Penn doesn't have an accent, he's forced to acquire one for the role of Taj because we need some excuse for his outsiderism, and pathetic as it is, racial difference is a no-brainer reason for social alienation in American cinema. In the big picture, this boils down to a formula story about ALLIANCE ATLANTIS Kal Penn (left) is Taj and Ryan Reynolds plays Van Wilder, a group of privileged inbreds duking it with outsiders out for campus superiority. It all begins with Taj and his acceptance letter to Camford University in England. He's told he has been accepted into the exclusive Fox and Hounds fraternity, but when he shows up, he's told it was a typographical error, and is sent to the campus building where the social rejects hang out. Taj makes it his mission to build their self-esteem. Despite the National Lampoon banner - not to mention the gratuitous cleavage shots and visual gags about male arousal - the movie has the surprisingly benign tone of a kids' movie. In fact, it's really little more than a string of juvenile pranks strung together with music, party montages and tepid one-liners. The only thing this movie has going for it is Penn, who proves himself capable of carrying a film on his own shoulders - which may have some shock value in some Hollywood circles, but feels decidedly passe and a little corny in the world of horny youth culture. kmonkcanwest.com",
19990108,modern,rain,"A4 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1999 MONTREAL It was like Sarajevo without bullets A scary drive down to Washington calls to mind the horrors we lived through a year ago When the ice storm last January finally ended, the question everyone asked was: """"How long were you without power?"""" Anyone who had the good fortune not to lose electricity was always quite sheepish about it, and quick to point out that family, friends and even total strangers had been invited over to share the warmth. Anyone who didn't lose power for a minimum of three days was later considered more a spectator than a survivor of the storm. It was a threshold of respectability. If you wanted to share in the experience, you had to have lived through it. At its worst moment, Black Friday, it seemed the infrastructure of Montreal was collapsing, even as the people of the city held themselves together. It was the fourth consecutive day of freezing rain and ice, and army trucks were rolling through the streets of the city. The airports were closed, the metro shut down and bridges off the island were somewhere between treacherous and dangerous. On Ste. Catherine St., merchants closed because they couldn't scan sales. For that matter, they didn't have burglar alarms. Yet there was an almost complete absence of looting, as if it would have been indecent, given the circumstances. It was nearly impossible to get cash, since most ATMs were shut down. Not that you could buy anything, except bottled water, in stores that let people in five at a time. Walking along Ste. Catherine in the icy gloom of that afternoon, I thought Montreal looked like Sarajevo without bullets. A radio station was even knocked off the air that day, when its transmitter buckled under the ice. I'll never forget the ashen look of CJAD program director Steve Kowch as he stood in his darkened master control at the end of a professional day from hell. His storm-central service was off the air, his morning man was on a cruise and his drive host had just quit because management refused to commandeer its FM sister station. Just another day at the office. Until that Friday, most Montrealers had made an attempt to carry on business as usual. On the Thursday, I was finishing chatting with a colleague, Anthony Wilson-Smith, national affairs columnist of Maclean's magazine in Toronto. """"How bad is it?"""" he asked. """"Let's put it this way: I saw a driver help a passenger off the 24 bus on Sherbrooke St."""" """"That sounds really serious,"""" """"So what have you got on the cover next week?"""" """"Alan Eagleson."""" I burst out laughing. """"Of course, if this was happening in Toronto,"""" said Wilson-Smith, a native Montrealer, """"we would be putting out a special issue."""" In the end, Maclean's had the good sense to put the ice storm on the cover, with a picture taken on Wilson Ave., in Notre Dame de Grace, Tony's part of town, and gave him the assignment of writing it against a crazy deadline. There is a saying in golf, local knowledge. When the rain finally stopped on the Saturday morning, people came out of their darkened homes to marvel at the damage and destruction. You weren't even supposed to walk in midtown, a zone of yellow police tape, because of the danger of falling ice. There was the bizarre sight of pedestrians wearing hockey or bicycle helmets, as if they were protection against a sheet of ice falling off a 30-floor office building. For some reason, in my part of town, the lights didn't go off in Westmount Square. Like a lot of people in the neighbourhood, I stood in a darkened window, wondering why they had power and I didn't. It was almost like a scene from a movie. Out the train window, parts of New England looked just as Montreal did a year ago, with trees bent under ice. We finished a rewrite on the spot, as if it was a perfectly normal business day, and got the CEO's sign-off on her speech. We even managed to have a conference call with Toronto, the centre of the universe. Someone at the other end made some impossible demand in a Toronto sort of way, and the CEO barked into the phone: """"I don't think you realize the seriousness of the situation here."""" VIP PARKING SCANDAL Union claims vindication as case dropped PAUL CHERRY and MICHELLE LALONDE The Gazette The union representing the city's Green Onions says its members implicated in the VIP parking scandal have been vindicated because the Crown has dropped its case against them. No fraud charges will be laid against the 75 parking-meter attendants who were suspended by the city last fall. Yesterday, the union's president accused the Bourque administration of blowing a situation city officials supposedly knew about for years out of proportion to generate publicity before the municipal election last November. """"It's what we knew all along,"""" said Daniel Papillon Demers, head of the Montreal municipal employees' union, part of the Canadian Union of Public Employees. """"Our members were not responsible, in either a criminal way or in a way where they should have been disciplined."""" The city handed three-month suspensions to 75 attendants last fall. Through an agreement, the employees were able to return after being off the job for a month. The suspensions are now under arbitration, which the union estimates will end in March. """"What remains is the arbitration concerning the disciplinary actions that were taken against our members,"""" Papillon Demers said. """"We hope we'll come to the same result: that there was no basis for disciplinary action."""" CITY'S OPINION UNCHANGED City executive committee chairman Jean Fortier said the Crown's decision does not change the city's opinion that its employees committed serious professional offences that merited the firings and suspensions. """"The Crown had to decide whether there were grounds for criminal proceedings, but that doesn't change the disciplinary actions we have taken. Regardless of the decision of the Crown, we think there has been a serious breach."""" Vandalism is continuing, fire department contends Conciliation talks between the city of Montreal and its firefighters' union are to resume this morning amid more complaints by the fire department of """"irresponsible"""" pressure tactics. Fuel filters on two fire trucks were punctured Wednesday night and another vehicle has to be repainted to cover graffiti that proved impossible to remove, said Martine Primeau, a spokesman for the fire department. """"These were acts of vandalism on the part of firefighters,"""" she contended. Fire trucks that had been painted a variety of colours and daubed with graffiti as a pressure tactic in the dispute. We almost gave her a standing ovation. In this week for memories of the ice storm, mine were brought back by a scary drive down to Washington last weekend. Freezing rain had turned Interstate 95 between Baltimore and Washington into a skating rink, with dozens of cars in the ditch. Even worse weather was forecast for the next day, and the drive home, after dropping off my daughter with her mother, I remembered driving into the first day of the ice storm in northern New York. Interstate 87 between Pittsburgh and the border was one long parking lot, but I managed to get over to the soft shoulder and off at the last exit. THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1999 A15 WORLD Will 'Sloaney Sophie' be the new Di? ALLIEEN McCAII Southam News LONDON - The British tabloid press is now seriously auditioning Sophie Rhys-Jones for the vacant role of royal superstar. Prince Edward's fiancée needed a police escort to push her way through the phalanx of photographers waiting for her yesterday outside her central London office. And she must have needed half the morning just to scan the reviews of her engagement announcement Wednesday. She made every tabloid front page, save one, and pictures of her and stories about her filled the next seven or eight pages, too. The Daily Mail outdid everyone, however, producing a 12-page """"special souvenir pullout."""" In addition to four full pages of news and photo coverage of the engagement, tabloid circulation fell in Britain after Diana, princess of Wales, died. She was a cover girl whose picture sold newspapers and she has been missed sorely. It is not clear whether she can be replaced. Or whether Rhys-Jones has the """"royal jelly"""" to do it. Royal writer Una-Mary Parker told the BBC that no one could replace Diana - no matter how much the media wanted another royal star. """"(Rhys-Jones) does emulate Diana in many ways with her clothes and her hair, but it is not going to work,"""" Parker said. """"The public won't buy another Diana. There was only one."""" Rhys-Jones doesn't have the young Diana's fairy-tale prospects, either. She's not going to be queen one day. 'Monty' submitted racist plan for Africa Reuter LONDON - Britain's most famous World War II commander, Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery, submitted a racist masterplan for Africa that so embarrassed the postwar government it kept watch on him to ensure he did not repeat his opinions in public. Public records released yesterday reveal that Montgomery - who was revered as a hero for leading British troops to victory over the Germans in North Africa - planned to turn the continent into a white supremacist bulwark against communism. A secret, two-month-long tour of 11 African countries in 1947 led him to conclude that the African """"is a complete savage and is quite unable of developing the country himself,"""" the official papers revealed. His attitude to African independence movements was shown in a recommendation to the government that said, """"We should have no nonsense with the United Nations Organization about Tanganyika; it should be absorbed into the British bosom."""" Tanganyika, which now makes up part of the nation of Tanzania, became independent from Britain in 1961. Montgomery, affectionately dubbed Monty by his troops, was particularly scathing about Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie, whom he called a pathetic figure. """"To give the emperor any more lands would be utterly absurd,"""" he reported. His confidential report was rebuffed by the postwar British Labour government, whose official policy was to build self-government in Africa. TOUR KEPT SECRET Senior ministers were so concerned about the report that Montgomery's lectures were watched to ensure he did not repeat his racist views in public. His African tour was kept secret from all but a handful of top officials. The release of the secret papers under Britain's 50-year rule may tarnish Montgomery's image - glorified in numerous films - as a war hero. Lord Chalfont, a former Labour foreign minister and biographer of Montgomery, said an icon had tumbled. """"A lot of people will find it extremely surprising. His reputation is irredeemably damaged. I find it very disappointing and depressing,"""" Chalfont said. Montgomery's official biographer, Neil Hamilton, said Britain would still remember him as a brilliant strategist, but conceded that in politics he was """"unbelievably naive."""" Hamilton said that Montgomery's description of Africans as savages was """"the kind of schoolboy terminology that Monty used to rally his troops, the equivalent of urging them to hit Rommel for six."""" Montgomery reacted stoically and with humour to the government's rebuttal of his plan, the records show. """"When I wrote my report I was fully aware that you would not agree with it; in fact I said so to my staff! It is obvious that we disagree fundamentally on the whole subject; time will show which of us is right,"""" he said in a letter to the colonial secretary of state at the time, Arthur Creech Jones. Sophie Rhys-Jones is escorted by police as she arrived at work in Mayfair, London, yesterday. Indeed, as some of the less-gushing journalists pointed out, as wife of the queen's third son, she's going to be a rather minor royal. In its editorial, the Guardian commented: """"Numerous precedents suggest that it cannot be an easy thing to marry into the royal family, even at such an inconsequential level. The less she and Edward make of it the better."""" It counseled: """"No pomp, circumstances or PR. No interviews, no street parties, no bunting, no fuss."""" The cheeky tabloids are unlikely to let attitudes like that rain on their parade, particularly if they think they are on to a winner. Certainly the Daily Mail sees potential. Its 12-page pullout featured 49 pictures of Rhys-Jones. It did, however, note that her sense of style still needs work. It made quite a fuss about her fashion """"mistakes"""" in a feature headlined, Can Sloaney Sophie Become a Style Queen? And it deemed the """"round-toed, dumpy-heeled"""" shoes she wore for the engagement photos """"her usual fashion faux pas."""" """"Sloaney"""" is a uniquely British put-down. The reference is to Sloane Square where well-bred ladies who lunch from the horsey set shop in staid stores for timeless fashions. Diana was one of the early Sloane Rangers. She found Versace and grew out of it. Rhys-Jones, with her middle-class background, certainly wasn't born a Sloaney, but even the conservative Telegraph noted that she has adopted the style. It wrote that she sticks to """"Gucci-style pumps with snaffle chains across them, the true sign of the Sloane."""" It is difficult to predict how Rhys-Jones, a sophisticated 33-year-old busy running her own public-relations business, will react to this kind of scrutiny. In the early years, it nearly did in Diana. But there may be sterner stuff at play here. Asked by reporters if she was looking forward to going under the media microscope, Rhys-Jones surprised everyone and replied: """"Yes, I am."""" Mother gets 15 years A Dallas jury sentenced a woman to 15 years in prison for forcing her teenage daughter to have sex with her stepfather to produce a son for the couple.

Oregon plane crash kills 4 Investigators yesterday picked through the wreckage of a twin-engine plane that crashed about 50 kilometres southwest of Portland, Ore., killing all four people aboard and narrowly missing a farmhouse and barn. The six-seat Beechcraft Baron BE-58 went down in the wooded hills of Yamhill County about 6 p.m. Wednesday, said Debbie Taylor, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman in Seattle. The cause of the crash wasn't known. Killer executed in Oklahoma A twice-convicted murderer who said he likely would have killed again had he remained free was executed by injection early yesterday. John Walter Castro Sr., 37, was declared dead at 12:22 a.m. at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. He was the third killer executed in Oklahoma in a month and the 14th since the death penalty was reinstated in 1977. Juries condemned Castro in the unrelated murders of two women, but one death penalty was later overturned. ENGLAND Child-porn suspects in court Eight men accused of distributing thousands of indecent images of children over the Internet appeared in a British court yesterday. The eight were brought before Hastings Magistrates in southern England and were released on bail on condition they return to the court for another hearing on March 5, police said. The men were among a group of more than 40 people arrested in 12 countries last September in what police called the biggest worldwide swoop on pedophiles operating on the Internet. REUTER, AP Union Jack burned South African Muslims protest against Blair visit London Times CAPE TOWN - Hundreds of South African Muslims burned the Union Jack outside the British High Commission in Cape Town yesterday and pledged to disrupt British Prime Minister Tony Blair's visit to the """"Mother City"""" after being dispersed with stun grenades and tear gas. Protesting at the American and British air strikes against Iraq, the demonstrators waved banners and screamed """"One Blair, one bullet,"""" an adaptation of the apartheid-era protest slogan """"One settler, one bullet."""" Police fired tear gas and stun grenades to force the crowd away from the High Commission, which stands opposite the South African Parliament where Blair is due to speak today. The group behind the demonstration, Muslims Against Global Oppression, allegedly took responsibility for the bombing of the Planet Hollywood restaurant in Cape Town shortly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq. THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 8, 1999 Amnesiac has bail hearing Several questions linger about the alleged memory loss of Honeycutt, aka Brighton today MONIQUE BEAUDIN Gazette Crime Reporter The case of Montreal's amnesiac man seems to hinge on one issue: Does he have amnesia, or doesn't he? According to his lawyer and people who befriended him in Montreal, Matthew Honeycutt - or James Edward Brighton, as he's been calling himself for the last three months - has amnesia and doesn't remember anything about his life in Tennessee or crimes he is alleged to have committed before turning up here in October. But Montreal police don't believe he has amnesia, and have charged him with mischief and obstruction of justice for using a false name. The only person who really knows for sure is behind bars at the Rivière des Prairies detention centre, waiting for a bail hearing to be held today. According to his family, Honeycutt has been treated for mental illness. Montreal police said he was treated for schizophrenia. The Montreal General Hospital psychiatry department, where Honeycutt was tested for more than a month and received outpatient treatment, refused for the second day to comment on the case, except for a terse three-sentence statement made public yesterday afternoon. """"Ever since the patient James Brighton, alias Matthew Honeycutt, arrived at the Montreal General Hospital, our purpose has been to provide him with the appropriate care for his clinical presentation,"""" the hospital statement said. """"The recovery of his identity was the priority. We are pleased with the information that has come to light, which hopefully will help in his recovery."""" Psychiatrist Richard Montoro, who treated Honeycutt, did not return calls left by The Gazette at his office yesterday and refused to talk about the case when contacted at home last night. """"I really don't want to speak to you at home,"""" Montoro said, adding that he would discuss the case today. Before Honeycutt's arrest, Montoro told reporters his patient suffered from a rare condition called dissociative amnesia, perhaps caused by a robbery in which he was assaulted by two thieves in his home. Yesterday, Honeycutt's lawyer said Montoro told him Wednesday that Honeycutt's amnesia was not linked to schizophrenia. """"The psychiatry department laughed their heads off on Wednesday,"""" Michel Lussier said. """"Dr. Montoro said Honeycutt did not behave like a schizophrenic."""" A Montreal memory expert said Honeycutt's symptoms sound as if his memory loss is rooted in a psychological disturbance, as opposed to being caused by a brain injury. Someone who has amnesia because of a brain injury retains long-term memory and can remember such information as his own name and the names of his brothers and sisters, but loses short-term memory, cognitive neurologist Howard Chertkow said. """"To forget your own identity - which is something you've known since you were 3 years old - and to have a complete memory loss essentially never occurs due to brain damage,"""" said Chertkow, co-director of the memory clinic at the Jewish General Hospital. Since he turned up in Montreal, Honeycutt, 28, said he believed his name was James Edward Brighton and he was from New Jersey, and began to remember other information: he smoked, he's gay and he had visited Niagara Falls on a family vacation. Honeycutt's case is like """"Hollywood amnesia"""" - in which people wake up one day and can't remember who they are, or any details of their lives, Chertkow said. """"Unlike true amnesiacs, they're able to remember things they've learned since the amnesia began,"""" he said. Honeycutt's memory loss could be a psychological disorder called hysterical paralysis, in which a person suddenly develops numbness, or paralysis. PIERREFONDS SCHOOL TORCHED PETER McCABE, GAZETTE About 500 students are out in the cold after a deliberately set fire destroyed or damaged three classrooms yesterday at École Primaire Murielle Dumont in Pierrefonds. Police said the fire started in three places at 4 a.m., and they are investigating to determine whether burglary was involved. The building is being checked for safety, and students were told to stay home today. FLASHBACK ICE STORM 1998 A YEAR AGO TODAY Over the next few days, The Gazette will run a daily feature on what was happening a year ago at this time. TEMPERATURE: High of minus-3C Low of minus-5 PRECIPITATION: 35.8 millimetres of drizzle and rain. The second round of freezing rain hits. The number of homes without electricity doubles to one million. Three more people - all elderly - die in their powerless homes. A fire kills two; the third dies of hypothermia. Premier Lucien Bouchard agrees to let the army get involved. All trains stop running through Montreal, and hundreds of flights into Dorval are canceled. About 150 shelters are open in ice-ravaged areas. Panic hits the city when the RDI French-language news station wrongly reports that Hydro-Quebec will shut down all power in Montreal at 3 p.m. Many companies send thousands of workers home early. QUOTE OF THE DAY """"We had a warm building and decided to share it with others,"""" said Rev. Eric Maclean, president of Loyola High School in Notre Dame de Grace. like Sarajevo without bullets: MacDonald, Page A4 Ice and snow disasters: Chambers, Page B3 Galleries give best ice-storm shots, Page D1 Full bus service resumes Monday AMANDA JELOWICKI The Gazette The Montreal Urban Community Transit Corp. is ordering mechanical checks and small changes to its entire fleet of 360 low-floor Nova buses, meaning passengers will have to wait until Monday morning for a normal full-service bus schedule. Thirty of the controversial buses were put back into service for yesterday afternoon's rush hour after they underwent a one-hour maintenance inspection. More buses are to be on the road today, but the MUCTC could not specify how many. The 10 bus routes that were canceled are not expected to be operating again until Monday morning. """"We decided to integrate more frequent checks on our buses,"""" said Serge Mathieu, chief of operations at the MUCTC. """"We are investigating every bus. Basically, the bus is a good bus, but it's a new bus, so we just have to check them more frequently."""" The MUCTC said at a press conference yesterday that the low-floor buses would undergo a three-part cleaning before going back on the road. The transit corporation is also taking the added precaution of installing an extra spring to the throttle system to help reduce the buses' deceleration time. The Nova buses were pulled off the road Monday, after the MUCTC driver's union deemed them unsafe and insisted checks be made. On Dec. 31, one driver reported his gas pedal stuck to the floor. Six other incidents were related to deceleration problems, with drivers complaining their buses would not decelerate for about five or six seconds after pressure on the gas pedal was eased. Six buses were taken to a test site in Sainte-Thérèse-de-Blainville, where similar weather conditions were simulated to try to recreate the problems. After four days of testing, MUCTC director-general Jacques Fortin said yesterday, technicians said the incident involving a stuck gas pedal was an isolated event, but the deceleration flaw was resolved. """"The problem of the delay was fixed,"""" Fortin said. """"The delay is very short; we're not talking about five seconds. Even with the deceleration problem, the buses are still safe. But we wanted the time reduced."""" Dennis Tallon, president and chief executive officer of Nova Bus Corp., said the addition of the extra spring will reduce the decelerators' response time by about 0.2 seconds. He said in extreme weather conditions, response time will be reduced to 2.6 seconds from 2.8 (the time it takes to start slowing the bus), and in normal conditions to 0.6 seconds from 0.8. """"The added spring is being implemented at the MUCTC's discretion. It's something we're recommending to other transit authorities to do."""" The three-part cleaning procedure includes cleaning the acceleration-deceleration linkage, checking the control valve's pressure and inspecting the pneumatic system. Tallon insisted the Nova buses are safe for passengers to use, and said that if there was a significant problem, """"they would not be on the road."""" or amnesia with no physiological explanation. """"It's a defense,"""" Chertkow said. """"It's a way of dealing with stress or anxiety or fears, usually seen in people with quite severe disturbances of personality."""" Police investigators are trying to piece together what happened between Oct. 8, when Honeycutt was last seen in Tennessee, and Oct. 12, when he showed up at a Park Ave. hotel, telling a night clerk he had just woken up naked near an Old Montreal garbage bin. In Tennessee, police officials have been trying to find Honeycutt since he apparently sneaked out a back window of his mother's home on Oct. 8, after allegedly using his brother's ID to obtain a fake driver's license and buy a car. Detective Jim Albanese, a fraud investigator with the Knox County Sheriff's Department, said Kevin Honeycutt filed a police report contending his brother had used his credit cards, got a $1,221.80 loan from a credit company in his name, tried to rent an apartment under Kevin's name and got a fake driver's license that he used to buy a car in Kevin Honeycutt's name. """"(Kevin) got in touch with his brother, whose attitude was that some third person had committed the fraud,"""" Albanese said, adding that the two men were supposed to go to the car dealership to straighten things out when Matthew Honeycutt disappeared. No doubt about it 'Fill-in Mom' absolutely believes mystery man Gisela Maier has never met Matthew Honeycutt. It was """"James Brighton"""" she knew; or thought she knew - that engaging lost soul she befriended and welcomed into her Hudson home. On Wednesday, Montreal Urban Community police said her 28-year-old protege was an imposter, charged with mischief and wanted for fraud and forgery in his native Tennessee. Relatives, co-workers and former lovers who watched Tuesday's broadcast of Hard Copy identified him as Honeycutt, a gay man who suffers from schizophrenia and who vanished Oct. 8, after using his brother's social-security card to get a fake driver's license and buy a car. Yet Marler said yesterday she still believes """"absolutely"""" the story he told when he was admitted to the Montreal General Hospital 12 weeks ago, apparently suffering from dissociative amnesia. """"He is no criminal. Whatever he did, he did in a state over which he had no control. Was it really necessary to have four police officers come in the middle of the night to put shackles on him? This guy is a good human being."""" There was no sense ever that he was dangerous,"""" said Bruce Walsh, co-ordinator of the Gay Line information service, who helped launch the international search to track down the mystery man's family. Like Marler, who first contacted The Gazette, and Gregg Blachford, a Gay Line volunteer who offered Honeycutt a place to stay when he was released from the hospital, Walsh says he believes the man they called James Brighton was """"too consistent"""" to have been playing an elaborate con game. """"James allowed me to read parts of his journal,"""" Walsh said. """"It's a horrible tale of no identity, desperation and loneliness."""" At first, Walsh was understandably wary of Honeycutt, who claimed he had woken up naked beside a garbage bin in a downtown parking lot Oct. 12, yet had no idea how he had got there. He said he dressed in clothes he found strewn nearby and wandered the streets until he reached the Quality Hotel on Park Ave., where he told his story to night auditor Marc Dagenais. """"It was the first time I had seen somebody this lost. He was not faking,"""" Hotel auditor Marc Dagenais PEGGY CURRAN """"He looked very nervous and his hands were shaking,"""" Dagenais recalled in late November. """"He was white as a ghost."""" Dagenais said Honeycutt asked the way to the hospital but didn't understand his directions. """"Then I asked his name. He responded nervously, 'Hap Hip I.""""""",
19980912,modern,rain,"I: Record floods The calamitous flooding across a vast area of the Indian subcontinent became more dire as monsoon rains battered the region and caused overflowing rivers to engulf areas previously unaffected by the worst summer flooding in history. Swollen rivers across eastern India and Bangladesh were still rising and posing even further threats to millions of residents weary of more than two months of incessant inundations. The massive floods have inflicted an appalling amount of damage across both countries, where more than 14 million people have been displaced by rising waters. Although floods regularly ravage the region, this year they have swamped vast areas far from the usual courses of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers and their tributaries. Earthquakes Several regions of southern Italy were rocked Wednesday afternoon by a powerful temblor that killed two people and damaged numerous buildings. The quake struck near the regional capital of Potenza and was felt from Naples to Calabria at the southern tip of the mainland. In an otherwise quiet week for worldwide seismic activity, earth movements were also felt in northeastern China and Taiwan. Tropical storms Torrential rains and severe thunderstorms associated with developing tropical storm Javier unleashed flash flooding across southern Mexico on Tuesday that killed at least 31 people. Swollen rivers churning with mud and debris swept away houses, bridges and huge trees from Chiapas state in the south to Campeche along the Gulf Coast. Tropical storm Frances drenched the Texas coast with more than 12 centimeters of rainfall. Saudi water crisis Summertime temperatures soaring to almost 50C during the previous week along the Red Sea have caused a water shortage in the Saudi port of Jeddah. Prince Me-shaal ibn Majed ibn Abdel Aziz, governor of Jeddah province, called on the population to limit consumption, but said the water crisis might be almost over. Families in the city have been without running water for up to two weeks. Eruptions White Island Volcano in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty quieted down following several days in which eruptions made the island look like it was hit by a nuclear bomb, according to one tour boat operator. In Mexico, Popocatepetl produced another smoky eruption that sent a plume of ash soaring high above the suburbs of Mexico City. The Stromboli volcano, located just north of Sicily, caused tourists to scurry down its slopes to safety as an exploding lava dome produced a rain of incandescent rocks over the volcanic island. Monarch threat Poisonous caterpillars in an important preserve for the migrating monarch butterfly in west-central Mexico threaten to destroy part of the winter habitat of the distinctive butterflies. The plague began more than a month ago and has affected about 1,500 trees along the border between the states of Michoacan and Mexico, where the monarchs are due to arrive next month. Nearly 20 percent of the trees in the preserve have already been killed. The environment ministry plans to fumigate the forests before the butterflies arrive and to replant the affected trees. Monkey raids Singapore residents are complaining to officials about an increased number of attacks by marauding monkeys, which are breaking into condominiums and trashing kitchens. """"I am very worried for the children, because the monkeys don't seem to be afraid of humans,"""" Kimberly Brenner told the Straits Times. She recently had to fight off two monkeys that had invaded her balcony, while other residents in her 400-unit complex said the troublesome primates swing from windows and even show up in bedrooms. National Parks officials told reporters that the monkeys are probably living in a nearby forest and venture into the residential areas in search of easy food. The problem is probably being aggravated by some residents intentionally feeding the animals. A new map called Eco-Montreal is designed to make the city as livable as possible, as well as provide geographical and geological information. MARK ABLEY The Gazette Maps show us where to go. They prevent us from getting lost. They enable us to plan with confidence. These are truisms. But not all maps have the same goal. Some maps aim to educate; a few even aim to transform. Such maps assume that we are lost, that we don't know where to go, that we can no longer plan with confidence. Such maps hope to change our lives. One such map appeared this year in Montreal. It's called Eco-Montreal, and it's available in both a small-scale paper format and a more detailed version online. The creators of the map are affiliated with the School of Urban Planning at McGill University and are environmental idealists. """"The mapping is really a tool for citizens,"""" says Douglas Jack, the coordinator of the Eco-Montreal map. """"It's a means of layering a lot of different kinds of information - something that people across a whole range of disciplines can use."""" On their bilingual website, Jack and his colleagues express the desire to """"encourage a new vision."""" A vision of an economically sound, ecologically sustainable future in a livable city. """"Such a vision must transcend politics, language and traditional planning. It must be grounded in respect and knowledge of the bioregion, people, cultures and diversity of species that share this place with us. This vision can only come from the people that call this place home."""" That mention of """"the bioregion"""" is key. Behind the Eco-Montreal map lies a belief that the solutions to many of our problems must be locally based - that loyalty to the region we call home should take precedence over the more usual loyalties and enmities that fill our front pages. This belief is either very old-fashioned or very avant-garde; possibly both. As you scroll and click your way down the computer version of the map, some fascinating bits of information spring to life. In the event of a serious earthquake, it appears, you'd be better off living on Ile Perrot than in Laval. There are no fault lines crossing Ile Perrot, but no fewer than five cross Ile Jesus. A detailed geological map shows, too, that Montreal Island is built mainly on limestone, shale and dolomite. The geology a few miles west is entirely different: by the time you reach Hudson, you're standing on the gneiss and quartzite of the Grenville and Morin formation. But the map also shows what we have made of our inbuilt geology and geography: the patterns of sewage discharge, the toxic chemical sites and refuse dumps. """"We'd like to add more detail in terms of people's own back yards,"""" says Jim Banks, president of the map's sponsor, the Sustainable Development Association. """"We also want to raise the level of discussion at a civic level. The basic question behind it all is this: 'How can we go about making this a better place to live?'"""" While they want you to think locally, the mapmakers are also thinking globally. Their website is linked to a fast-growing worldwide network of Green Maps. A few more clicks can take you into electronic versions, or visions, of places from Copenhagen to San Francisco, Adelaide to Kyoto (where special icons identify the best vantage points for fireflies and cherry blossoms, not to mention the preferred habitat of the white-cheeked giant flying squirrel). """"The power of maps is certainly on the upswing,"""" says Wendy Brawer, director of Modern World Design in New York and a pioneer in the eco-map movement. """"Not only are they important for the discovery of new places, but also for their ability to change people's perceptions about a place."""" Brawer played a large role in designing the Green Apple Map - an inspiration for many other cities around the world. She emphasizes that green maps enable a lot of micro-ventures to join together in some larger sense of community: """"New York covers 321 square miles, so we've got a lot of everything. Through the map, we can see a lot of the small projects as part of an interconnected whole."""" Like so much that the Internet offers, however, the green map of Montreal needs to be taken with a few grains of salt. Its information, both visual and verbal, is imperfect. The map of water aimed at helping people make their ecologically and economically sound choices reveals significant differences between the St. Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers - but it neglects to explain the units of measurement, leaving a viewer uncertain what the different colors mean. Jack is sensitive to criticisms of the Eco-Montreal map, some coming from environmentalists who have lamented the absence of various possible entries. """"Nine thousand hours of volunteer labor have gone into this,"""" he says. """"But in the environmental movement, I think we've been so critically focused on trying to stop the bad guys that even when people are doing good things, our first impulse is to attack."""" The Montreal map's list of """"green businesses and services"""" includes many firms that specialize in soil analysis, water treatment, decontamination and the like. But it also includes the corporate giant SNC-Lavalin - a company that has engineering projects in about 100 countries, and that carried out a feasibility study for China prior to work on the controversial Three Gorges Dam. Is its inclusion unfair? Hard to say. For SNC-Lavalin has also helped to create rapid-transit systems that are environmentally healthy. No clear standards exist on how to define """"green;"""" no consensus exists on where to lavish praise. """"The business issue is the toughest for all of us mapmakers,"""" admits Brawer in New York. """"You can say that everything represents a different shade of green."""" Despite the promise of green maps, it's debatable whether they really have the transformative potential that enthusiasts like Banks and Jack believe. John Tromp, a research scientist in McGill University's department of chemistry, was involved with the Eco-Montreal map at an early stage. A veteran of the Green Party and the Sustainable Development Association, Tromp says that the nagging question behind much of his activism has been, """"What can we do that's effective?"""" The green map is a good idea, he says. But it has not fulfilled all his hopes. Perhaps the hopes themselves were exaggerated? Tromp has gone back to the grassroots - literally. Today, his environmental activism takes the form of helping to run his local community garden. Wendy Gorchinsky is active in a community garden, too. She also teaches composting, sells organic food, distributes fairly traded coffee - and, with two like-minded colleagues, spent the summer working on a detailed eco-map of Notre Dame de Grace under the auspices of the NDG Community Council. The map, which should be ready by the end of October, will highlight about 35 businesses in the district that promote social justice or sound environmental practices. """"We want to build a sense of community pride in NDG,"""" Gorchinsky explains. """"There's a high concentration of these businesses here, and the public doesn't know about a lot of them. Of course, we also hope that the map will encourage other businesses to do the same thing."""" The NDG map is the most advanced in a series of micro-maps that Jack is keen to encourage. Mapping groups are active, he says, in Kahnawake, Vaudreuil, Pointe Claire and elsewhere. Their work may ultimately feed and enrich the larger map of Eco-Montreal. An example of the map's potential can be glimpsed from what happened in a literature class at John Abbott College this year. The students had been reading different versions of Utopia. Their teacher, Patricia Gordon, wanted """"to bring the issues down to our own locality, and have them imaginatively revisit the island of Montreal."""" Gordon asked the students to buy the paper version of the Eco-Montreal map. """"Then, as well as the creative writing, they had to redraw the map to match their vision."""" Some of the results were, in Gordon's term, """"magnificent."""" They revealed a keen sense of the city, not just in terms of its problems but also its possibilities. Gordon is now thinking about using the map in a wholly different course. """"I think it has a tremendously powerful use,"""" she concludes, """"and not just for nitty-gritty scientific stuff.""""

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT Dolly Parton - Hungry Again evokes her beginnings and proves she's one of country music's best singer-songwriters. THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1998 DOLLY PARTON - Hungry Again Ddcca/Universal INFO-LINE: 738-8600, CODE 8001 When she wants to be, Dolly Parton is one of country music's great singer-songwriters. Some of her early hits, """"Tennessee Mountain Home,"""" """"Jolene"""" and """"Coat of Many Colors,"""" remain timeless classics. Unfortunately, maybe two decades ago, Parton the artist lost out to Parton the larger-than-life personality. Since then, so much of what she's released has been ordinary and very forgettable; to the point that Parton herself now says she """"needed to write and sing like I was hungry again."""" """"Hungry Again"""" is one of the best records of Parton's career. Certainly, it's the best thing she's done since """"Trio,"""" her 1987 collaboration with Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris. As the title implies, Parton is again writing songs and singing them with the conviction of an artist with an innate need - rather than a contractual obligation - to express herself. Oprah starts 13th season on high note RICHARD HUFF New York Daily News NEW YORK - Amid declining ratings and a fall from her decade-plus perch as the top-rated daytime show, Oprah Winfrey kicked off her new season Tuesday with a new set, new theme music and a renewed vow to use TV in a positive way. Winfrey told viewers that after watching television this summer, she had seen inspired to go in """"the opposite direction of down the tubes,"""" and wants her show's 13th season to """"raise ourselves to the highest vision possible for our lives and those of you watching."""" Appearing in a long black dress on a set highlighted by candles and warm colors, Winfrey said the television world was getting """"stoop to sleaze,"""" """"crazier"""" and that she wanted """"to try to do TV that inspires us to make positive changes in our lives."""" The multiple Emmy-winner said there are shows on the air that are """"like mental poison,"""" adding, """"I ain't mentioning no names."""" She didn't need to. She was clearly alluding to The Jerry Springer Show, which last February - fueled by in-show fisticuffs - became the first program in more than a decade to unseat Winfrey from the top of the Nielsen ladder. Winfrey reaffirmed her vow not to stoop to the lowest common denominator. She's given her show a """"Change Your Life"""" title and intends to offer a series of appearances by self-help gurus. During Tuesday's show, which also included an appearance by soon-to-be-talk-show-host Roseanne, Winfrey gave viewers a glimpse of how she relaxes, complete with shots of her taking a bubble bath. """"Unlike every other show, hers has the most variety,"""" said Dick Kurlander of Petry Television, a company that advises stations on program choices. Of all talk-show hosts, he said, """"she is the broadest by far."""" Kurlander said Winfrey can comfortably remain in second place and still finish far ahead of Springer in quality.

MOLLIE O'BRIEN Big Red Sun Sugar Hill/Koch INFO-LINE: 738-8600, CODE 8002 Some of Nashville's superstars have proven time and again that it's easy to make insignificant albums with huge budgets. The antithesis, as Mollie O'Brien has proved before and does again on """"Big Red Sun,"""" is that it's also possible to make great albums on a small budget. O'Brien, like her brother Tim (with whom she's recorded several albums of duets), has a great voice with a natural sense of phrasing. She also knows how to pick strong material and the taste to not drown it in overproduction. Although her roots in traditional country music always shine through, there's a blues base to many of the songs that O'Brien has chosen for this disc. Some of them, like Memphis Minnie's """"In My Girlish Days"""" or Willie Dixon's """"Little Baby,"""" are from the classic blues repertoire. Others, like Steve Goodman's """"Looking for Trouble"""" or Randy Newman's """"Rollin',"""" capture the spirit of the blues. On the traditional """"Gambling Man,"""" O'Brien proves that she can tingle spines with the best of them and she turns in a spectacular Cajun-inflected version of Lucinda Williams's """"Big Red Sun Blues."""" 98V-5556 691: Garage Sales BAIE D'URFE 33 Oxford Road, Sept 12, rain day Sept 19, 9-4pm, Many interesting items, IBM 486 computer with color printer, Thomas organ, exercise equipment, stereo, electric snowblower & numerous household items.

OUTINGS 400,000 visitors are expected to crowd Saint-Tite for bucking broncos, dancing, parades and music when cowboys turn the town into the biggest western rodeo in eastern Canada meets west. THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1998 East MICHELLE GAGNON Special to The Gazette Linda Faucher and Luc Gauthier are getting married today. But it's not a private affair. At least 2,000 people will be there. Their wedding is one of today's main events at Saint-Tite's 31st annual Western Festival. """"I always told myself that if I got married, I'd do it at the festival,"""" Faucher said. """"We've been going for 10 years. We love western music, horses, the ambiance, everything."""" Faucher and Gauthier are not alone. Another 400,000 like-minded visitors are expected at the 10-day festival that started yesterday. Saint-Tite's Western Festival is one of Quebec's five largest festivals. With offerings as diverse as line-dancing lessons, two-step showdowns, a horse-drawn parade and country bands all day, every day, it's no surprise it's so popular. But in recent years, the rodeo has been the key attraction. """"This is the biggest rodeo in Quebec, and the second in Canada after the Calgary Stampede,"""" said festival spokesman Guy Berthiaume. """"We don't have the Stampede's prestige, but we've been improving the quality of the competitions by importing better livestock."""" Better beasts mean a bigger challenge, and that means more cowboys from other provinces and the United States stiffening the competition for Quebec cowboys. """"This is the rodeo of the year for us,"""" said Benoit Gauthier, a festival veteran since 1980 and three-time winner of the pickup race. """"It's the end of the season. The horses are in top shape, and so is the competition."""" The scenery on the way there shouldn't be too bad, either. Saint-Tite, located just north of Trois-Rivières, is a small town of 4,000 people. It sits in a picturesque region where the steep, craggy landscapes of the North Shore meet the Laurentians. So untouched is it that its rolling hills have figured as the bucolic backdrop for such celebrated Quebecois tele-romans as Les Filles de Caleb and Marguerite Volant. And just as the region is used for such historical fiction, the western festival is a result of the region's history. Traditionally, the town was the center of Quebec's leather industries. In 1967, cowboy boot makers G.A. Boulet ran a one-day rodeo as an advertising campaign. The company converted the town's baseball field into a ring, and although rain fell over the field all day, no one could be driven away. Today, the festival has its own bleachers, and represents revenues of $5 million for the town and $15 million for the region. But probably the best symbol of its size can be seen during the opening ceremony when Saint-Tite's mayor hands the keys to the city to the festival's president. """"The town doesn't exist once the festival starts,"""" Berthiaume said. This is what gives the fest all its allure. """"I've been to rodeos in all 48 continental states, and Saint-Tite is probably my favorite rodeo in the world,"""" said Jason Runfola, a 24-year-old professional rodeo rider from Tennessee. """"You take a small town and cram thousands of people in there. It makes for a real positive, fun, happy atmosphere."""" When you drive into town, everyone has their Christmas lights on, and you can feel everyone's behind it. That's special. Today's main event, the Extreme Rodeo, starts at 1:30 pm and features bucking broncos, wild horses, calf ropings, and pickup races. Country dancing competitions run from 6 to 8 pm, when a show by the US country music band Bl",

Would we be ready this time? We should, 10 years along, be able to respond with a resounding Yes But we can't Take the most serious of all the problems from 1998, the near-catastrophe of running out of drinking water At the time, power for the production of tap water was not among Hydro-Quebec's top priorities It came in the second tier But after the storm, drinking water became the leader among Hydro-Quebec's top priorities, Montreal's director of drinkable water production told the Journal de Montreal But there's still no secure independent source of power for the city's two main water filtration facilities, Atwater and Desbaillets Rolls-Royce, with the help of the provincial government, built a 50-megawatt electricity generator designed to supply electricity to the filtration plants But that generator is still not independently capable of powering the two plants The city insists the situation will be corrected as soon as underground electrical cables are laid - in 2010 This isn't good enough It is a shock the most serious of the problems that came to light in the ice storm is still not completely corrected Across the province, it also became clear municipalities of all sizes were woefully unprepared to deal with a major disruption, never mind a full-blown crisis Too many towns and cities were found to have no emergency plan at all As a result, in 2001 the Quebec government ordered municipalities to draw up emergency plans capable of coping with disasters It was a popular move The government that issues such an order looks as though it is really taking charge But Quebec provided no money for preparing such plans This kind of """"unfunded mandate"""" is not always quickly and fully obeyed by hard-pressed cities, to put it mildly The result? One in five Quebec municipalities still has no master emergency plan in place With or without funding, after 10 years this is irresponsible We should be able, on this 10th anniversary of the country's worst natural disaster, to look back secure in the knowledge that everything has been done to make sure we are safer than we were then But we can't and there is no excuse for this THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 5, 2008 FROZEN IN TIME What stands out for many is how the experience shaped us, challenging our perceptions of ourselves and our colleagues, our capacity for kindness THE ICE STORM CHANGED US ALL Story by PEGGY CURRAN The Gazette WHEN IT WAS OVER, when all the houses were warm again, when it was safe once more to turn on the Christmas lights and shower for more than a minute, when fresh cords of wood were stacked to dry by the shed, we were different It wasn't simply that the landscape had changed, that the maples had cracked and fir trees had snapped and apple trees would sprout when they were supposed to bloom - although that was true, too It wasn't that the 92-year-old twins were rescued and the miracle baby was safely home and the wedding guests actually made it through the ice and snow to see the perennial bachelor marry his Russian bride It wasn't even those recurring nightmares of another bleak midwinter spent in a dormitory filled with 200 restless strangers, or that instinctive flinch whenever rain starts to crackle or icicles go forth and multiply When Montrealers talk about our dark, shivery, Dr Zhivago moment on the brink of the unknown - a few days for some, several sodden and stinky weeks for others - we remember cold nights and candles, layers of sweaters and marathon Scrabble games and the tinny sound of news bulletins on a transistor radio We take pride in our pioneering spirit and rugged ingenuity Yet what shines through for many is how the experience shaped us, challenging our perceptions of ourselves and our colleagues, our capacity for kindness and stamina, our ability to appreciate everyday heroes in our midst and even reimagine the way we live our lives This was no tsunami, no Katrina, no 911 Horrible and harrowing as it was while it lasted, claiming 35 lives and costing billions of dollars, for most of us, the impact of the ice storm of January 1998 was fleeting And yet for many, especially those on the front lines, it forever shifted their sense of community and even how the world is supposed to work """"This is a project I started with friends after the ice storm, because of the ice storm,"""" said Jason Hughes, director of Coop La Maison Verte in Notre Dame de Grace, where members can buy fair trade coffee and phosphate-free detergent while looking for ways to build a better planet """"The ice storm really changed my life You really saw how fragile things were, and yet how people could come together and do remarkable things"""" In January 1998, Hughes was coordinator for the N.G. resident Lillian Bradley Foster, who spent the ice storm looking out for the elderly, says: """"I would like to think that the whole city is a little bit more aware that people live in isolation But have we really moved ahead great leaps and bounds?"""" GAZETTE the crisis was over, the memory with citizens was very positive Leclerc and Parker can't help seeing parallels between the way Montrealers reacted during the ice storm and during the shooting rampage at Dawson College last year, when students found sanctuary in nearby shops, Concordia University opened its doors and a women's shelter made sandwiches """"Whenever there is a crisis like that, Montrealers help everybody That's the bottom line,"""" Parker said """"I think the people who lived through it were the wiser For that little time, you forgot all your other problems You had this thing to worry about, and the family And I think it really did bring everybody closer """"Everyone should go through something like that once in their life,"""" said Robert Lortie, 55, who retired last month as chief of operations at Concordia University's Sir George Williams campus Ten years ago, he was co-ordinator at Loyola when the ice storm toppled trees and blacked out the west-end campus for two weeks """"It's the best experience I had at Concordia,"""" Lortie said """"That's when you learn the capacity and the imagination of your employees - how far they can go and how dedicated they are, who has the big Concordia sign on his chest It was really a very good experience, something that changes you forever"""" Ten years on, there's little evidence Thomson's Orchards in St Paul d'Abbotsford suffered any lasting damage from the ice storm About five per cent of Thomson's 30,000 trees were completely destroyed, while thousands more young trees required radical pruning and restructuring, which set crop production back for two or three years Today, the farm Dean Thomson's great-grandfather founded shortly after the First World War has expanded dramatically, with more than 100,000 trees growing 15 varieties of apples on 200 acres Still, it doesn't take much to jog Thomson's memory, whether it's the click-click of freezing rain hitting the window on a dreary morning or a glimpse at the mounds of dead maples rotting in the glen at the bottom of their property """"There were so many that in the spring after the storm, we went to try and clean it up, but it was impossible I don't even go down there anymore, it's too depressing It used to be this bucolic spot where you could ski under the trees Now it's just a bunch of old sticks """"Yes, it will come back, but not in my time Maybe in 60 years Right now, it just looks as if something has been demolished It's like losing old friends It was someplace that was special, and now it's not"""" Yet he retains some remarkably positive memories of those 3 weeks when the whole family bunked together in his parents' three-bedroom house, waiting for Hydro-Quebec to rebuild the South Shore grid """"It made you realize how the life we lead is way too fast"""" He credits Hydro crews, aided by reinforcements from the Maritimes and the northeastern United States, with getting the job done in the bitter cold that descended almost as soon as the rain stopped """"It was midnight and minus 20 Celsius, minus 30 with the wind chill, and this hydro team from New Brunswick was working around the clock You would hear people complaining about people being paid triple time, but I figure anyone who was out there at minus 30 in the middle of the night restoring electricity deserved what they got"""" Barry and Ora Beloff now have three children - Samantha, 9, Brooke, 8, and Spencer, 5 - to show for the Jan 18 wedding they once feared would be hijacked by the ice storm, the blackout and 100 strangers who had been camping at the synagogue """"I'm an emotional guy to begin with, but I remember walking down the aisle, being more emotional than usual, thinking, 'We got through this' You heard of people dying or having to go to the hospital I remember feeling very blessed It was a very spiritual night"""" At 3 a.m. that morning, when the guests had gone home, the newlyweds stopped at the Westmount Lookout where Beloff had proposed two months earlier """"We were just looking at the city and this magnificent vast beauty of lights and ice and saying look what we've been through in 60 days and it sort of worked out pretty well"""" Russ Williams spent 15 years as a member of the National Assembly for the West Island constituency of Nelligan, where he racked up fairly embarrassing majorities, even for a West Island Liberal Still, Williams never felt the love quite as intensely as he did during the ice storm, when he went glad-handing with a portable generator, a six-pack and a bag of potato chips """"I felt like Santa Claus going around giving everyone juice,"""" Williams says of those days and nights he and neighbour Len McDougall spent spreading joy - but mostly heat - to folks in Beaconsfield and beyond Ten days later, when the worst was over for Montreal, McDougall shipped his generator off to a family friend in St Jean sur Richelieu, where power wouldn't be back up for a few more weeks Williams, now president of an agency that represents research-intensive pharmaceutical companies, still has his generator stored in his Ottawa garage """"I turn it on every month or so, just to make sure it still works in case I ever need it again"""" He likes to think he launched his neighbourhood patrol not because he was a politician but because he could """"There was this sense of vulnerability, that the situation was out of your control The ice storm really showed us the power of Mother Nature and who was really in charge"""" But that was later, something we were going to have to discover for ourselves, the hard way.

You'd better read this LUKE BAKER REUTERS London - If your mouldies are giving you the cringe then perhaps it's time you bought them this totally nangbook. A 13-year-old English schoolgirl has had a surprise publishing hit with The A-Z of Teen Talk, a dictionary of teenage slang that's proving popular with parents and children alike. With definitions for words such as """"fudge"""" (a really stupid person), """"nang"""" (cool) and """"mouldies"""" (parents), the dictionary appears to be helping out-of-touch parents recommunicate with their lingo-obsessed offspring. """"It sort of helps bridge the gap,"""" said Ingrid Parris of Ravette, the publishing house that picked up the book, sent in as an unsolicited manuscript by Lucy van Amerongen, a schoolgirl still sporting a """"tin-grin"""" (someone who wears braces). """"Teenage language is becoming more and more impenetrable, so adults who use some of these words might find they get more respect from their children."""" Van Amerongen came up with the idea after her parents complained they couldn't understand what she and her sisters, age 11 and 23, were saying to one another. She decided to ask friends at her private boarding school to come up with their best slang suggestions, which she then compiled into a 40-page book. The publisher made an initial print run of 5,000 copies, but the mini-dictionary proved such a success in the run up to Christmas that a reprint of 6,000 is already on the cards. As with many things teenage these days, several words owe their origin to mobile phones and text messaging, such as """"book,"""" a synonym for cool which comes from the fact if you try to text """"cool"""" it comes up first as """"book."""" Others trace their roots to TV programs or are offshoots of American slang, while some are particularly English, such as """"ledge,"""" which means someone who is greatly admired - a legend. Here's a selection of words and their definitions: Clappin - out of date Phat-free - uncool, rubbish Shizzle - someone you really admire, as in """"she's a shiz"""" Cratz - Thanks Hench - a tough boy, as in a henchman Cringe - embarrassment, as in """"your parents are a cringe"""" Antwacky - unstylish or old-fashioned Cotch down - hang out, chill out or sleep Klingon - younger children, like irritating young brothers Flat roofin' - overworked at school, stressed Za - abbreviation for pizza Fudge - a really stupid person, derived from the grades they might be expected to get in their exams - F, U, D, G, E Zep - a yob or lower class person Oudish - very cool, excellent Starting January 14, VIA will add a new, early-afternoon departure in each direction to its Montreal-Ottawa route.

Britney loses rights to see sons Court ruling after she's taken to hospital in hysterics JILL SERJEANT REUTERS Los Angeles - A family court yesterday suspended Britney Spears's visiting rights to her two young sons after the pop star was hospitalized in a fit of hysterics over their handover to ex-husband Kevin Federline. The Los Angeles court commissioner handling the bitter custody dispute between Spears and Federline suspended the pop star's visiting rights at an emergency hearing, a court document showed. The document, first obtained by celebrity website TMZ.com, said Spears' visitation with the minor children is suspended pending further order of the court. It added Federline was awarded """"sole legal and physical custody"""" of the boys. The order is in effect until Jan. 14. The court order was issued as Spears, 26, spent the day in a Los Angeles hospital, apparently under mental evaluation. She lost custody of the boys in October last year but had been allowed court-monitored visits three times a week. But at the end of their visit on Thursday night, police were called to her Los Angeles home when she refused to hand the boys back to Federline's representatives. Television pictures showed Spears being taken out of her house strapped to a gurney and driven to Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in an ambulance after a four-hour standoff in which the pop singer reportedly locked herself in a bathroom. Los Angeles police spokesperson Jason Lee said Spears was under the influence of an unknown substance and was being detained and evaluated in the hospital. Us magazine, citing a source at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre, said Spears had been designated a """"special needs"""" patient and was under constant watch. Another source told Us magazine that in the ambulance Spears had to be restrained like a mental patient and she """"was going between laughing and hysterics."""" Spears lost primary custody of Sean Preston, 2, and Jayden James, one, to Federline after her life spun out of control following their divorce, her stints in rehab, a bizarre head-shaving episode and reports of drinking and drug use. She is currently undergoing court-ordered random drug and alcohol tests and parenting lessons. Plane down in sea Caracas - A plane carrying 14 people, including eight Italians and one Swiss passenger, crashed into the sea close to a group of Venezuelan islands yesterday and had not yet been found. Rescue workers in speed boats and helicopters were still searching for the twin-engine aircraft nearly 10 hours after it went down. The officials said the pilot reported engine problems just before contact was lost with the Czech-made 19-seat LET L-410. The plane was flying to the Los Roques archipelago from Caracas but reported engine trouble and never arrived at its destination, an air rescue worker said. Rain and strong waves have """"made the search for the plane more difficult,"""" said General Antonio Rivero, who heads Venezuela's civil protection agency.

D6 SPORTS I WEATHER I THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 5, 2008 TENNIS ROUNDUP Hingis slapped with 2-year doping ban TESTS FOR COCAINE Retired Swiss Miss denies using drug AGENCE-FRANCE PRESSE London - Former world No. 1 women's player Martina Hingis has been barred for two years after failing a doping test, the International Tennis Federation announced yesterday. Hingis tested positive for cocaine on June 29 at Wimbledon and although the Swiss player denied she had taken the drug, an independent Anti-Doping Tribunal found, after a two-day hearing, that she had committed an offence. The two-year ban is effective from Oct. 1, but the 27-year-old Hingis has already announced her retirement. The ITF said in a statement """"The Tribunal rejected the suggestion made on behalf of Ms. Hingis that there were doubts about the identity and or integrity of the sample attributed to her."""" Hingis's results from Wimbledon, where she reached the third round, and subsequent events last year have been wiped out and she has been ordered to repay $129,481 in prize money. She has three weeks to appeal the decision. Nadal faces Moya in Chennai Open semis: World No. 2 Rafael Nadal eased into the semifinals of the ATP Chennai Open in India, setting up a duel with Spanish compatriot Carlos Moya.

Buckley might be the best go-to guy in Canadian university basketball Buckley struck for six straight points during the final four minutes, including a two-point field goal with seven seconds left, as the No 3-ranked Stingers held off a tough Bishop's Gaiters squad 72-70 at Concordia Gym last night as play in the Quebec men's basketball league resumed following a month-long break Buckley finished the game with 23 points and 10 assists for the double-double as the Stingers improved to 4-1, while handing the Gaiters (2-3) a two-point loss for the second time in two games between the teams this season """"Damian Buckley took that game over like he does most of the time,"""" Bishop's head coach Eddie Pomykala said """"I can take Damian Buckley taking that shot at the end It was contested, but that's a great player making a great play at the right time"""" The third-year point guard's play was magical as he shouldered the burden of a team hit with injuries to fourth-year veterans centre Jamal Gallier (ankle), and forward Dwayne Buckley (knee), Damian's older brother, who has been sidelined most of the season and remains out indefinitely Without Damian Buckley's play, Stingers head coach John Dore might have held his nose all the way into his team's dressing room, not just down the hall leading to it, indicating the Stingers' performance overall after returning a few days earlier from a non-conference tournament in the Maritimes had left a lot to be desired """"I wasn't pretty,"""" Dore said """"This is our fourth game in eight days and travelling back from Halifax, with all of the delays and all of that stuff it was fortunate we were able to get through it with a win But we still can play better than we did tonight"""" Bishop's, inactive for more than a month with the exception of a scrimmage against St Michael's College two days before, came out strong and rolled to a 16-3 lead halfway through the first quarter, but the Stingers found their legs and led 39-36 at halftime The second half was a see-saw affair that saw the teams tied for the last time at 66-66 with 4:12 left to play before Damian Buckley sealed things The Gaiters, who got a team-high 17 points from forward Hermon Tesfaghe-briel, left knowing they deserved a better fate despite being outrebounded 40-31, including 20 on the offensive glass The Stingers, who also got 13 points from James Clark, entertain the McGill Redmen at 4 pm today The Concordia women won for the first time in five games this season as guard Ebony Morris scored eight of her team's 15 points in overtime in a

19951006,modern,rain,"South, the storm has ravaged beaches and coastal highways, and has left more than a million people without power. The heaviest damage from the storm occurred along a stretch of the Florida Panhandle, from Pensacola east to Panama City. Roofs were torn off houses and boats were tossed up on highways where the storm surge - high water driven ashore by strong winds - left roadways buried beneath tonnes of sand. Early estimates put insurance-covered damage alone at $1.8 billion in Florida, and at another $1 billion in Alabama and Georgia. The damage estimates made Hurricane Opal the third most costly storm in terms of insurance losses after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989, insurance officials said. Opal weakened to a tropical depression by late morning, moving north after its Wednesday night landfall, down from peak sustained winds of more than 240 km/h. It headed for the Great Lakes. In Toronto, Environment Canada meteorologist Phil Chadwick said it's shaping up to be a big storm. Some areas along Lake Erie and Lake Ontario could receive up to 70 to 80 millimetres of rain by this morning. Opal was expected to deliver up to 50 millimetres of rain last night and this morning in the Montreal region, with most of the precipitation occurring at around 8 a.m. Environment Canada meteorologists also predicted winds of up to 70 km/h - almost half the speed of minimum hurricane force. """"That's quite a lot of rain within a 12-hour period,"""" said Francois Gagnon of the Environment Canada office in St. Laurent. """"But everything should diminish and return to normal by the afternoon."""" Hurricane Opal is the 15th storm this season to be named; it was downgraded to a tropical storm 10 hours after hitting land. The eye of the storm came ashore at Destin in Okaloosa County, Fla. Hurricane-force winds extended east and west, affecting a stretch of coast from Pensacola to Panama City. Emergency planners in Florida said early warnings and the evacuation of more than 100,000 people on Tuesday and Wednesday from vulnerable coastal areas had kept the death toll low.

20020821,modern,rain,"A14 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 21, 2002 WORLD A flood of tears in Europe WILLIAM J. KOLE Associated Press ROTTENEGG, Austria - This is the summer of Rottenegg's discontent. Tight-lipped and teary-eyed, Henrietta Karl leaned on her shovel and pitchfork yesterday amid the tangle of muddy debris that trashed her home and offered this requiem to Europe's worst flooding in well over a century: """"Now the real work begins: rebuilding a life."""" As the waters ebb, the enormity of the destruction is starting to sink in. Hundreds of thousands of Austrians, Czechs and Germans are struggling to mop up an estimated $31 billion worth of damage and salvage what they can. """"It was very, very bad,"""" said Karl, 62. """"Everything, and I mean everything, was under water. All of my flowers, all of my shrubs - they're gone. I'm lucky I still have a house."""" It's what Ernst Strasser, Austria's interior minister, meant when he told the nation a few days ago: """"The worst hours are behind us, but the most difficult days lie before us."""" Germans know the feeling, as the swollen Elbe River continues to inflict fresh destruction on dozens of towns and villages. In Dresden and other places where waters were receding, residents crept cautiously back to their homes yesterday to examine their sodden belongings and determine which might dry out - and which were ruined for good. Sabine Wilmer's home in Dessau on the rain-engorged Mulde River was spared, but the 38-year-old teacher was blinking back tears after trudging through knee-deep water to the flooded school where her son studies. """"All the things that he loved there are under water,"""" she said. """"Who knows if any of this is insured?"""" Mingled with the despair was relief among some that it could have been much worse. """"I was so lucky,"""" said Nicole Aurich, 25, hauling debris from the basement of her four-storey apartment building near the Elbe, where the water line was still visible about a metre up the outside wall. """"I lost only a backpack, some books and things in the basement - nothing important,"""" she said. Heartbreak also played out across the flood-stricken Czech Republic, especially in Prague, where the worst flooding in 175 years has driven at least 150 families from their homes in the capital. Jitka Zichova, 60, who fled her Prague apartment with just a few clothes after floodwaters reached the second floor, spent yesterday rummaging with long, blue rubber gloves through a large pile of mud-caked trash containing her belongings. """"We lost our wedding pictures,"""" she said, bursting into tears. """"Now we are beggars. I never want to have any possessions again."""" A few houses away - down a foul-smelling street lined with mud-caked mattresses, waterlogged books and ruined electronic equipment - Karel Hajek, 73, stood in front of the home he built 40 years ago. """"I didn't have insurance,"""" he mused sadly. Back in Rottenegg, a sleepy hamlet of fieldstone houses and winding lanes fringed with geraniums about 220 kilometres west of Vienna, villagers pitched in yesterday to help Anna Gattringer gather what's left of her nursery. Twice over the past week, torrential rains pumped a nearby creek into a raging, snaking torrent that tore Christmas trees from the earth as though they were dandelions and peeled the asphalt off the parking lot like it was the skin on an orange. """"It was wild water, and it tore up my business,"""" she said, choking back tears. """"Look at this. I lost millions. I lost everything. You spend 30 years building a business, and overnight, a stream gone crazy sweeps it all away."""" Anton Cech, who runs a nearby stand that sells beer and bratwurst, peeled potatoes while waiting for an insurance agent to assess the damage to his stall. """"Am I afraid it will happen again? You bet I am,"""" he said. """"But it's hard to move. And it's so easy to forget what that little stream can do when it becomes a raging monster."""" It happened before, in 1954, when rain hung like gauzy curtains over Rottenegg for two weeks. The Rodl River - normally a placid trout stream - boiled over the same way it did last week, taking out everything in its path. """"But people are coming to help, even though they have their own problems,"""" Cech said. """"That's how we fight this catastrophe. It is the spirit of our people."""" CMSMLOMM On Gold & Diamond Jewellery 5 Net Interest ALSO We buy gold and diamond jewellery UNIQUE JEWELLERS 1255 Phillips Square, Suite 1111 281-6551 Chinese brace for flooding AUDRA ANG Associated Press BEIJING - Rising floodwaters in central Hunan province menaced embankments that shield more than 10 million people, as China's second largest lake swelled to the verge of overflowing, state media reported yesterday. Hunan has been one of the provinces worst hit by flooding, with 108 people killed this month alone. Across China, this year's floods have reportedly killed close to 1,000 people and caused $3.6 billion in damage. The China Daily newspaper said thousands of residents near Hunan's Dongting Lake were mobilized to bolster flood defenses. Water in the lake had risen to 32 metres by Sunday, 45 centimetres over the flood-warning mark. According to Hunan's water resources department, thousands of residents and workers have been asked to reinforce 1,800 kilometres of embankments and keep a 24-hour watch on dams along the lake and the Yangtze River. The embankments protect more than 10 million people and 1,648,150 acres of farmland. Flooding on the Yangtze and in northeast China in 1998 killed 4,150 people.

19901112,modern,rain,"C rainstorms cause widespread flooding, close roads, rail lines CANADIAN PRESS VANCOUVER More than three days of torrential rain in southwestern British Columbia forced families to evacuate their homes, destroyed buildings and caused millions of dollars in damage to highways and property. The most devastated area was the Fraser Valley east of Vancouver where hundreds of hectares of prime farmland were under water and the Trans-Canada Highway was washed out. Highways Minister Rita Johnston toured the area by helicopter yesterday and said flood victims will receive emergency help. Ministry officials said it will cost millions to repair washed-out roads and bridges. While water levels in the Fraser Valley began to recede last night, a Labrador helicopter from CFB Comox began rescuing about three dozen residents in the Sayward area of northeastern Vancouver Island. The evacuees were taken from their homes along the swollen Salmon River to a recreation centre in Sayward. In Abbotsford, dairy farmhand Dan Gilding, 25, saw a wall of water break over nearby railway tracks Saturday and made a run for it. """"The railway tracks broke and it came over the top like a river,"""" he said. """"Everybody piled into pickups and got out of there."""" More than 300 dairy cattle and 1,000 pigs had to be moved to higher ground along with area residents. Rain remained in the forecast until Thursday but the weather office said it will not be as heavy. That is good news for people who face flooded homes and farms or had to abandon their cars on impassable highways. On top of that, BC Rail couldn't operate to the Interior yesterday because of a washout near Whistler and another south of Lillooet. In some areas, about 200 millimetres of rain fell between Thursday night and yesterday enough to be over the top of an ankle-height rain shoe. The good news was that there were no reports of personal injury due directly to the flooding, although a passenger in a car that missed a curve drowned in a flooded creek. The bad news was that travel was disrupted and property damage may run into the millions. Fields were flooded and buildings damaged, basements swamped and highways blocked by mud and rock and, in some cases, underwater. Solicitor General Russ Fraser and Johnston toured the areas hit hardest by flooding, mainly of the Fraser River, the major waterway in the province. The 1,360-kilometre long river rises near Jasper National Park and winds its way through central British Columbia. Tory MP wants flag-burning declared illegal CANADIAN PRESS OTTAWA A Conservative MP is working to keep the Canadian flag out of harm's way. Under a private member's bill introduced by Bob Hicks, anyone """"who wilfully burns, defaces, defiles, mutilates, tramples upon or otherwise desecrates"""" the Canadian flag would be guilty of a criminal offence. Hicks said he has followed events in the United States, where the flag-burning issue has sparked heated debate between staunch patriots and civil libertarians. The U.S. assistant secretary of state Adolf Berle said, """"Information has just been received from a confidential source to the effect that after the German and Russian invasion and partition of Poland, Hitler and Stalin met secretly in Lvov, Poland, on Oct. 17, 1939,"""" the letter said. The letter, which did not identify Hoover's source, said Stalin had reported to the Soviet politburo on """"his negotiations with Hitler."""" The meeting would have taken place two weeks after Britain and France declared war on Germany.

The major-leaguers wound up the eight-game series with three victories, four defeats and one tie. Finley, of the California Angels, fanned five and walked three in five innings. Johnson, of the Seattle Mariners, struck out four and walked two in finishing. Playing at the Tokyo Dome, which was packed with 56,000 fans, Olson of the Atlanta Braves ripped a home run off rookie Hideo Nomo in the second inning. Ken Griffey Sr. of the Mariners and Kelly Gruber of the Blue Jays smashed RBI doubles in the third to widen the lead to 5-0. Darryl Strawberry said yesterday that he has not fallen off the wagon and that the N.S. ROTHMAN-BEMIAIM Cote St. Luc Have we gone mad? What with all the hunger in the world, and the worry over pollution, acid rain, the ozone layer, the Middle East crisis, destruction of our rain forests, women-bashing and Canadian instability, we should concern ourselves with whether or not cheerleading is sexist (Gazette, Oct. 21)? Have we gone mad? If Janet Ouellette, principal at the Roman Catholic F.S. educated engineer, who was a top official of General Efrain Rios Montt's military regime in 1982, had been placed third by most pre-election public-opinion polls. """"These results are very preliminary,"""" Asturias said. """"But these elections could result in a surprise."""" Carpio, a publishing magnate who had run the best-financed campaign, had been leading by a narrow margin in pre-election polls. Despite its apparent poor showing yesterday, the ruling Christian Democratic Party is the best-organized political group in the country and one of the few capable of providing transportation to take its followers to the polls. The army, which has dominated Guatemala's political life for most of the past three decades, kept a low profile yesterday. BONN, Germany Amid growing controversy and scandal, the former East German Communist Party promised yesterday to give up 80 per cent of its vast holdings, estimated at more than $1 billion. """"The less there is, the less can be manipulated,"""" the party's beleaguered chairman, Gregor Gysi, told a news conference. The move comes just three weeks before the first free all-German elections in nearly 60 years. Polls have suggested that the party still may be able to win the 10 per cent of 12 million votes in eastern Germany that are needed to secure seats in the Bonn parliament. The decision yesterday followed a 16-hour overnight meeting in Berlin, where debate over how much to give away was sometimes interrupted by the sounds of revellers celebrating the first anniversary of the opening of the Berlin Wall. The party assets are to be turned over to a government trust that is overseeing the disposal of state property in what used to be East Germany. But exactly how much the party actually owns is the topic of much debate here. Some estimates put the party's fortune four times higher than its own account. Even after yesterday's move, the party, by its own accounting, is keeping about $300 million of its declared assets of $1.5 billion. Gysi said the $300 million is the minimum the party needs for its political survival. """"We are making a cut that really hurts,"""" Gysi said after the meeting. """"This clean cut will enable us to step into the political future with our heads held high."""" The party emerged last fall from the ruins of the corrupt Communist regime toppled in a bloodless grass-roots revolution. Renaming themselves the Democratic Socialists, the mostly young leaders of the restructured party touted it as the voice of opposition and reform. Critics have demanded the party be stripped of all holdings and be forced to start from scratch. But its """"new and improved"""" image was badly tarnished last month when three key officials admitted they smuggled $71 million out of the country to Moscow to avoid confiscation by Bonn after the two Germanys merged. Gysi denied any involvement in the secret transfer of funds, and he won a vote of confidence from the party when he offered to resign. The party also decided to slash its central staff from 212 to 75 paid members and to give a piece of its prime Berlin real estate to the civil rights groups that spearheaded last fall's revolution. Solar cars prove powerless in the face of Australian rain CANADIAN PRESS KATHERINE, Australia It rained on the world's top solar-powered cars' parade yesterday, the opening of a 3,100-kilometre race from Darwin to Adelaide. Torrential rain and thunderstorms forced many teams to stop and cover their vehicles at various times throughout the day. The race organizer, Hans Tholstrup, said a late start and the storms have ruled out a record time for the five-day race. Early leaders in the 36-car field were U.",
