18800214: OXTAEIO Ta os3cmo, February 13 A collision occurred on the Canada Southern Railway, about a mile and a half west of Tusconburg, at three o'clock this morning, between two freight trains, consisting of about 40 cars each, mostly laden with ZG i-CraJ merchandise, and some with pork, grain, etc. The men jumped for their lives and avoided the impending crash, which was terrific, both engines being raised on their ends, and some cars telescoped and others crushed together in an inextricable mass. Hajkltos, February 13 The man William Salty Hamilton, convicted yesterday of committing a murderous assault on a fellow workman named Geo Buckingham, in Morrison's machine shop, was today sentenced to the Central Prison for 22 months. The prophesied blizzard did not reach here this morning.

18800227: P-P for Chlcoutlmi, has resigned his seat in the Assembly, owing to ill health. A medical man of this city is suffering acutely from the bite of a patient whom he was treating, while laboring under an epileptic fit. A consultation of medical men has been held, and it is not unlikely that the sufferer's finger may have to be amputated. There were 884 patients treated in the Slarite Hospital during the past year, of whom 633 were discharged, 68 died, and 93 remained in the institution; the average death rate was 5.8 percent, which is a result highly in favor of the salubrity and management of the Hospital. The total amount of expenses for salaries, provisions, medicines, etc., for the year was 000. FBOXTOKU-iIO Tokosto, February 29 Property in the neighborhood of Queen's Park has risen in some cases 30 percent since it was decided to erect Parliament buildings there. A feeling is growing that the Government contemplates, at no distant day, removing the asylum and central prison to Mimico, to which the proposed sale of eighty acres of land gives color. Hanlan will shortly appear in talent shows in the Grand Opera House, when the gymnasts give their exhibition. The demand is loudly expressed for competitive plans for the new Parliament buildings. Frank Smith appeared before the Public Accounts Committee this morning and made a statement of the goods supplied by him to Hon. John Carling for the Chicora trip. They were ordered by Mr. Carling and paid for by his personal cheque, and owing to that fact, he had declined attending the committee until he had obtained that gentleman's permission to divulge what appeared as a personal account on his books. Mr. Carling was examined and said that the articles used on the Chicora trip were charged to colonization roads, as the trip was in the interest of the opening up of Muskoka. The Echo was the first to leave the harbor. She left today with a load of lumber. Wdrtotg, February 26 At a meeting of the Provision Transportation of the Westbourne & Northwestern Railway today arrangements were made for a complete organization at an early day. It is intended that the mail will move in a westerly direction from Wthnnnui to stock. A telegram has been received from the Minister of Railways approving of the action of the Manitoba Legislature in chartering this Company. Mr. Collingwood Schriber, who comes to take supreme charge of the Government railways here, arrived today. A heavy blizzard occurred again today. It will probably cause a suspension of traffic between St. Paul, Minn., and Manitoba. A strike which began on Monday last on contract 15 of the Canada Pacific Railway still continues. The first of four locomotives for the Government arrived here yesterday. Madame Cauchon held her second reception today; there were numerous presentations. 

18800312: Mr. A H 'J, for the Ottawa agent of the Quebec & Ontario Railway, in acknowledgment of his efficiency and also the courtesy shown while conducting the emigrant names to Manitoba. It is reported that a terrible blizzard prevailed in northern Minnesota today and it is estimated that soon a blockade will be re-established worse than ever. Manitoba has taken a vital hit this situation. The train with stock belonging to the recently arrived immigrant, which is still detained between Crookston and the boundary, is likely to have a hard time getting through.

18800416: H. Gould, from Stratford, and who was in the cars, was killed, and his nephew slightly injured; one stallion, valued at $1,000, was lost. Mr. Gould's body was taken to Sauk Centre, to be returned to Toronto; his nephew and two of his children will be well cared for by the railway authorities until his relatives are heard from. The deceased had taken up 1,000 acres of land at High Bluff, Manitoba. A family named Forest, from Renfrew, Ont., last autumn, residing with Redden A. Dickson, formerly of Fakenham, pending the erection of their own house near Nelsonville, Manitoba, slept downstairs, and the owners upstairs, where 150 bushels of wheat were stored. On the night of the 6th of April, the beams gave way, precipitating the grain and Mr. Dickson above down on those below. Mr. Dickson awoke instantly, and with considerable presence of mind, struck a light and set to work to rescue those buried in the wheat. He succeeded in getting the head of the husband and one child above the grain, but ere reaching the wife and one little girl, death from suffocation had ended their sufferings. The melancholy accident has cast a gloom in the Mountain Country, where the survivors live; sincere sympathy is felt for the afflicted husband, who lives in a precarious condition, the results of partial suffocation. Wursiptu, April 14 A terrible snowstorm and blizzard occurred today. A large quantity of snow fell. The first day of the 25-hour walking match is over; there are 5 entries, whites and Indians. The score for the 2 hours was: Hornsby, 100 miles; McKeown, 86; Scarlette, 90; Indian Jack, 98; Boucher, 90. Mr. John Campbell, Mayor of London, has invested in property here with a view to establishing a branch of his carriage factory in Winnipeg. There was a warm discussion last night at the meeting of the city council on the bridge question, over a letter received from the Department of Railroads and Canals. It was finally resolved that the mayor should telegraph an acknowledgment of the letter and at the same time state that under present circumstances the terms and conditions of the order-in-council could not be complied with unless the Government were prepared to give assistance to the extent, at least, of $2,500.

18801016: MOSQUITOES We have mosquitoes here, and some of them grow like everything in Manitoba, to a good large size, but mosquitoes with us are not the scourge as represented by our New York Herald correspondent. All the Western States have mosquitoes in abundance, and in passing through to Manitoba I have noticed that nearly all farmhouses along the route have mosquito netting on the windows. Very few of our farmers have mosquito netting on their windows; still, I do not deny that we have mosquitoes, but I have yet to hear of their being a plague. In 1858 I traveled on the prairie from St. Paul to Fort Garry (now Winnipeg). The mosquitoes in Minnesota and Dakota were so numerous and so frightfully hungry that they actually killed the animals, and I am prepared to prove that along the road or trail through Minnesota or Dakota there were dead horses and oxen lying on the prairie every few miles, killed or choked by mosquitoes. When we arrived at Fort Garry, there was not a mosquito to be seen. I have been in the Northwest for 13 years and am still alive. Manitoba mosquitoes do not kill. I will now drop mosquitoes and proceed to STORMS, or blizzards, as our disappointed friend describes them. In my experience, we have generally one, perhaps two, good blizzards during the winter season; but we have been very fortunate in having lost but few settlers by them. Sometimes it happens that an unfortunate, overcome by whiskey, perishes in the storm, but I do not remember any cases in Manitoba to equal the experience of settlers in Minnesota. One winter, there were hundreds of people who perished in a storm which raged over that state. In some cases, men and women were lost while passing from one house to the other, and there is hardly a winter that we do not hear through the newspapers of heart-rending accounts of people lost in the winter storms of Minnesota and Dakota. Will our "Disappointed English Farmer" deny this, or has he any proof to give of a like experience in Manitoba and the Northwest? I will next take up the question of CLIMATE. A "Disappointed English Farmer" writes of seven months winter. Now, I can prove by the written statements of over 200 farmers in Manitoba which I have with me, that ploughing commences early in April, harvest in August, root crops pulled in September and October, and that winter commences in the latter part of November, which gives us say five months of winter. The general weather in Manitoba is as follows: From 1st April to about 20th May, dry, cool, and pleasant; from 20th May to the beginning of July is our wet season (a fact which farmers interested in growing crops will rejoice to hear); the latter part of July, August, September, and October are, as a rule, warm, dry, and pleasant. Of course, there are occasional thunderstorms, and it sometimes (although very seldom) happens that there is an exception to the general rule, as it is in all countries. As, for instance, this year we have had a wet fall, but I have not known such a case for several years, and I am happy to state that the greater portion of our crops were harvested before the rainy weather fairly set in. We always experience cool nights no matter how warm the day may be. In winter, the weather is cold but dry, and on this account, its severity is not felt so much as if the air was damp, as it is often with you in Quebec. During my long residence in that country, I have never worn woollens, and have yet to experience a tinge of rheumatism. I do not deny our cold climate, but I contend that it is more healthy and not harder to bear by the human body than the winters of our more southern neighbors. When our "Disappointed English Farmer" writes that the snow in Manitoba lies six, ten, fifteen, and twenty feet on the ground, he lies. It seldom is more than so many inches on the prairie, except in cases where it drifts into the hollow of a coulee. In the woods, it will accumulate to three or four feet. Our New York Herald correspondent, however, forgets to say that last year the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway, which runs mostly over a prairie country through Minnesota and Dakota, was blockaded a large portion of the winter by snow, and trains stopped for days on the road. I do not say this to the detriment of the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway.

18801116: UNITED STATES Shooting affray St. Louis, Mo., November 15 James F. Flanagan, saloon-keeper, at midnight last night shot two brothers, James H. and Daniel McLaughlin. The two last named, who did not bear very good reputations, entered Flanagan's saloon with a party of friends, had some beer, and the party started toward the door. Then Flanagan called them back. He claims that James H. McLaughlin turned round with a knife in his hand, and he, fearing for his life, pulled a revolver and fired. The ball entered McLaughlin's left breast, killing him almost instantly. Daniel McLaughlin turned around to assist his brother and was shot in the back near the spine. He died this morning. The sister of the dead men arrived from Canada today and was horrified to learn of the death of both her brothers, her only relatives. Stormy weather in the Western States. Chicago, Ill., November 15, A regular "blizzard" set in this morning, snowing and drifting, but the snow is not heavy enough yet to do much damage. Farmers have suffered greatly by the freezing of potatoes, apples, etc., that were not yet housed for the winter. Grand ship canal project It is given out that the time-honored project of connecting the Great Lakes and Mississippi River, by means of a ship canal, will be renewed in the next Congress. It is estimated that some $15,000,000 will be necessary to complete the plan. Obit New York, November 15 Charles F. Ottignon, a well-known teacher of boxing and professor of gymnastics, died yesterday. He was born at Acton, Mass. The silver dollar Washington, D.C., November 15 Secretary Sherman's hostility to the standard silver dollar is very well known; his forthcoming report will recommend that its coinage be discontinued, or, if the coin...

age is to be continued, that the weight be increased so as to make it equal in value to a gold dollar, and that the amount to be coined monthly be left at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. 

The railroad war Chicago, III November 15. To-day both the Wabash and Alton Railway offices were crowded with people. The Alton rate was: St. Louis $2, Omaha $7, Kansas City $5. There is no change from last week's rates to intermediate points. The Wabash road continued selling St. Louis tickets at $1, Omaha $6, Kansas City $4. To-morrow general managers will meet again, but no one predicts what they will do. 

THE IRISH TROUBLES 

The Government and the Land League Leaders Military occupation of Headport. Deputation to Lord Erne. The Land League prosecutions. London, November 15. The Cabinet will meet again to-morrow, and the Irish question will again come up for discussion. The good sense and wise generalship shown by the leaders of the Land League, in preventing an attack on the force of volunteer Orangemen, who went to the relief of Mr. Boycott, near Lough Mask, have clearly banished every pretense of the necessity of the repeal of the Habeas Corpus Act, and opened the eyes of the public to the fact that the Cabinet not only has to deal with a very knotty question, but to contend against men who are closely united with an immense following, and while they have both the power and the will to do anything to gain their ends, are skillful enough to keep within the limits of the law. 

Lough Mask, November 15. Rumors of a night attack on the camp by 1,200 men are unfounded. The country is patrolled by constabulary for miles around. Dublin, November 15. There was a meeting at Knockanross village yesterday for the purpose of formally "Boycotting" thirteen landlords, land agents, and others in that neighborhood. Five thousand tenant farmers were present. Resolutions were adopted that "We pledge ourselves to 'Boycott' these thirteen men and all who act like them, and will endeavor to follow the example set to Ireland by the brave men of Ballinrobe." 

London, November 19. A reinforcement of one hundred men has been sent to Boycott's house. Preparations are made for military occupation of Headport, four miles further on, in consequence of the threatening aspect of affairs. There was no land meeting at the gates of Boycott's house on Sunday, but a great meeting 14 miles off. At the Knockanross meeting yesterday, James O'Brien, an Irish-American, said if "Boycotting" those men had not the effect of reforming them, the people would resort to stronger measures, and try if leaden pills would suit their digestion. The first duty of every Irishman was to get a rifle, and his second duty was to use it. There were 500,000 stout men in America who would die happy if they could kill the cursed Saxon. 

Dublin, November 15. The Lough Mask tenantry will send a deputation of 50 to Lord Erne at Fermanagh, and offer to pay full rent if Mr. Boycott is removed. 

Dunluce, November 15. The Cork Land League have ordered all farmers to poison the fox covers, thus preventing hunting during the coming season. The Government have filed their bill of particulars for the prosecution of the Land Leaguers.

18810107: NEW YORK LETTER 

The holiday season. A cold dip in Wall Street. The Lehigh companies. 

New York, January 5. The gayest and coldest holiday week experienced in this section of the country for many years has passed away. It will long be remembered for the magnificent sleighing and skating afforded to everybody who had the leisure and the health to enjoy those exhilarating pastimes. The turnout of teams in the parks and on the various avenues of this city has been quite unprecedented, and to the curious onlooker not provided with a team of his own—and there are a few such—the mystery is, where on earth they all came from, and where they will all go to when the inevitable thaw comes? In all parts of the city the equipages seemed to spring from the earth, horses, passengers, bells and all, so suddenly did they pervade the thoroughfares with the first decent snowfall of the winter. 

But no pleasure is without its pains. On the second morning of the blizzard visitation, a staid old businessman of my acquaintance, worth a million or so, jumped out of his cutter at his office near the City Hall, and delightedly said to me that he had driven from 86th street inside of fifteen minutes. "By Jove, sir, perfectly magnificent morning!" The excitement of the ride and the brightness of the day did not permit him to discover till some minutes after he was seated at his desk that both his ears were frozen. But it was, alas, and our friend, notwithstanding his fur overcoat and his million dollars, had to submit to an application of cold snow to the parts. It will be some weeks before the organs will resume their customary genteel appearance.

18811026: TWO AWFULLY UTTER

A Deadwood Man's Interview with a Brooklyn Girl 

"Well," said a Deadwood man who had just been introduced to a Brooklyn girl and who has been asked by her if they had many of those lovely frontiersmen out his way, "Well, ma'am, we have right smart of 'em in our neck of the woods." 

"And do they wear fringed legs and hunt those dear, sweet buffalo?" asked the girl. 

"The stage drivers wear fringe and such, and when a buffalo shines out, someone is pretty apt to hook on." 

"How supreme! And those gorgeous Indians in their picturesque wigwams of wampum, with their blending combinations of war paint, do you often see them?" 

"Oh, once in a while we get a hack at a buck, but mostly they are on the reservations," replied the Deadwood man, staring. "They do come in occasionally, but we don't track with them." 

"The sweet things! And you have such sunsets out in your mountain fastnesses, and such loves of highwaymen! Do you ever see those delightful highwaymen?" 

"Not often, ma'am. They get in the brush, and as for sunsets, we get 'em pretty regular in fair weather." 

"Isn't it just too awfully too!" exclaimed the girl, clasping her hands and rolling her eyes. 

"Yes, ma'am," stammered the Deadwood man, "sometimes it's pretty dern, too, leastwise it was the day that Cobbler Duffy came into town on the landslide." 

"An avalanche! Do you mean an avalanche? Oh! Can there be anything more crystal clear than an avalanche!" 

"It was pretty, tooty, utter," hazarded the Deadwood man, dropping into his companion's style of expression. "The cobbler had a crystal shaft up the side of the butte, and one day he was tooting around up there, and things slipped out from under him." 

"Oh! how radiant! How iridescent!" 

"Yes, ma'am, and began to radiate towards town at the rate of 1,000 miles and three furlongs a minute. We seen him a-uttering down the side of the mountains, ripping up trees and rocks and tooting along, and his iridescent wife flapped out of her shack and began to raise a row." 

"Poor Lily," moaned the girl; "did she stop the glorious avalanche?" 

"No, ma'am, not quite. Duffy fetched up against his shack all standing and began to howl like a blizzard, because he thought he'd lost his mine. But when they tipped the landslide on one end, there was the mine underneath just as he had left it, so he could work it right under his window. That was pretty considerable too, eh?" and the Deadwood man never winked. 

"How sublime! How crystalline!" 

"But I was going to say we never had a sunset since." 

"So star-like," murmured the girl. 

"Yes, mostly star-like. You see the landslide stands there to this day on end, and they don't dare to turn it over for fear of filling in the town, so don't get any sun after 11 in the morning." 

"A perennial twilight! So fearfully, terribly, awfully utter!" 

"Yes," murmured the Deadwood man, "It's just about as utter as you get 'em." And she sat and gazed upon him, wrapped in admiration, while he fell into a reverie, and wondered at Brooklyn hospitality in not providing "sand-boxes" for strangers. 

On Top of the Finsteraarhorn 

Far away, but with his great bulk clearly defined against the bright sky, was Mont Blanc, with his aiguilles; and to the left, Monte Rosa, the Weisshorn, the splendid Matterhorn, and the long range which ended in distant Italy. Far away on the other side, too, could we see to the Jura and the Black Forest. The view on the south side is like that seen from the Aegischhorn, with the increased power which 4,000 feet of additional elevation gives it; but from there you cannot, as from here, look north. The near prospect, too, looking down, is most grand; the near circle of mountains which stand round the Finsteraarhorn is a most stately one. There is the Jungfrau, no longer able to make the proud boast of "maiden," a distress now sometimes gentle, sometimes coy, and sometimes terribly stern. There is the Eiger, and the treacherous Munch, whose long, seemingly easy slope is one of the more difficult of climbs; and there, too, the wild rocks of the great mountain we hoped soon to climb reared themselves up into the sky—the "gimmest fiend of the Oberland," the peak of terror—the Schreckhorn. 

There was no wind on that most perfect day. At the height of over 14,000 feet, the air was as warm and gentle as it had been at the Aegischhorn, and though it was difficult to find a place free from snow to sit, we stayed an hour and a half on the top, none of us feeling the least cold. While we ate our lunch, Aylmer pointed out the most prominent of the great west of peaks. Part of the time was devoted to breaking off a bit of the great cornice which overhung from the top. Well held by the two men who got secure footing a little below, we hacked and hewed at it with great labor, till at length it suddenly gave way and went down to the depths below. Four thousand feet it went, breaking into pieces as it struck projecting ribs of rock or ice; and as these in their turn started others, there was in the end quite a respectable little avalanche. So steep are the cliffs which fall away from the top of the Finsteraarhorn, that a stone dropped from one hand falls with very little touch of anything but air to that great depth, while a larger one, started by the other, finds its way in enormous bounds onto the Viescher glacier on the southeast side. 

Blackwood's Magazine. There are many fillers in use of porous hard wood. The following is recommended by an authority in such matters: Take boiled oil and cornstarch, and stir into a very thick paste. Add a little Japan and reduce with turpentine. Add no color for light ash; for dark ash and chestnut use a little raw sienna; for walnut, burnt umber and a slight amount of Venetian red; for bag wood, burnt sienna. In no case use more color than is required to overcome the white appearance of the starch, unless you wish to stain the wood. The filler is worked with brush and rags in the usual manner. Let it dry forty-eight hours, or until it is in condition to rub down with No. 0 sandpaper, without much gumming up, and if an extra fine finish is desired, fill again with the same materials, using less oil, but more Japan and turpentine.

18811103: PLANT AND SOIL

Our prairies have the American flora. Beautiful anemones appear in the early spring. These are succeeded by a carpeting of rose-cacti, leguminosae, and composites; the characteristic of the American flora. On this side of Manitoba and in Kcowalin, the flora is much like that of the eastern provinces. Along the slopes of the Rocky Mountains and well north into the Arctic and sub-Arctic, flora are found pushing their way to the south. At many points these children of the...

North Intermingle with the aura of the prairie. To the fact that you are less likely to be troubled with wild beasts there than here, I have seen bears, prairie wolves, foxes, and deer, but the characteristic animal of the Northwest is the buffalo. To the Indian and the half-breed, a buffalo hunt is the great excitement; but with the encroachment of settlement and Winchester repeating rifles, the buffalo is becoming a vanishing element. They are being replaced, however, by Durham and Alderneys, though I have a notion that if these were crossed with buffalo, a fine breed would be the result. The lakes are covered with wild ducks, and almost every hollow abounds with prairie chickens. Both are capital eating, and anyone who has a good dog can get plenty of sport without going very far for it. Let no one fancy, however, that he can combine the farmer and the sportsman any better than here. The climate is much the same as that of the rest of Canada, though the summer is more humid, and the winter less humid. The thermometer falls lower in winter, but on account of the dryness and general stillness of the air, the cold is not felt as much, unless when a blizzard sweeps across the exposed prairie. As we go west, there is an increase in elevation. What we lose in that way is made up by getting farther from the frozen shores of Hudson Bay and nearer to the influences of the soft Pacific winds. Edmonton, which lies 600 miles northwest from Winnipeg, is about 1,000 feet above the sea, and is in 54 north latitude. Winnipeg is at about one-third of the elevation and only 49 north, yet the winter is milder at Edmonton than at Winnipeg. The general description of the soil is that of a peaty or sandy loam, resting on a tenacious cream-colored clay. The loam is rich enough to stand wheat cropping for a generation or two without manure. The clay retains the moisture and supplies it to the roots of grass and grain in the hottest weather. The soil in Manitoba combines the advantages of loamy and calcareous soil for the cultivation of wheat. The wonderful succulence of the grasses makes it one of the best pasture countries in the world. Some of our horses accompanied us over more than a thousand miles.

WHO SHOULD GO TO THE NORTHWEST? The last point on which I touch is the worth of the Northwest. Society has two members, the foot of the tramp and the name of the intelligent; but there only the latter.

1881-11-17: Major Hargrove has gone to forward a visit for Gladstone. They will leave Hawarden immediately for London. Major Hidout, of Kingston College, has commenced an action for libel against the Messrs. Shannon, editors and proprietors of the Kingston News. After the writ was served, he discovered that the author of the libel was one Joseph A. Allen, of Kingston. A motion is now pending at Osgoode Hall to amend the writ by adding Allen as a party defendant to the suit. Two African lions, one leopard, and one wolf for the Toronto Zoo arrived here today. Representatives from all parts of the Dominion were present at a meeting of the Brewers Association here tonight; the following officers were elected: A. O. Hooper, of Montreal, President; J. Latteridge, Hamilton, 1st Vice-President; E. O'Keefe, Toronto, 2nd Vice-President; James Taylor, Secretary-Treasurer. 

The provincial press and public opinion are universal in favor of the transfer of Crown Land to the control of the local Legislature, and also on the question of the disallowance of local railway charters. At an influential meeting of the Board of Trade yesterday afternoon, resolutions were unanimously passed requesting the Federal Government not to disallow the local charter granted to the Southeastern Railway, inasmuch as such a veto would seriously affect the interests of both the city of Winnipeg and the province generally. The Times of last evening says: "We understand that change is about to take place in the local Government. Hon. Mr. Goulet, Minister of Agriculture, retires, and the portfolio is taken by Hon. Mr. Girard, Provincial Secretary." Mr. Prigsley, barrister, of St. John, N.B., has, on behalf of himself and other associates, purchased several thousand acres of land from the Syndicate in Paure's district to locate a New Brunswick colony. The fifth annual meeting of the Provincial Sabbath School Convention opened here today in Knox Church. Rev. Dr. Rice, who has just returned from Ontario, was elected President.

1882-02-04: P, and other prominent men were present. We learn from the Winnipeg Times that the work of track-laying on the Manitoba Southwestern Railway is being pushed forward vigorously, notwithstanding the severity of the weather. Work is now laid to within one mile of the Assiniboine at Headingly. The construction train has been hampered considerably by the recent blizzard weather. The same Times says that work is being pushed rapidly forward on the traffic bridge over the Red River at the foot of Broadway, connecting the city of Winnipeg with St. Boniface. The filling in of the foundation of the center pier with concrete was completed on the 20th ult., and the apparatus removed to the western bank on the following day. It is fully expected that the entire sub-structure will be ready before the breaking up of the ice in the spring. "At the bottom of the whole dispute," says the Journal de la Compagnie Générale Transatlantic, commenting on Mr.

1882-02-07: O. Henderson, G. F. Brophy, J. Ellis, Chas. McKillop, and Chas. Behaney committed suicide this morning by hanging himself by a derrick at the railroad station. He first tried to throw himself before a passing train, but was drawn off. Shortly after, he climbed a derrick near the roundhouse, and putting the chain around his neck, jumped, immediately dislocating it and killing him. The deceased has given evidence during the past few days of insanity, caused, some think, by domestic infelicity. He left his wife three or four years ago and then married again. He has friends in Chicago and was a railway employee. A severe snowstorm has just set in. The weather has been pleasant, but there are indications of a blizzard.

1882-02-22: We were late today in consequence of the heavy snowstorm last night. Toronto, February 21: The snowstorm early this morning did great damage. The wires of the Toronto Telephone Company were blown down from the 10th building. Their losses alone will amount to $1,000. Thorold, Ont., February 21: A storm of rain and sleet set in at midnight last night, covering the ground about three inches thick. Travel was not impeded. Peterborough, Ont., February 21: Snow fell last night and this morning to the depth of four inches. A snowstorm set in at three o'clock this afternoon. Sleighing is good; travel unimpeded. Brampton, Ont., February 21: A wild storm set in last night. The roads in the country are said to never have been worse. Chatham, Ont., February 21: Weather very stormy today. Heavy northwest wind, with snow. Roads muddy and almost impassable. Grimsby, February 21: The most violent storm of the season is now prevailing here. Ottawa, Ont., February 21: The severe northeast blizzard passed over this city today. About a foot of snow has fallen. The drifts are great, the country roads being almost impassable in many places. Polokhkeepsie, February 21: The sleet and rain storm has been succeeded tonight by snow. Telegraph poles between Middleton and Boston Corners are broken down by heavy loads of ice. Chicago, February 21: Snowing since early this morning. At Rock Island, the storm raged so violently last night that part of the great Government Bridge was blown down. At Vandalia, Ill., the river is out of its banks; the bottom lands, comprising an area of four square miles, are inundated. An immense amount of livestock and lumber is swept away. At Carlinville, bridges and houses have been swept away and great damage done to farms. A sleet and wind storm extended all over Iowa, Missouri, western and southern Illinois, southern Indiana, Ohio, and Canada. Telegraph lines are greatly damaged. BY THE WAY: Venner's "coming storm" has come. The case of Dr. Thayer vs. Foley, for alleged abusive language, was dismissed by the Recorder yesterday. Fairbanks & Co. took out an action yesterday for $620 against the Montreal Abattoir Company for alleged debt. There was quite a respectable "blizzard" in the city yesterday, and by night many of the roads were covered with snow to a great depth. There was a meeting of the Provincial Cabinet in the city yesterday, when all the members were present excepting the Hon.

1882-03-08: FROM WINNIPEG AND MANITOBA: A Southwest Train. The blizzard froze to death. Winnipeg, Man., March 7: Dr. McCallum, one of the resident surgeons of the Montreal General Hospital, has been appointed chief surgeon of the General Hospital here. Track is reported laid for 35 miles now on the Manitoba & Southwestern Railway. Surveys of the road are to be pushed vigorously so as to submit a plan to the Government for approval of the location. On this being secured, the contract will be let for the construction of 270 miles for the end of the present grading, 60 miles from Winnipeg to Souris coal fields. The blizzard of Saturday night left disaster in its train. At Meadowlea, some 110 miles west of Winnipeg, a house belonging to John Taylor was burned down, and his wife and three daughters frozen to death. The body of one daughter has not yet been found. Their hands and feet were frozen badly. Miss Reid, from the city on a visit to Taylor's, kept close to the fire during the night and in the morning went to a vacant house close by, where she was found, and is now in good hands. Her fingers and toes are slightly frozen. The neighbors are out searching for the missing girl, and the whole neighborhood is heart-stricken. Dr. Polford has gone to attend Miss Reid and Mr. Taylor. 

NEW LICENSES FOR CHARITABLE: For Ontario, March 7: In the House of Assembly, Mr. Harberie moved a resolution asking for a return of all correspondence between the local Government and the Dominion Government since July, 1877, with relation to the question of riparian proprietors in this province in the enjoyment of inland fisheries, and touching the granting of licenses. The mover held that the Dominion Government leased the fisheries in direct violation of the judgment of the courts. The motion was carried. 

ONTARIO: Roberts'ville Accident. Kingston, March 7: Fuller particulars from Roberts'ville show that Mr. Steers, who was killed yesterday, was a foreman at the Roberts'ville iron mine. Some ice had remained on a ledge of rock overhanging where the miners were at work, and Mr. Steers, fearing that some of his men might be hurt, was engaged with two or three others in propping it with beams when suddenly a portion of it, weighing about 200 pounds, came down with terrific force and struck Mr. Steers a terrible blow on the head. His skull was smashed in, and he died almost immediately. Midnight Despatches.

1882-03-30: C. Copeland, formerly of Giordan's paper mill, Mernton, is one of the principal movers in the enterprise. Mr. Halkwell, of Rapid City, agrees to furnish the necessary land and water power. The capital stock of the company is $10,000, half of which amount is subscribed. Immigration to the city is unprecedented, averaging daily at least six hundred persons. The authorities are perplexed as to accommodation and are moving actively. At an informal meeting of the City Council, hurriedly summoned this morning, steps were inaugurated to open churches and halls until transportation west could be effected and the weather moderates. The blockade of trains still continues, and nothing has gone to Brandon since Sunday. No trains on the eastern division. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

For a week two trains got through from Emerson this morning after twelve hours travelling. The regular went south all right this evening, but a blizzard set in shortly after, with a still northwester, and closed the lines again. At a large and influential meeting of Knox Church, held tonight, a unanimous call was extended to Rev. H. Blodgett, of Batavia, an ex-keeper of Sing Sing Prison. He testified to being employed there for four months, and having resigned because he could not stand the evidence of brutality around him. He never saw a man paddled, but three convicts had shown him evidence of its use. The flesh was horrible to look at, so thoroughly had punishment been inflicted. The assistant convict doctor told him head keeper Bow paddled a man three times in one day, stopping each time to take a glass of lemonade and rest himself, and then continuing the work. A prisoner in Blodgett's gang refused to work, and was changed. Four weeks afterwards he saw the man in a dark cell; he did not know him. The man said he had been locked up ever since he was changed, with a few crumbs to eat, and no bedding or anything to cover himself. A terrible odor was emitted from the cell. Blodgett gave the man part of his own rations. He would not be a keeper again for a thousand dollars a month, on account of hearing the moanings and lamentations of the convicts while being paddled.

**Postal Money Order**  
Washington, March 30. The House Committee on Post Offices agreed to report favorably the bill modifying the postal money order system. The only important features not heretofore mentioned are the introduction of a postal note, at a fee of three cents, for sums of $5 and under, payable to bearer at any time within three months from date of issue, after which the amount can only be obtained by forwarding the note to the Treasury through the money order office, paying an additional three cents. It reduces the money order fee on sums of more than $5 and not more than $10 from ten to eight cents.

**Mailing Vessel Privileges**  
Washington, D.C., March 30. The House Committee on Commerce reported the bill giving sailing vessels the same privileges in unloading cargoes as steamships.

**Michigan Ship Canal**  
The Committee on Railways and Canals reported the bill for the construction of a ship canal across Michigan.

**An Excellent Precedent**  
New York, March 30. The Telegram's Washington special says Folger today removed several clerks who have been living extravagantly and forgetting to pay their debts.

**Advance in Highwines**  
Chicago, III., March 30. The Western Export Association has agreed, in view of the rise in grain, to advance the grain markets for April to $1.17.

**Veto on Canadian Cattle**  
Washington, March 30. Williams' bill provides that the importation of meat cattle from Canada be prohibited until discrimination against American meat cattle be removed.

**Wife-Beating Bill**  
Annapolis, Md., March 30. The Governor has signed the bill of King, making wife beating punishable by forty lashes and imprisonment.

**Overdue Steamers**  
New York, March 30. The steamship Titania, which sailed for Newcastle January 24th, and steamship America, which sailed from Hamburg February 1st, are so long overdue that little hope is now entertained for either.

**Assigned**  
San Francisco, Cal., March 30. Mosgrave & Bro., dry goods, assigned, liabilities $100,000.

**Kill or Be Killed**  
Greensburg, Pa., March 30. Recently a sick man in Westmoreland County sent for a Presbyterian minister, but the Mormon prophet came and conveyed the man to a stream and immersed him, notwithstanding his protestations. The man died, and since then there has been a strong and growing feeling against the Mormons. They number 75 and are anti-polygamists. Two missionaries in Fayette County are meeting with remarkable success. The converts are principally farmers of the better class. The new religion is slowly but surely spreading.

**The Union Case**  
New York, March 30. The Washington special says it is learned that Mr. Frelinghuysen has instructed Mr. Lowell to apply to the British Government for the stay of proceedings in Dr. Lomson's case prayed for by New York petitioners.

**A Northwest Blizzard**  
St. Paul, March 30. The recent blizzard along the line of the Winona & St. Peter Railway in Dakota was extremely severe. Many deaths occurred on the bleak prairies, but the facts have been suppressed. The deaths in Redfield and Ordway must have numbered 25 or 30. Lieut. Trom, of Fort Sisseton, and one Howard, going to Watertown, were overcome by cold and both perished. Mrs. Long and son, near Krasenburg, on their way to visit a sick neighbor, died. On Monday twelve land explorers left Aberdeen for Watertown on ponies and have not been heard of since. Two ponies were found wandering about the prairie.

**The Liquor Bill**  
Boston, March 30. The prohibitory liquor bill was defeated in the House today. The vote to pass it to the third reading was a tie and the Speaker declined to vote.

**The Mormon and the Edmund Bill**  
Salt Lake, March 30. It is evident the Mormon leaders fear trouble from Mr. Edmund's bill when it goes into operation. John Taylor, Apostle Joseph Smith, and others have quietly removed their wives to separate houses, thinking thereby to avoid arrest under the clause which makes cohabitation with more than one woman a misdemeanor. It is said no polygamous marriages have been celebrated since the bill passed.

**Patent Infringement Case**  
New York, March 30. Judge Blatchford, in the case of Hoe against Kohler, decides that Kohler's newspaper folding machine infringes Hoe's patent. The suit has been in the courts for several years. The decision renders many newspaper offices that use web newspaper presses with Kohler's folder attached liable to injunction and damages.

**18820509:** K pronounces it a "simple fraud." It is notorious that in many parts of Manitoba and the Northwest cattle and horses can graze all winter through and keep in good condition. The best answer to Y.F.'s strictures on the climate with his exaggerated statements as to the thermometer, and with his "snow blizzards," and "their track of universal death," is the "universal" testimony of the residents of the country, who invariably speak of the climate in the highest terms. Wheat-growing, according to F.

**18820822: THE FORESTRY CONGRESS**  
The first meeting of the Forestry Congress in this city yesterday was an event of no slight importance for Canada, and one which, if we may judge by the interest generally taken in the discussions, will be productive of good results. It sometimes requires not merely counsel, but a certain degree of agitation to convince people that they are running risks, or that they must take measures to protect their own interests. The vast and manifold subject on which the members of the Congress undertook to throw light yesterday is one with which the press, both on this continent and in Europe, has been dealing for years, and which has again and again been earnestly debated in isolated societies. It was, indeed, to the reading of a couple of papers on English timber at the Institution of Surveyors that the Empire to which we belong was indebted for the first real awakening of interest in the condition of its great forest resources at home and abroad. In those papers, reference was made to the report of a commission on the state of the forest areas of France, and it was suggested that a series of similar reports on the forests of other countries in both hemispheres would be of great practical value. A number of questions were accordingly prepared by the Institution above mentioned in conjunction with the office of woods and forests and forwarded by the Colonial Secretary to the various colonies and dependencies of the British Crown. The collection of the replies took considerable time, and their arrangement in a readable form was a work still more tedious. It was not until 1875, therefore, that an analysis of all the returns relating to colonial timber was published. The result of the inquiry was certainly of a nature to surprise, if not alarm, those who had hitherto believed that the supplies were inexhaustible. In some cases, in our own land, in Australia, in the West Indies, and other countries, the destruction had been simply wholesale, and, in hardly any instance (the Province of Quebec, we are glad to say, being one of the exceptions), had any measures been adopted to arrest waste or protect against fire. Since then, a movement has been on foot, of which the Congress now in session is one of the outcomes, for the devising of such plans as may put an end to the old injurious, slipshod system and the ravages which it occasioned or permitted. As we have already said, the subject is one in which the whole community is concerned, but it is well known that what is everyone's business is mostly relegated to no person. It was necessary, if any right steps were to be taken, not only that the authorities should move in the matter (and our own Provincial authorities have shown the desire to do all in their power), but that some of the more prominent men of business interested in the lumber trade should unite with men of science and others of intelligence and public spirit to set an example of practical concern and wise provision to the people at large. Mr. Little, the Vice-President of the Congress, was among the foremost to advocate forest conservation and repair in the Dominion, and to him and other enlightened men who attended the Cincinnati convention, Montreal is indebted for the privilege which it now enjoys of being the seat of the Congress. The list of papers to be read was a formidable one, and to do them full justice would demand a longer time than the Congress had fixed upon for its sessions. Some of them were strictly botanical, such as Dr. Mohr's treatise (as it may be called) on the "Distribution of Hardwood trees in the Gulf Region of the Southern States," a paper of considerable research, but too studied and long for a mixed audience, for the most part in search of practical information. Another paper of the scientific class was that of the Rev. Mr. Fyles, of Cowansville, on "Borers in Forest Trees," in which he gave some valuable information regarding the evil work of the phylloxera on the wild vines of his neighborhood, and in which and the ensuing discussion some interesting comparisons were made as to the proceedings of insects destructive to apple, maple, beech, locust, and other trees in different localities. Mr. Fyles was disposed to think that it was only diseased trees that were attacked, while other gentlemen thought that even the healthiest attracted the little depredators. The specimens and drawings with which the paper was illustrated made it one of unusual interest. The suggestions of Mr. Foy, of Woods Hole, Mass., for the preservation of forests against fires, which will be found in full elsewhere, are well worthy of attention, and the "block system" will, no doubt, form a feature in future experiments in forest reform. Mr. Thompson, of Preston Lake, Dakota, will read a paper today on "Shelter-beds," which, it was suggested in advance yesterday, would form admirably effective means of defense against the cutting northwestern blizzards. Mr. Hicks' paper on the "Commercial Value of Pruning" was as practical in the reading as in the title, which suggests the preventable loss in the production of depreciating knots, caused by its neglect.

**18821017: MONTREAL, TUESDAY, OCT. 17**  
A LIBEL ON THE NORTHWEST  
About as cool a piece of misrepresentation as we have met with in a long time is contained in the following extract from "The Settler's Guide to the American Northwest," issued in the interest of the Northern Pacific Railway Company: "The width of country in which the winter climate maintains is limited. Up in Manitoba, in the Canadian Dominion, is a wholly different condition. The excellent line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as projected, was changed for the worse to the south, in the vain hope to get away from frosts in July and August. The climate of Manitoba consists of seven months of Arctic winter and five months of cold weather. And Manitoba is a country of spring floods which drown out all the farms in all the valleys. Her principal river has the peculiarity of running from the south in the United States straight north. The mouth of the Red River is frozen solid when the head and middle of the stream are broken up and running swiftly under the southern spring warmth. The ice dams at and around Winnipeg create a vast obstruction like a mountain barrier. The water sets back and covers all the surrounding country, drowning stock, floating away dwellings, buildings, and fences, and driving the farmers off to the tops of hills to save their lives. So is with Canada's rivers which flow from the west eastward, tributaries to this Red River. They all rise in the Rocky Mountains. The temperature of the foothills of this range being warmer than the open plains of water-soaked Manitoba, all those streams in spring commence running ice at the head before they open at the mouth. The consequence is floods which annually desolate Manitoba and keep the people who have been coaxed into it anxious, poor, and sick. 'Tis a pity that Canada is so cold and so subject to be annually drowned out; for it has a belt of...

Wheat land extending to the Rocky Mountains as rich as any land south of the International boundary line. Ten years ago such a description of the Canadian Northwest might have met with credence; today it excites only smiles of derision on this continent. Yet, receiving wide circulation in Europe, a libel of this character is apt to deter emigration to the Dominion. The wonder is that a corporation like the Northern Pacific Railway Company should lend its sanction to the publication of these atrocious falsehoods respecting the climate of the Canadian Northwest, especially as the country traversed by the American road is in such close proximity to that so unstintingly condemned. The writer of the pamphlet has not, however, performed his task very cleverly. He has gone so far in his detractions that a European emigrant contemplating settlement in the Northwest of Canada or the United States will be disposed to extend his inquiries beyond the information contained in so manifestly partisan a work. For that purpose, he may take up a newspaper of August 3rd, 1882, and discover a telegram from Winnipeg, whose climate, it is said, consists of "seven months of Arctic winter and five months of cold weather," to the effect that "the heat has been intense here during the past two days." The thermometer registered 101° in the shade at noon today. And learning that 104° in the shade is regarded in the country traversed by the Northern Pacific Railway as "cold weather," he will ask himself whether the climate of Dakota, Montana, and Idaho does not approach that of the region to which we are told writers of such pamphlets, as that from which we quote, are consigned, and whether he had not better postpone the possibility of an acquaintance with so uncomfortable an atmosphere until a later stage of his existence. Startled by the dangers of a place in which "the water sets back and covers all the surrounding country, drowning stock, floating away dwellings, buildings, and fences, and driving the farmers off to the tops of hills to save their lives," he may take up a textbook of the geography of the country and learn that about Winnipeg, or for that matter throughout the greater portion of the Canadian Northwest, there are no hilltops to which the farmer could flee to escape such a flood as is here pictured. But if he is a diligent seeker after the truth, he will turn to the record of the climatic character of the American Northwest, and taking up a newspaper of April 8th, 1881, he will read the following dispatch from Yankton, Dakota: "The ice gorge here broke last night. Two hundred buildings had been partially submerged and much damage was done. A steamer was carried away with the gorge for a mile and stranded on the railway track (the Northern Pacific). Two hundred persons here were rescued from the submerged farming districts. The fuel supply has been reduced to a minimum. Many kinds of provisions are running short. The freight swept away thousands of cords of wood." His interest being thus excited and his curiosity whetted, he will endeavor to learn further particulars of a country in which such disasters arise, and continuing his researches to the newspaper files of April 14th, he will find the following graphic description of the condition in Dakota in the spring of 1881: "The Missouri is gradually subsiding. Ice is piled to a height of ten to thirty feet along the bank and on the bars and at the bottoms. Yankton is filling with refugees from the lowlands. Help is needed, as the resources of the citizens are not adequate. Thousands of people are homeless, all they possessed having been swept away. Nearly all the stock on the lowlands, consisting of hundreds of thousands of head, has been drowned. Farmhouses are submerged or floating about in the water. At Green Island of twenty houses, but one remains, and the ice is from ten to twenty feet deep. The bottom from here to Sioux City, sixty miles in length and from five to twenty miles in width, is still under water. Yankton parties are still out in yawls bringing in the people. The city is almost destitute of provisions. Winter still holds on, increasing the suffering of the homeless families. Yankton can furnish shelter for about one thousand, and is making great efforts to supply clothing, fuel, and provisions from a limited store. As soon as the gorge breaks, boats can be sent below for supplies. All railways north and west are snowed in. Eight steamers are lying high up on the ice and far inland. Losses to property in general are very great. The season of floods has only begun. The entire Missouri slope is buried in snow." This will probably satisfy the ordinary intending emigrant that the region traversed by the Northern Pacific Railway is not the Eden which the Company in its latest pamphlet paints it. It will convince him that the statements relative to the climatic character of the Canadian Northwest are not to be accepted as accurate without further inquiry into their foundation, and that extended and impartial inquiry will convey the intelligence that the Canadian Northwest enjoys a climate as healthy as any in the world, that its soil produces the finest wheat crops on this continent, that its plains are free from blizzards and cyclones, that cattle graze on the open plains all the year round without shelter, and that floods are unknown except at long intervals in a small tract of country on the line of the Red River. And as for the Northern Pacific Railway Company, it will come to discover when the intending emigrant ascertains these facts that "honesty is the best policy" even in the preparation of a land guidebook.

EGYPT AND PERU

Egyptologists have been felicitating themselves on the preservation from injury of the Boulak Museum during the recent disturbances in the land of the Pharaohs, and it should certainly be a matter for rejoicing to all students of ancient history that such a noble collection of the vestiges of ancient Egyptian civilization has escaped destruction by barbarous hands. We have not heard of any expression of anxiety lest the fate thus deprecated should befall whatever remains of ancient American civilization the labor and care of archaeologists have succeeded in saving from the ravages of time, ignorance, and prejudice in the land of the Incas. It is true that there is some difference between the value of the Peruvian relics and that of those which have been arranged so skillfully in the institution over which M. Maspero presides. In the South American Republic, there is no museum which civilization at large is interested in protecting from damage. There is also some distinction between untaught and grasping Arabs, by whom the most cherished object illustrative of ancient life is valued simply as a medium for exchange, and South Americans, not quite devoid of sentiments of patriotic pride. The risk, therefore, of plunder in Peru may be less than it is in Egypt. Nevertheless, even our own experience affords evidence of the recklessness of an excited populace, however civilized, and of its small regard, in the hour of fanatical fury, for the rarest or costliest memorials of the past. The safety of what is worth preserving in Peru, during the present reign of disorder, can hardly, therefore, be considered quite assured, and that there is much in the country the loss of which would be thought disastrous by students of American antiquity and of comparative ethnology can scarcely be doubted. From some points of view, indeed, such a loss would be even more grievous than that of any old-world monuments. The latter have been so profoundly studied and their significance set forth by so many men of learning that, though there may still be much to do, a good deal has been already done towards the solution of the problems which they suggest. It is otherwise with the relics of American antiquity. It is only in comparatively recent years that they have begun to receive that attention which they merit, and the interesting questions which they call up are by no means settled. If we take the entire range of American antiquities, northern, central, and southern, we shall find it to be a field of vast extent, a great part of which is still but sparely, if at all, occupied. And certainly there is no division of it which can be said to possess greater interest or to offer larger scope for enlightened study than the civilization of the Incas. Their pottery, stoneware, and wood and metalwork of all kinds indicate no contemptible progress in some branches of art. In architecture, they had reached a degree of excellence which in some respects was wonderful. Humboldt could hardly sufficiently admire the great road of the Incas, "that stupendous work by means of which communication was maintained among the provinces of the empire along an extent of upwards of 1,000 geographical miles." At equal distances apart, along its course, were inns, baths, etc., intended for the accommodation, some of the family of the sovereign, others of the traveling public. Some of these were, not very long since, in good preservation. The great philosopher just mentioned says that none of the Roman roads in Italy, France, or Spain appeared to him more imposing than that great highway through the lofty Peruvian uplands. No less surprising were their aqueducts which the Spanish conquerors ruthlessly and stupidly destroyed. Though they had not learned the use of the arch, the Peruvians ingeniously contrived to bridge the torrents which intersected their roads. Their temples and houses were also constructed with an eye to beauty as well as to utility. In their religion and social customs, there was much to provoke comparison with those of nations in the old world, and some have even found a resemblance between them and the Egyptians. It is evident, therefore, that Peru, as well as Egypt, has some claims on the sympathy of the learned. It would not only be a loss to the civilized world but a disgrace to all Americans if the precious relics of its past were allowed to be destroyed. What may be the extent of its collections we cannot say, but, as already several cabinets of value have been sold out of the country, it may be taken for granted that the successive governments and learned Peruvians have not been so indifferent to their own antiquarian resources as to make no effort at the preservation of illustrative specimens. The subject is one of interest to antiquarians on both continents and, though there may be no ground for fear that the museums of Peru will run any risk in the present unsettled state of the country, it would be more satisfactory if provision were made which would, as far as possible, secure them from angry invaders or rough-handed mobs.

AN UNLUCKY MINISTER

Mr. Crooks is likely to prove the "Jonah" of Ontario, as Sir Richard Cartwright did of the Dominion Liberal Ministry. His conduct in the case of the interdiction of "Marmion" has aroused a strong feeling of indignation against the Government in the Province, and to the blunder of ignorance, or stupidity, or fear of which he was then guilty, is added a deliberate act of mean treachery that strengthens the evidence of prostitution of power to personal aggrandizement accumulated against the Mowat Administration. The case in point arose out of the appointment of a solicitor to the University of Toronto, and the statement of the facts we take from an Independent Liberal journal, the Telegram. By provincial statute, the management of the finances of the University is vested in the Government. This management the Government some time since delegated to the Finance Committee of the University, the committee, however, though composed of members of the Senate, being answerable for its acts to the Government alone. About the commencement of the past summer, this committee recommended Mr. Crooks to appoint Mr. W. Macdonald its solicitor, a somewhat different position, it will be seen, from solicitor to the University, which is entirely in the gift of the Senate. Mr. Crooks accepted the committee's recommendation, and in a letter to Mr. Macdonald informed him that he was to consider himself the locum tenens until he should permanently appoint him. More distinct pledge could not have been desired. Accordingly, Mr. Macdonald entered into his new duties, took an additional partner into his firm, and made business arrangements of a permanent character, of all of which Mr. Crooks was fully cognizant. Imagine, then, Mr. Macdonald's surprise at being informed about a month ago by a letter from the Minister of Education that Mr. 

18830105: Between the second week in April and the second week in September is the season for crossing. This year Canada is very prosperous, the Finance Minister having a surplus of $7,000,000. Winnipeg, the capital of the Northwest, has 30,000 inhabitants. When Sir Garnet Wolseley occupied it in 1870, there were but 270. Land could then be bought for $1, but now is $3,000 per acre. Wages are good all around, especially for females. The prairie lands have ample room for many thousands, and farming is of the simplest kind. Each farmer ought to have supplies for his family for eighteen months, since it takes that time between turning up the virgin soil and selling the first full crops, yielding on an average of 28 bushels of 66 lbs per acre. It requires $80 to $200 to begin a 160-acre farm. I found most farmers making progress. Good government and free grants were 160 miles west of Winnipeg. The Canadian Pacific Railway, the Hudson's Bay Company, and the Duke of Manchester's Association are selling prairie lands at 10s 4d per acre, higher near villages. The heat was 95° on August 4, and 140° in the sun; 68° summer. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

average The dry cold, without wind, for about 15 days yearly is 30 below zero, with 18 below zero as a winter average. Notwithstanding the great differences, the inhabitants are healthy, sturdy, and energetic. Read "A Year in Manitoba," (Is Chambers, 47 Paternoster Row, EC). The drawbacks—mosquitoes, occasional blizzards of rain or snow, etc.—are no doubt great, and require a stout heart to combat; yet the advantages and hopes of success are much in excess of these obstacles. I particularly enquired at what price good Manitoba wheat could be put on the Liverpool market. Owing to the new railways and route via Prince Arthur's Landing and Lake Superior, it will cost 33s per quarter; in the Old Country, 42s hardly pays. In Ontario, they are largely rearing cattle, sending them over here dead or alive. There are excellent farms selling cheap. Apply, Hon.

18830119: P., is a bright and shining light in the Reform ranks, in which his ability to shift his opinions from year to year in pursuance of the winding courses of his leader has given him an excellent position. Mr. Charlton is a Yankee, whose natural sympathies are with the United States, and who, in obedience to the promptings of those sympathies, would apparently delight in a disruption of the provinces forming the Confederation. That at least is the inference to be drawn from his language at the recent Reform convention, when he described the French-Canadian race as "the hereditary enemies of Ontario," and as "the sworn and mortal foes of Ontario." A year or two ago this same gentleman, having occasion to refer to some French-Canadian, politely described them as "lick-spittles." It is only in the Liberal party that a man of this character would be tolerated, and perhaps, after all, he only speaks in plain language the sentiments of his leaders. The London Money Market Review has been doing its utmost to deter English investors from placing their money in the Canadian Northwest, and in pursuit of this object has opened its columns to all who desire to traduce the land. One of the most wicked of these slanderers has been a Mr. Kennett Ffarrington Bellairs, whose history is thus recounted by the Winnipeg Times: Mr. Bellairs was some time ago one of the leading men in the English colony which settled in Martin County, Southern Minnesota. While there, he wrote letters to the St. Paul Pioneer Press and other newspapers denouncing his native land, which he described as a nation of paupers. He represented himself as a member of the London Stock Exchange. Of course, Mr. Bellairs and the colony came to grief, and "K. I. T.," as he was called by his profane Yankee neighbors, returned to London and the curbstone, breathing vengeance against the American Northwest. He has now turned his attention to the Canadian Northwest. But, as a matter of fact, Mr. Bellairs was never in the Canadian Northwest in his life; and his description of blizzards, of the settlers being compelled to burn hay in ovens, and so forth, is wholly based on his experience in Martin County. Unfortunately, the misrepresentations of an adventurer of this character are too often accepted as gospel by the English public.

18830120: J., January 19. Two girls of the Salvation Army instituted $10,000 damages against the Rev. Charles Pelletreau, Rector of the Episcopal Church. Pelletreau last Sunday severely criticized the tactics of the Army. Lawlessness in the South. Shreveport, January 19. In a desperate encounter between desperadoes and a sheriff's posse in Sabine Pass last night, John Morgan, leader of the desperadoes, and John Furlow of the sheriff's posse, were killed. The Hawaiian treaty. Washington, January 19. The National Board of Trade today passed a resolution favoring the abrogation of the Hawaiian Treaty. The ice harvest strike. Kokomo, January 19. The strike among the icemen on the Hudson has ended; in most cases, the proprietors acceded to the demands of the laborers. A row about Mrs. Landry. St. Louis, January 19. Since Mrs. Langtry and Fred Gebhardt came here, the papers have published many articles about them. On Wednesday, the Globe-Democrat contained a more than usually annoying article. On Wednesday evening, meeting Major Cunningham, reporter for that paper, in the hotel, Gebhardt charged him with being responsible for all the vileness published regarding himself and Mrs. Langtry. Cunningham declined to accept the responsibility, when Gebhardt insulted Cunningham grossly and challenged him to a fist encounter. Cunningham refused to fight with fists but said he would give Gebhardt a chance to fight with gentlemen's weapons. Cunningham was finally led away by his friends. Yesterday, Cunningham sent the dramatic critic of the paper to Gebhardt with a challenge, which was delivered in the presence of Mrs. Langtry. The latter was very much agitated and entreated Gebhardt to ignore the challenge. After a time, Gebhardt consented to do so, and admitted that he had, perhaps, spoken hastily. Cunningham considers Gebhardt's concession insufficient and says he will post him as a coward unless ample apology is made. Friends of both parties are seeking to effect a reconciliation. Another account says the trouble originated in comments on Mrs. Langtry made by parties in the audience and printed in the Globe-Democrat. Heavy Snowfall in the Northwest. St. Paul, January 19. Last night and a portion of today, the hardest snowstorm of the winter has prevailed. Some railroads are blocked, and the trains are snowed in near Morris. Cedar Rapids, Mich., January 19. Trains on the Burlington, Cedar Rapids Northern Railway have been abandoned on account of the snow blockade. The thermometer is 20 below zero. Sioux City, IA, January 19. The blizzard in this section is very severe. All the roads leading here, except the Sioux City and Pacific, are blocked, and not a wheel is turning on the St. Paul. Omaha, Neb., January 19. The storm today was the severest in five winters. The thermometer ranged 21 below. The Reading Salt. Philadelphia, PA, January 19. Alexander McEwen, the English financier, has filed a claim in court for $343,000 against the Reading Railway. He maintains that this amount is due him for originating and carrying out the deferred income bond scheme. Locomotive Explosion. Boston, January 19. The engine of the Providence express on the New York & New England Road exploded at Norfolk tonight. The engineer was badly scalded, the cab was blown to pieces, and the tender damaged. Donation to Harvard. A gift of $250,000 is reported from the citizens of Cambridge to Harvard College for the erection of new dormitories, the rent of which is not to exceed $30 a year. The Tariff Bill. The New York Tribune's Washington dispatch says: Republican representatives strongly favor the dropping of the Tariff Bill, reported by the Ways and Means Committee, should an opportunity offer, and the accepting as a whole of the one prepared by the Tariff Commission. The objections of many representatives to the House bill seem to spring from the despair of ever being able to understand the effects of its provisions. Sports and Pastimes.

18830203: M. Duclos is now out of danger and M. Fallières is recovering. A new planet has been discovered by Rolla, an Austrian astronomer. The Ontario elections will be held on the 27th instant, nomination day being on the 20th. A blizzard is raging in the West, and trains are blockaded on the Union Pacific and branch lines. Workingmen's candidates have been nominated in West Toronto for the coming elections. Heavy gales on the British coast continue. Two wrecks are reported on the Isle of Man, the crews in each case being lost. It is believed the authorities have got a witness who can positively swear to two of the prisoners at Dublin as the men seen driving from the scene of the Phoenix Park murder. The revolution which recently broke out in Ecuador has been almost completely successful, the Government forces having retired to Guayaquil, the last stronghold of the Dictator. Dominion News.

18830206: C., who is now in this city, is greatly interested in the workings of the fire departments of the large cities in the Dominion and the United States. On his way hither, he has stopped at all the cities of importance and investigated the workings of the departments, and will render a report of his observations to the Victoria City Council on his return. At the present time, the Victoria Fire Department is not working satisfactorily, and in view of rapid development in the near future, the question of waterworks is being agitated and will probably be among the improvements in a few years. He will make a thorough inspection of the methods adopted in this city for the suppression of fires, and will then make a trip eastward to Quebec and Montreal for the same purpose. Revenue has confirmed the seizure of a large number of empty petroleum barrels in Kingston and Napanee from which the inspection marks had not been obliterated, in contravention of the law. The barrels will be confiscated. The Minister has also ordered a fine of $1,000 to be imposed in each case where an infraction of the law has been shown. An accident of a rather serious nature occurred this morning at the Canadian Pacific Railway depot. The Aylmer train had just crossed the Chaudière Bridge and was rounding the curve near the depot when a freight train came along, and before anything could be done to avert the disaster, the two trains collided. The engineers and stokers of both locomotives jumped just in time to save their lives and escaped with slight injuries. The concussion created the greatest consternation among the passengers on the Aylmer train and sent them flying in all directions, but they all escaped without serious injury. The locomotive attached to the passenger train is a total wreck; the other is only partially destroyed. The loss will probably reach $15,000. The Typographical Union of this city asked, about a week ago, for an advance of ten percent on their present rate of wages. All the offices except one job office acceded to the request. This morning, however, there was a misunderstanding at the Parliamentary Printing Office, and thirty printers left. A meeting of the Union was held this afternoon, and the difficulties were arranged. The trouble was caused by a question of division of copy among piece and week hands. All the men in the Parliamentary Office have gone to work on week work. Only one office now holds out against the Union. The revenue accrued in 1882, as furnished by the Crown Timber Office at Ottawa, is: Quebec, $457,564.71; Ontario, $270,158.87; Dominion, $114,004.81; total, $841,738.39. On Saturday, Mr. Gisborne, Superintendent of the Signal Telegraph Office, patented his new telegraph wire. He claims that by its use, one thousand words per minute can be transmitted. It will be drawn direct, and he says, will be of greater strength and lighter resistance than any now in use. Mr. MacDonald, Mr. Cape Breton, had an interview with Sir Hector Langevin today with reference to public improvements in his constituency. Dr. Gorrin, Mr., will make some new suggestions during the present session regarding the coast telegraph system, the nature of which he will take an early opportunity of explaining in the House. Dr. Wiggins will issue an almanac in a few days. It will contain the dates of the great storms of 1883. The doctor says there will be a blizzard on Friday next, but it will be nothing to compare with the big blow of the 11th of March. Manning & MacDonald have been notified by the Department that their contract for the Pay Canal improvements is the lowest. They have not yet accepted. Hon. Mr. Harrington, Premier.

**New York, March 2**  
It was amusing to note how the high and dry folks of the old Knickerbocker families, who are such a great ornament to this metropolis, were "consterned" (as the French say) by the marriage of Miss Kernohan to Mr. Tell. Miss Kernohan, who, it appears, is only twenty-five, did not ask her august parents' leave to marry her lover, a mere boy of thirty, and the absurd old gentlemen went and abused the parson who performed the ceremony. Was anything ever more ridiculous? It is a pity if two people whose ages united make 65 years are not old enough to think for themselves and decide what was best for them to do. The "world's" publication, The World, next day had a silly article to the effect that clergymen should not marry people unless satisfied that no impediment exists in the shape of a dissenting parent, and so forth. What bosh! Does The World want French laws here, by which a man under twenty-five dares not marry without the consent of his parents? Or was the writer so "concerned," along with the rest of the fashionables, as to produce an article which sounded very much like as if the author was fuddled when he wrote it? It is worthy of note that the respectable clergyman who married the couple (at a very unfashionable church on the Bowery, by the way) paid no attention whatsoever to the passionate abuse of the old millionaire, but let him pump, pump, till he pumped himself out and away. That is real, practical Christianity for you.

**THE STOCK MARKET AND THE BOMB**  
Though things are undeniably dull in Wall Street, and lots of $30,000 brokers are not making living salaries out of commissions, yet those who can look past a foggy chasm or two see the rosy hue of the coming dawn in the east. The truth question will soon get its quietus, for a time at any rate; the season of blizzards and floods is coming to an end; exports are growing, and indications are that gold will soon be imported. Then prices will begin to rise, and though money may burden, that will not prevent the advance. It always does burden in a boom, as in a buying market people want to borrow money more than when they are selling. There are lots of cheap stocks to be picked up on which large profits will accrue to early purchasers. The Vanderbilt stocks are all low enough for a raise, so is Missouri Pacific, and the Southwesterns, and so is Western Union, which has radically got the telegraph field to itself for years to come. The only trouble which can arise is a railroad war, but there is plenty of business, and railroads don't fight when freights are good, as they are bound to be for months to come. The scarcity of Erie stock excites comment. There are over 800,000 shares yet it is said that a borrowing demand for 30,000 shares could not be filled without difficulty. It is alleged that Mr. Vanderbilt has been picking up lots of Erie, and that next year, when the property is once more controlled by the shareholders, he will be found in possession. By next year three dividends will have been paid on the preferred stock, when under the reorganization agreement the power of the trustees comes to an end. It was one of the pet ideas of old Commodore Vanderbilt to get possession of Erie, but he dropped it like a hot potato when he could get into the concern with Fisk.

**DIRGE DISASTERS**  
The year thus far has been singularly prolific of grotesque and horrible head-lines by sea and land. The slaughter of the 400 passengers on the Cimbria is soon followed by the drowning of seventy miners in a shallow coal mine in Illinois like so many rats. The other day in New York fourteen children were literally crushed to death in a useless panic mainly because their friends and relatives in their anxiety to get their little ones out of a school building presumed to be on fire blocked up fatally the only door of egress. Sunday night at eight o'clock in the village of New Brighton, a woman and her two children perished in the wreckage of a burning house, hardly ten feet above the sidewalk. The firemen did not know that they were in the building till many minutes had elapsed, and it did not seem to occur to the sapient chief to inquire if there were any people in the house. Had he done so, lives would have been saved, as the upstairs was not burned much, and the poor creatures died simply of suffocation.

**18830308: & B Railway Co., Kingston, Ont., March 7**  
The storm today and last night has been very violent. The snow has drifted badly and blocked the railways. No trains today but one on the Hamilton line and no train or mail from Toronto or Hamilton have arrived, but one is expected tonight from Toronto.  
**St. Catharines, March 7**  
A blizzard struck this section last night about 10 o'clock, lasting till tonight at 6 o'clock. The wind blew a gale from the northwest and the thick, fine snow was driven through every crevice and piled up in drifts in favorable places, yards high. Country travel is practically stopped, and railroad traffic is an impossibility. Today no trains, except one due the day before, have arrived here. The Grand Junction morning train put out but three miles east of here became stuck and is there now. It is growing colder now (10 p.m).  
**Toronto, March 7**  
The storm last night was the most severe of the whole winter. Early in the evening the snow began to fall and the wind rose very high from the northwest. All roads and side lines running north and south are completely blockaded. The Midland Railway is blocked from end to end except a few miles at this end. A train left here at midnight for Midland, but at seven o'clock this morning it had only reached Perrytown Station, about eight miles out. Two locomotives were sent to pull it back to Port Hope, and after hard work they reached the train and brought it to this station. Locomotives were then dispatched to clear the track, but by noon had only reached Millbrook, 30 miles north on the main line. Gangs of men are working at all the sections, and it is determined, if the elements will allow, to have communication open tomorrow.  
**Fergus, March 7**  
Trains are all canceled, none having arrived or departed from here during the day, and the only communication we have is by telegraph.  
**St. Johns, Que., March 7**  
A snowstorm set in about 11 yesterday and continued all day and night. The snow being very light, very little delay has been caused to the trains. Very little has fallen today and it is now calm; thermometer 8 above zero. Advices from Eastern Ontario and Upper Ottawa points report a snowfall of from four to eight inches, and cold weather, the roads being much drifted.  
**Newport, March 7**  
A severe storm occurred here yesterday. Wiggins' prediction is creating a good deal of uneasiness, especially among the women and children.  
**The prison labor question**  
**Pittsburgh, March 7**  
The Grand Secretary of the Knights of Labor will shortly issue a circular to the members of the order in New York and Pennsylvania, calling on them to organize in opposition to the convict labor system, and send protests to the legislatures. He says the question will be made a political issue in the next campaign.  
**Albany, N.Y., March 7**  
The Assembly Prisons Commission today heard a long address from John J. Perry, stove manufacturer, in defense of the convict labor system. The Masters, James Connelly, John J. Meddigan, James Lynch and others, representing various trade unions of the State, bitterly denounced the system.  
**Midnight Despatches**  
**PROBABILITIES**  
**Meteorological Office, Toronto, March 8, 1 a.m.**  
The important storm mentioned last night has passed over the Maritime Provinces, and is now apparently situated near Newfoundland. The anti-cyclonic system which lay over the northwest has moved to the Lake region, and comparatively low pressure covers the Northwest Territories and the Gulf of Mexico. The weather has turned decidedly colder in Ontario and Quebec, accompanied during the day by strong winds and gales from the west and north. The gale which prevailed in the Maritime Provinces has subsided, and the weather is now clearing with strong northwest winds.  
**PROBABILITIES**  
**Lakes** - Winds shifting to the southwest and southeast; fair, milder weather.  
**Upper St. Lawrence** - Light to moderate winds; fine weather; rising temperature.  
**Lower St. Lawrence, Quebec and Maritime** - Decreasing northwest to west winds; fine, cold weather.

**FAREWELL TO WIGGINS**  
Apropos Wiggins, lay him low, lay him low,

**A drunken father's crime**  
**Boston, May 7**  
John Callahan, of Winchester, went to Woburn on Saturday and bought a gallon of liquor and then went on a spree. He brought a three-year-old child with him and forced him to drink all he could and then threw the liquor in its face. The child went into convulsions and died this morning at a doubtful age.  
**CIRCLEVILLE, Ohio, May 7**  
It is alleged that John Blizzard (colored), who has just died here, was 125 years old.  
**Smallpox in Virginia**  
**Wheeling, W.Va., May 7**  
A smallpox plague is raging in Mecca County. The disease originated two weeks ago from a tramp who was taken sick and who stopped at the house of a farmer named Blankinship. In a day or two Blankinship was taken sick with an eruptive disease. The doctor called in pronounced the malady chicken-pox. The patient died and the funeral was attended by two hundred people. As a consequence, the disease was distributed throughout the county. The physician was taken ill himself, and, after visiting patients several days, called in a brother physician, who for the first time made known the character of the scourge. The disease spread with alarming rapidity. Up to this time, forty cases have occurred and fifteen deaths. The situation is daily becoming worse. The county has been put under strict quarantine by the State Board of Health.  
**The Indian troubles**  
**Fort Apache, Ariz, May 7**  
Twelve hundred San Carlos Indians have left their agencies and are settling in the mountains around this post, and demand grain for seed. The commander has issued six thousand pounds of corn and has asked the Secretary of the Interior for small seed. He fears there will be difficulty in keeping the Indians quiet. The commander here was ordered at the last moment to return to his post from Crooks' expedition, in order to guard against such emergencies.  
**Railway consolidation**  
**Chicago, Ill., May 7**  
It is stated that an agreement has been consummated between the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, St. Louis & San Francisco, and Atlantic & Pacific Railroads, by which the controlling interest in the St. Louis & San Francisco road is secured to the Atlantic Pacific. This is a practical stoppage of the extension of the St. Louis & San Francisco road and equivalent to merging its franchise in the Atlantic Pacific.  
**Charter forfeited**  
**Harrisburg, May 7**  
The Governor has issued a proclamation declaring forfeited the charters of all corporations which have failed to make a return to the Attorney-General within three years, and have not responded since the issuing of the previous proclamation thirty days ago. Between 650 and 700 charters are declared forfeited. The list is composed largely of defunct concerns.

Mt. Auburn County, Boston, May 7. The Senate has passed a bill for the payment of a dollar-a-ton bounty on beets raised for sugar-making purposes. Railway bill vetoed. Boston, May 7. The Governor sent to the office of the Secretary of State without his signature the bill appropriating $261,000 for double tracking the Hoosac Tunnel line.

18840123: P. Railway open to Lake Superior, and with Port Arthur as the objective point under the low-rate system, we are sure of our emigration fronts, whether they land at Quebec or New York. When I first went over to England, I at once, said Mr. Begg, that unless Canada could bid for emigration to stock, as well as for the St. Lawrence, she would always have great odds against her; and I have never lost sight of this fact. See the large number of powerful steamship lines running to New York from Great Britain and the continent. All these have active agencies everywhere, every one of which was bound under the old order of things to work against Canada. Our own St. Lawrence steamship companies were opposed and hampered by all sides of those agencies. It is important to note that in fighting it, especially as the conditions make Canada at a disadvantage compared to the United States—a situation unequal, with the high rates charged to Canadian emigrants. Under the present order of things, all agencies will see their way to work for Canada. It will be popular, and the St. Lawrence Steamship Lines, having agencies throughout the continent, will participate in the result and will get their full share of the increased traffic. 

On being asked whether the facilities offered via New York would not act against the St. Lawrence ports, Mr. Begg said it would have a contrary effect. In the first place, he said, the representatives of the Canadian lines are about the most active men in the business on the other side. With a united house, that is, all hands working for Canada, consequently bringing increased business, you need not fear but that the Canadian lines will get their fair share of the increase. Instead of having to fight against the antagonism of the New York lines and low rates to points in the United States, they are freed from that antagonism and will benefit accordingly. Then, added Mr. Begg, there is another view: we are not taking emigrants away from the St. Lawrence, but capturing a lot of those going via New York, and, in fact, stimulating extra emigration. 

Then again, the whole success of our manufacturers, tradesmen, mechanics, and farmers depends on a regular influx of population. The whole success of the Dominion depends upon it. Canada cannot afford to shut any avenue for supplying her with emigrants, no matter how they come. What does a rapid peopling of our Northwest mean? It means increased trade for Montreal, Toronto, and other cities; it means increased demand for our manufactures and increased work for our people, and better business for our tradesmen. It means increased trade for our shipping, outward and inwards, increased activity for our seaports. Put the question to our shipowners and see what they will say. Our Canadian steamship owners will tell you that to them the greater the population of Canada, the better will be their prospects now and hereafter. They can well afford to open every avenue for Canadian immigration. 

Being asked what certainty there was of our securing our immigrants passing through New York, even with the low rates, Mr. Begg replied, "Every security." Simply because these rates are only available via Port Arthur as an objective point where the United States have no power to divert the emigrants. When speaking of the difficulties in the way of promoting emigration to Canada, Mr. Begg said they were much more numerous than people imagined. American agents are very active and not slow to take advantage of every weapon they can find. But he said the worst enemies to Canada are Canadians, and the worst difficulties we have to face emanate from Canadian sources. We have to contend against Canadians and others who write or speak against the Northwest simply because they are interested personally or politically in another part of Canada. We find Canadian papers gain some political end by decrying the climate or the resources of the country. There seems to be a morbid desire on the part of some Canadian papers to herald forth in the loudest notes anything disparaging to the country to which they owe allegiance. If a blizzard occurs, it is depicted with great headlines and described with all imaginary horror. When it is 40 below zero, all the world is made acquainted with the fact, but the successive weeks of beautiful weather are unnoticed by them as if they had never been heard of. When an early frost takes place, everybody knows it. Of course, the Canadian public can understand that this is done not from any real intention to injure Canada, but to gain a point against the Government, and if it could be confined to the circle it intended to influence, it would not do much harm. But unfortunately, there is a portion of the British press actuated by motives inimical to Canada and Canadian enterprises, who gladly avail themselves of quoting these disparaging statements and sending them broadcast throughout Great Britain. How can we, agents, resent such statements when we are confronted with the fact that they are the utterances of our own Canadian papers? If these same Canadian papers could understand the damage they are doing to their own patrons, they would perhaps moderate their views, for every blow struck at Canada means a loss, more or less, to every merchant, manufacturer, tradesman, and mechanic in the country. 

"Pretty strong language?" said our representative. "I mean it," said Mr. Begg, "I am a Canadian and speak as a Canadian, and my words in this respect will be borne out by every man working in the interest of Canada abroad. The greatest bugbear flaunted in the faces of Canadian agents is the severity of the climate of Canada, whereas the Canadian climate is one of the healthiest in the world. We are indebted to Mr. Geo.

18840209: NEW BILLS. Mr. Williams introduced a bill to amend the act of incorporation of the Synod of the Diocese of Saskatchewan. Mr. McMaster introduced a bill to incorporate the River St. Clair Tunnel Company; also a bill to consolidate certain railways under the name of the Eastern Railway Company of Canada. Mr. Cameron (Victoria) introduced a bill to amend the act relating to the Manitoba and Northwest Railway Company. Mr. Kilvort introduced a bill respecting the Hamilton and Northwestern Railway Company. Mr. Weisl (Westmoreland) introduced a bill to reduce the capital stock of the Maritime Bank of the Dominion of Canada. Mr. Derglin introduced a bill to amend the charter of the Ontario Pacific Railway Company. Mr. Quinn introduced a bill respecting the Kingston and Pembroke Railway Company. Mr. Rosso introduced a bill to incorporate the Quebec Railway. Mr. Allen introduced a bill to extend the jurisdiction of the maritime court of Buffalo. Mr. Curran introduced a bill to provide for the distribution of assets of insolvent debtors. (A member welcomed him.) 

THE RAILWAY DEBATE. Mr. Lam resumed the debate on the motion of Sir Charles Tupper, "That the house do go into committee of the whole to consider certain proposed resolutions respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway." In his opening remarks, he resumed the history of the enterprise up to the present, dwelling upon its special importance to confederation and the future development of the whole country. He enlarged on the excellence of the alignment and construction thus far and the expedition which the government and company had manifested in their work. He spoke of the immense efforts which the government were making in England and on the continent to direct attention to Canada as a place of settlement, on which account it was only natural to expect that there would be an immense influx of immigrants. He praised the government and the company for what had so far been done in completing the road, opening a highway for settlers on Canadian soil, thus keeping to ourselves the immigrants and trade. They had, on this account, done well in saving six years in the work of completion, more particularly on account of the trade with China and Japan, which would be given and preserved to us. Everyone interested in Canada was bound to rejoice in the rapid completion of the railroad. He thought it a matter of economy to assist the company which had thus ante-dated the contract. Ontario ought not to complain because she would have more speedy relief from the existing monopoly. The company had not only built the road more rapidly but better than their contract stipulated for. The opposition in this house had the effect of depreciating the company's securities and had also injured immigration. They had depreciated the company in a variety of ways and had prevented immigration by preaching about extravagant freight rates, depreciating the Canadian Northwest, and by preaching the beauties of Dakota and the delights of Texas. They said that the railway lands were not of the best, that the road should have gone further north, and in consequence that the lands opened up were inferior. They had declared, in addition, that the acquisition of the Credit Valley and other railways would be an unprofitable investment and had led capitalists to fear that the enterprise would not be a paying one. He ridiculed the construction placed by the leader of the opposition on the interview between Mr. Van Home and a reporter of the Montreal Star, and censured the opposition press for the injury they had done by their sensational reports of blizzards and such like. A number of articles and letters had been written for the sake of being published abroad, whose object was to prevent immigrants coming here. He referred to certain publications in the Globe and advised journalists to take a leaf from the book of the United States and never foul their own nests. Having submitted a number of specimen bricks, he continued that it was certain Parliament would manage its own affairs without calling in the assistance of correspondents in London. The gentlemen to his right were indignant that there should be a monopoly in Manitoba; yet when it was sought to rivet the hand of the Grand Trunk monopoly on Ontario, there was no one to oppose it, nor any sweet singer to compose a ballad. "Ontario! Ontario!" Then there had been, in addition, individual opposition, and more than that, the opposition of nearly all the leading American lines of railroad because they discovered the determination to have a Canadian railway from ocean to ocean. All the opposing influences had been supplemented by the condition of the stock market. At 66, as it was at present, 

18840221: I, yesterday destroyed the post office and custom house, and did other damage to the amount of $250,000. Considerable loss of life and great destruction of property have been caused by a storm which swept over the Southern States on Tuesday night. In the Imperial House of Commons last evening, Mr. O'Connor Power made a violent attack on the Parnell party and their course in relation to Irish affairs. A blizzard has been raging for two days in Dakota, and several lives are thought to have been lost, three or four stages not having been heard of after hunting on their trips. 

TERRIBLE BLIZZARD IN DAKOTA. Fatal colliery explosion. Connellyville, Pa., February 20. An explosion in West Lehigh shaft, near here, today, resulted in a terrible loss of life. Seventy-five men were at work in the mine and out of that number, twenty-nine are known to have been killed. Twelve more were rescued but so injured that they will die. The mine was worked by means of a shaft which reaches the mine a distance of four hundred feet from the surface. This morning, a part of the force that worked all night left the mine and seventy others took their places. Soon after, an explosion occurred 800 feet from the bottom shaft and 1,200 feet from the surface. The report was heard outside for a long distance and caused such a jar that a derrick 100 feet high was knocked off. Dick Halsey alone escaped. He wound his clothes tightly around his face and mouth to keep the foul air from choking him and reached the open air. His escape seemed marvellous. Two hours elapsed before anyone dared face the after-damp to search within the mine. Halsey says the men acted like mice in a burning stable, and were bewildered, and, not knowing which way to go, refused to go in any direction. 

Pennsylvania coal mines. WILKES-BARRE, Pa., February 20. The annual report of the operations of the middle district coal field for 1893 shows the total amount of coal mined to have been 705,000 tons, the number of persons employed 1,7000. Six hundred thousand more tons were mined and three thousand more persons employed than last year.

Out of four stages due here yesterday, none have been heard from. It is believed the drivers and passengers have perished in the blizzard. The Ellendale coach was found halfway between Lamoure and Yankton, turned bottom side up, and the driver was found in a house two miles distant, badly frozen. He had no passengers.

1884-02-25: THE LAND REGULATIONS. I asked: "Well, what is the matter?" "Oh, it is the land regulations." "Well, what do you object to in them?" "Oh," they say, "it is the land regulations." Now, as to the land regulations, their advantages were explained so fairly and so fully the other night by the hon. member for Lisgar that it is unnecessary for me to make any long reference to them. But I feel that our land regulations are so liberal, so generous, and so inviting, compared with those prevailing in Dakota, that I cannot refrain from mentioning a few of their features. Hon. gentlemen know that one of the first things that meets a Canadian or any other man who goes to settle in Dakota or Minnesota is the oath of allegiance, especially against Great Britain. (Hear, hear.) Do we impose any such conditions upon anyone who goes to our Northwest? We say: No; you give us your citizenship for three years, and we will give you the land; the American term of residence is five years. They enact continuous residence, with us only six months in each year of the three is required. And with reference to pre-emptions, no settler in Dakota can get a pre-emption until he gets a certificate of his homestead. The result is that he is often obliged to locate his pre-emption 30 or 40 miles away from his homestead. (Cheers.) In our Northwest, the moment a man makes his homestead entry, he can make his pre-emption entry, and he gets the two side by side; and he receives all the advantages that can accrue to him from his entering for that pre-emption by the fact of his occupation of his homestead. It is just as sure to him as his homestead, provided he fulfills the necessary requirements of his homestead. So that there is no comparison between Dakota and our Northwest in that respect. And yet hon. gentlemen get up in this House and state that one of the causes of the exodus, which I could not discover, is the inferiority of our land regulations to those of the United States. 

Now, WITH REGARD TO THE EMIGRANTS, I found a great number of men in Manitoba from Dakota, from Minnesota, and especially from Montana. I met one very intelligent man at Medicine Hat who had been a mixed grazer and farmer in Montana, and he said to me, "As compared with Montana, this is God's country." (Cheers.) That was his expression. Now, I have heard it said that there are large settlements of Canadians in the United States, and hon. gentlemen opposite attribute those settlements to the difference in the land laws of the two countries; I say that is absurd and unfair. I know that there are large settlements of Canadians in the western states, whole districts for miles around; I am speaking more particularly of Michigan and Illinois, in which there are large numbers of people from my own neighborhood. Men whom I have lived with for fifteen years have gone out there. And why did they go? For this simple reason: they were led away by the profuse and attractive advertising not only of the American government, but principally of American railways that had lands for sale. I remember twenty years ago seeing something that I thought should not be tolerated by the Canadian people: the immense placards which were hung up at every prominent point in the country. I remember seeing in the Union station at Toronto, and also at Montreal, immense glass cases, about six feet long, containing specimens of all sorts of grain from Illinois, Minnesota, and other western states. I remember one in particular. In front, there was a prairie scene, with long waving grass, and on one side, a herd of buffalo; immediately in the rear were a number of engineers with their instruments set up, and behind them were men laying a railway track; behind that again were three or four ploughs, a reaping machine, a threshing machine, and other instruments at work, and behind that again were a lot of carts hauling wheat to the railway. Now, what immigrant could resist an advertisement like that? (Hear, hear.) Why, it was a whole lecture in itself. We had no prairie lands to offer at that time, and any young man, or old man either, who was intelligent and vigorous, and was desirous of making a home for himself and his sons at the least expenditure of labor, was not going into the backwoods of Ontario, where he would have to cut down maple trees, and ash trees, and elm trees, to make place for his home. Here was a country completely devoid of all these obstructions, and it attracted a lot of people; hence the settlement of Canadians in the northwestern states. I know many of these old men are strong in their allegiance to British institutions, but they went there for the sake of pecuniarily benefiting themselves and their families, and they lived and died British subjects. I know some who never went to poll a vote; though their sons voted, they did not. (Hear, hear.) What I want to point out is this: that the young people of today are just as strong in their attachment to Canada as those old men to whom I refer; and when we have a country as extensive and as accessible to offer to these people, we will not have many more of these American settlements, provided the gentlemen opposite do not deter people from going in there by their cries about cold, want of feed, bad water, blizzards, and bad land regulations. (Cheers.) 

As regards the weather, the hon. gentleman says the thermometer went down to 40. I remarked that today in my own verandah at Kumptville, it went down to 35, and the strong wind and the damp atmosphere at the time, I am satisfied, registered more on my feelings and those of any man in the country than 40 of the clear atmosphere of the Northwest. I know the frost may have a deterring effect on those who will not thoroughly understand the conditions and the effect it has on that country in an agricultural sense; but it should be remembered that the cold period in the far Northwest is much shorter than it is either in Manitoba or Ontario. Winter comes on in the extreme Northwest about perhaps the middle of November, and men who have lived there ten years say that during all that time there was no season in which they could not sow their grain on the first of March, and the winter is practically gone on the first of February. As to the effects of frost, naturally, it may be difficult to get through the winter until those people have built for themselves comfortable houses and got cheap fuel. But it has this effect upon the country: that every inch of frost that penetrates into the soil during the winter and thaws out in the spring disintegrates the soil elements of the plants which are growing upon it, and adds to the store value of that country as an agricultural region. We know that as you approach the Mississippi from the north, even as far south as southern Dakota, where the frost does not penetrate in such a great depth, from six to eight years is about as long as the average surface of that country would preserve its maximum virgin production, for the simple reason that the frost does not penetrate any further, and as no sub-soiling has been attempted, the roots of the plants do not penetrate into the soil that has not been loosened by the frost. In the lands in that section, which have for years been under cultivation, the falling off from this cause is not compensated by the increase through new territory; but our Northwest will preserve her maximum production of that cultivation four or five years longer, so that even at a much less rapid pace of settlement than our neighbors, her maximum will be continued for a much longer period. (Cheers.)

There is another feature to which I draw attention. Every hon. gentleman who has paid attention to the zone belts of the earth in which food cereals are produced knows that it is in the north temperate zones that nearly all the grains are grown, and the nearer the northern limit of that belt in which grain is matured perfectly, the better is the quality of the grain. What I illustrate by that is this: that we, having today in that Northwest country, a larger area of land fit for agricultural purposes, when we get a fair proportion under cultivation, will produce a larger quantity continuously of a better quality than the American states can ever hope to do, and I state what I know is a matter of fact when I say that wheat near our own boundary in northern Dakota is more valuable than that grown further south. Why is that? Simply because the grain is of a better quality; it is what is technically called of a flinty character, and, when grown, will produce more flour, and is used to mix with the softer grains grown in the southern wheat belt. (Hear, hear.) In the southern belt, the same wheat cannot be grown more than three years successively because it so softens that the germinating properties are lost and half the seeds will not sprout. A large quantity of our wheat, even as early as three years ago, was sent down to that region for seed wheat, as the hon. member for Marquette well knows. The ultimate result of this will be that when that country is fairly under cultivation, when it has a population of five, six, or eight million, its production will be so great that when exported either by the Hudson's Bay route, by the Canadian Pacific Railway, or Port Arthur, I care not how, and landed on the Liverpool markets, those who schedule the breadstuffs and make up their prices for the season will not only ask how much is the production in England, in Russia, or in India or the United States, but the great question will be what will be the export from Canada? (Cheers.) The production of Canada will regulate the prices of the world. This question has been dealt with so long and so variedly and by so many hon. gentlemen in the House, who have many years ago made their maiden speech, that there is very little left for me to say, and I feel that my remarks will have perhaps less interest than they might have had at an earlier date. (Cries of "go on, go on.") But there is one thing, in speaking of the country west in settlement, which I think is very important, and the reason I mention it is that in reading, as I always do, carefully the reports of the geological surveys, I find no mention is made of it, nor is it mentioned by any surveyor or others who have traveled through the country. I think, therefore, that I am perfectly justified in drawing attention to the fact that in the extreme Northwest fuel will be so cheap that the difficulty mentioned by the member for Marquette with reference to building timber will be easily remedied. Now, I quite disagree with him; I am satisfied I know that THE CHEAPEST BUILDING MATERIAL, of the most durable and beautiful quality that exists on this continent, exists in that Northwest Territory. I referred a few minutes ago to the large deposits of almost pure clay. Those beds are the deposits of the disintegration of the hill rocks, long before the country was settled, anyway (laughter), and the lime which the rocks contained has been carried off while held in solution. The clay, almost pure, is deposited, and I refer especially to the coal regions in immense beds over the coal. The only substance that these clay beds contain, aside from the clay, is a silicate sand which is insoluble in water. What drew my attention to this was that I saw at various places on the river banks, natural brick kilns, burnt and almost ready for the market, of acres and acres in extent. It came in this way: The deposits were made over the coal beds by the action of water. In the course of time, ravines have been formed and cut through the coal beds. Eventually, the grass grew over the ravines, and, by some accidents in prairie fires, the coal caught fire, and continued back for acres under the surface, converting the whole superincumbent mass from 150 to 200 feet. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

---

Feet, into one mass of beautiful brick. Hear, hear! It is the CHARACTER OF THIS BRICK I wish to draw the attention of the house to. It is a brick formed from the clay, entirely devoid of lime, containing a silicate sand. In burning, after mixture, there is no expansion of the particles of lime. The brick is almost perfectly compact. It is a silicate brick. It is a crude glass, impervious to water, and almost indestructible by atmospheric influence. I found blocks in the Saskatchewan and in the Bow River, and north of the Red Deer River, which must have been there, perhaps for a thousand years, where they had fallen, by the action of water and weather, into the water. Taking them up and breaking them with my hatchet, I found they were perfectly dry. Taking up ordinary limestone and smashing it, I could see evidence of the porosity and moisture there, convincing me that that brick was more impervious to water than our blue limestone. I found, where they had drifted down the river for many miles, they were as smooth as any slate I ever saw polished. So much with reference to the building material. There is a scarcity of wood, it is true, and transport will cost something, but in that country you find the clay always overlying the material for converting it into brick; the coal you find it over the whole country; and brick may be made into any form: pillars, corners, mouldings into any shape possible for the construction of beautiful edifices, which in the kiln convert into this indestructible brick. There is a notable feature that, when burnt, they may be polished, because they are so compact, and I saw thousands of evidences of their capability of being polished from the action of the water. That is not all, but these clay beds vary from 25 to 50 feet, which were deposited at several spaces of time, and of different colors, the color having been given, no doubt, by the character of the vegetable at the time the deposit was made, and the color fixed by the silicic acid in this sand, which, I think the hon. the minister of finance, from his knowledge of chemistry, knows is the acid that fixes all vegetable dyes. There you find, in one stratum, a clay which makes a beautiful garnet red brick; in the next, a nice brown; then a beautiful golden yellow; and, at the top, a snow white (Hear, hear!). There is the material and the character and the profuseness of this supply. I am satisfied that when the country comes to be settled, the towns and villages there will be the handsomest, the most durable, and the cheapest that were ever constructed on this continent, and that we will have ornamental buildings of material much more beautiful, because it takes a better polish, as indestructible, and at much less cost to the producer than the ordinary limestone rubble wall of Ottawa. So much as to the building material.

Average Manitoba Indian chiefs have been desolating our Northwest, and plundering and pillaging our territories. American papers tell of secret organizations drilling on the prairie beyond the limits of our towns, in the midnight breeze of a Northern blizzard. Whole armies of distracted settlers are described as pouring across the line into Dakota, fleeing from a detestable monopoly and an accursed agricultural duty. A despotic government is represented as imprisoning and persecuting publishers of military proclamations and movers of secessionist resolutions. The impression east, if any credence is placed in these assertions, of Manitoba must be a wonderful one indeed. Certainly, the Northwest is not in want of advertising.

The local home opened last Thursday and adjourned until today. The speech from the throne contained nothing of grave importance. Thousands who attended the opening went away disappointed. The talk upon the streets is considerable, and some stormy scenes in the House are looked for.

THE PLANTING OF TREES

A new word, forestry, formerly a mere dictionary word, and hazily that even, has come into our common daily speech, and we hear of forestry congresses, schools of forestry, and various applications of it which indicate altogether a change of sentiment on the subject of trees. For centuries the dweller on this continent looked upon the forests that overshadowed so much of its surface as a barrier in the way of his progress which had to be removed. So, with might and main, the pioneers everywhere assailed them, and ruthlessly to right and to left a path was hewn out for advancing civilization. It was long before any practical man discovered that such indiscriminate slaughter of the trees of the forest was a mistake, and those who first uttered words of warning received small attention. Only when the great treeless plains of the west, overswept by icy blizzards, made the newcomers regret the grove shelters of the east, did men begin to realize the blunder of making havoc among those natural protectors. Other regrets followed in time as it was discovered that not only for warding off storms in winter and heat in summer, not only as fuel and building material, but as serving an admirable purpose in connection with climate and temperature and the distribution of rainfall and other features of the wondrous economy of nature, the destruction of the trees in the usual wholesale fashion was a waste of resources of which the consequences could not fail to be widely injurious. During the last few years, this conviction has gradually spread over the whole of North America (not to speak of other countries), and with it has come a desire to repair, as far as possible, the mischief done, as well by putting restrictions on the cutting of timber and taking other measures for its preservation as by giving all possible encouragement to forest renovation and tree-planting where needed. It is not necessary to recount all that has been done in this direction during the last few years. Suffice it to say that both in the United States and our own provinces, governments and people have fully awakened to the advisability of vigilance in preventing further waste and of fruitful effort in reforestation, and what the public now requires to know is exactly what, where, and how to plant so as to effect most good. Anyone who would compile a handy volume or manual on the subject, giving intelligibly and concisely all needful directions on those points would surely, one might think, be performing a task of universally recognized utility. Nor, perhaps, could anyone be found better fitted to undertake it than the zealous and active chief of the forestry division in the Department of Agriculture at Washington.

1884-05-23: H. Kgeleston, of Washington, who said that the value of timber lands was of two kinds: first, a commercial value, which varied with situation and its vicinity to market and the demand for lumber, and secondly, their value with reference to climate, etc., that no money could represent. He deprecated the fact that the government had put the same value on timber lands as they did on the lands swept by blizzards, and took the ground that the government ought to suspend all sales of timber lands until they ascertained what needed to be preserved and what needed to be sold. He recommended the adoption of the system prevailing in Canada of selling the timber only and of making such rules for the cutting of the trees as not to injure the trees which were left, and so as to keep up a perpetual supply, and said that any possible expenditure for the purpose of preserving our woodlands would be abundantly warranted. The forest product of the United States was valued at $700,000,000 a year, and the following statement would show its value in comparison with other products in the year 1880: 

- Forest crop: $700,000,000
- Indian corn: $614,784,000
- Wheat: $474,017,630
- Hay: $371,840,004
- Oats: $160,184,585
- Potatoes: $61,062,814
- Tobacco: $15,414,515
- Barley: $10,000,012
- Rye: $1,181,542
- Buckwheat: $8,844,488
- Cotton: $290,306,142
- Non-precious minerals, such as coal, iron, copper, lead, and zinc ore: $143,504,312
- Gold and silver: $74,490,220

The third paper was by Mr.

1884-07-24: A syndicate is doing grave injury to bona fide settlers in refusing to accept the raising of stock as the equivalent for the cropping of land. Thus far, the raising of grain has been but problematical, while success has attended cattle raising. Surely the ownership of 50 or 60 head of cattle with 160 acres cropped is as genuine proof of bona fide settlement as to have 120 acres cropped with no livestock. To invest in stock means to abridge the ability of the average farmer for extended cultivation, so that the present contract with settlers is a practical prohibition to investing in stock and therefore is unfriendly to the farmer's prosperity. As I understand the matter, for one to be able to retain a syndicate half section, 160 acres must be cropped the fourth year of his contract or else seed much of it down or let what was formerly cropped run to weed. But in the meantime, the poor hard-working settler does not know what meadow will prove hardy enough, and no consideration will be given to any hindrance he may have sustained in using his funds for stock to utilize the pasture and buy when secured. I have seen somewhere in print that the company would make special arrangements with settlers who might wish to unite stock raising with grain growing, but on application to the company, I find they are not favorable to it. A more liberal policy would certainly be in the interest of permanent settlement.

THE INDIAN QUESTION is a difficult and troublesome one, and oft-times comes up there. His well-known revengeful spirit and predatory habits are a source of constant uneasiness to settlers. The opinion is gaining ground that unless the police force is very much increased wherever there is a reserve, actual hostilities are sure to break out on some of the occasions when an ill-equipped and inadequate force is sent to take Indian prisoners. The real spirit of the Indian may be correctly gathered from what took place last winter at the Qu'Appelle Valley. I received the facts from an eyewitness, one of the settlers, who drove the police force from Broadview, a distance of sixteen miles, to the shanty down in the valley, where the stolen flour and bacon were stored and guarded by an armed body of determined Indians. I drove to the place, and from a projecting eminence was regaled with a grand panoramic view of the valley and deep gully through which alone vehicles can gain access to the plain beneath. At that place, the valley is some miles in width and in the long ago had been the bed of a majestic river, which now is dwindled to a mere creek meandering in serpentine course among reeds and brush through the middle of the plain. The banks are high, rocky, and steep, bare and bleak on the north side, but thick-wooded on the southern slopes. They afford almost complete protection from the blizzard that may be devastating everything in the prairie overhead. The gully is about a half mile in length, tortuous, densely wooded on both sides, and the narrow pass along which the police had to enter or escape has deep ruts, huge stones, and stumps of trees, rendering it all but impassable for horse or vehicle. Two miles along the valley is the shanty in which was stored the stolen booty, consisting of flour and bacon, and within were a number of warriors armed with leaded rifles, and without an interpreter. The chief dismounted and approached the door, making his mission known through the interpreter to an Indian decked in feathers and red paint and armed with a club and rifle who guarded the doorway. The chief and the handful of men with him had only revolvers, but he was brave and demanded the restoration of the stolen property and the surrender of the thieves. The warrior, bent on resistance, peremptorily refused, well knowing that the police were entirely at his mercy. Becoming audacious, he approached the chief of police and struck his hatchet into the ground across the approach to the door and challenged him to cross on pain of instant death. The chief hesitated for a time, tried negotiation, which only increased the Indian's contempt, for he took the hatchet and stuck it within a foot of the chief, repeating his challenge. Construing it into mere bravado, the chief advanced, and in an instant door and window bristled with the muzzles of rifles aimed at him. In another moment he would have been a dead man but for the brave and timely intervention of a squaw, Mrs. Papiano. She yelled as only a squaw can, and rushed on the rifles, throwing them upward and preventing any firing. Had one shot been fired at that moment, not a white man would have escaped alive, so furious were the Indians and anxious for the affray. Mrs. Papiano was wise as she was brave. I saw her at the government storehouse. She is a big woman of commanding appearance, and on the occasion of the difficulty in question, she was dressed in black silk. She counseled patience and submission on the part of the Indians and a wise forbearance from the white man. She made a telling speech, and her advice was taken. So sure of trouble and so complete were the arrangements of the Indians that the place was held by a body of riflemen in ambush, to whom intelligence of passing events was conveyed by scouts on horseback, thus calling off the possibility of escape from any of the party. That blood did not flow on that occasion is due entirely to the efforts of Mrs. Papiano. Many interesting incidents which occurred on the frontier could be narrated, but my letter is already long enough. Settlers in the Northwest may have many hardships to encounter, but the country is bound to be thickly peopled, and that with one of the most intelligent and thriving populations on the face of the world.

1884-09-16: I had found two or three discontented, and when I pressed them for the reasons of their discontent, they had told me it was because they had got no ladies in their section of the country, and were, therefore, lonely. I had advised them to go east and see sure that if they were satisfied with their wives, and he was sure that if they did so, they would return to everything. Only a day or so ago, I had a conversation with a very prominent gentleman in the opposition camp, and he told me that the political blizzard had swept over the country, and that at the next election the opposition would be returned to power. It was the first time that I had heard the action of the free electors spoken of as a political blizzard, but if it was so, it was strange that another political blizzard should have swept over the country in 1881! A voice said, "Next time it will be a cyclone!" (Loud cheers.) He believed that the next election would be a cyclone if the last two were blizzards, and that it would lead the Conservative party into power for another five years. (Cheers.) He was sure that the people preferred getting their goods cheaper and manufactured in their own country, and he was sure they would express confidence in a government which put money into their pockets instead of showing them a big deficit. He thanked the company on behalf of himself and Sir John A. Macdonald, and was quite sure that the latter would pay Manitoba a visit when the Canadian Pacific Railway reached Lake Superior, and he hoped he would be able to accompany him. He was sure that when the chieftain did come, he would meet with a reception such as he always met with. Sir Hector resumed his seat amidst enthusiastic cheering.

1884-12-23: CHAMBER EMIGRANTS TO THE SOUTH. New York Chamber of Commerce posed to the Spanish Treaty. On December 22, natural gas has been playing havoc in different places in western Pennsylvania. Within twenty-four hours, reports of explosions attended with fatal and serious results have been received from Butler and Washington, while in this city, a building occupied as a grocery store was completely demolished last evening. At Washington, Pa., the residence of William Kabe was partly wrecked, and Kabe, his wife, and child were injured badly. All have since died. Mrs. Kabe arose in the night and went into the cellar with a lighted candle when an explosion occurred. The excitement in Washington is intense, as many people have natural gas in their houses. The explosion at Butler occurred yesterday morning and nearly ended in a horrible disaster. The fine brick residence of John Gates was entirely demolished, and the family, consisting of Gates, his wife, and four children, all grown up, were buried in the ruins. The entire family was rescued, all more or less seriously hurt. They retired at 10 o'clock, and two hours later, Winnie, a daughter aged 20, awoke and noticed a tiny blue flame playing on the hearthstone. She put it out; she then called her brother, who, with a light, went to further investigate. He had no sooner opened the door than a terrible explosion followed, and the building was razed from the foundation and came down a mass of ruins. People living a quarter of a mile away felt the shock, and in a short time willing hands were at work trying to save the lives of the six human beings known to be in the building at the time of the explosion. The first taken out was Leonard, aged 28, who was painfully bruised, though he had sustained no internal injuries. John Gates, Jr., was next found, badly burned about the face, neck, and arms. Mr. and Mrs. Gates, who escaped with several bruises, and the daughters were found in the coal vault uninjured. The escape of all from instant death is wonderful. 

CAKRAWMRB. In a collision in Chicago, December 22. The facts regarding an accident on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad near Bremen, Indiana, were made known here tonight. The train was a fast express from Washington City due here this morning. It was running at the rate of 40 miles an hour when it struck a broken rail. The engine and forward part of the train pulled over safely, but the dining car and two sleeping coaches were derailed and overturned. The dining car took fire and burned. The sleeping coaches were saved from destruction. There were sixteen persons in the sleepers, some of them public men. Congressman Shively suffered painful bruises, and all the others are more or less shaken up. The occupants of the dining car suffered severely. Edward McCabe and Jos Pratz, cooks, and Edward Gray and 11 McKaunton, waiters, were fatally lacerated, scalded, and burned. The wounded were brought here this afternoon. 

The Dakota War. Traverse, Dak., December 22. The situation is unchanged since last evening. A blizzard has been blowing. The mercury was 20 degrees below zero at noon. Traverse has scoured the county for arms, and sufficient have been secured. Men from all parts of the county are constantly arriving, and officials now feel relieved. A spy sent out this morning reports the men at Wilmotte are still trying to open the safe, but they have not succeeded. The mob will be kept under arms until the safe is opened and its contents known. If the records are not found, the mob will immediately move upon Traverse. 

The Spanish Treaty. New York, December 22. The Chamber of Commerce today heard the report of the committee to which had been referred the consideration of the Spanish treaty. The committee made three reports. The majority report recommends to the Senate and House of Representatives the prompt ratification of the Spanish treaty and the passage of an enabling act. The minority reports are opposed to the treaty. After discussion, the matter was put to a vote, and the first minority report, declaring "the Spanish-American treaty now before the Senate is hostile to the interests of the people of the United States, and ought not to be confirmed," was adopted by a close vote. 

A desk officer in trouble. Washington, December 22. Sergt. Holtnorth, of the signal service, who was sent by the Secretary of War in search of Howgate, the absconder, has returned and been relieved from duty. It is alleged that Holtnorth obtained the information which induced the Secretary of War to send him as a detective by rifling Lieutenant Greely's private papers. He will be court-martialed. 

The telephone patents. Trenton, N.J., December 22. The United States Telephone Manufacturing Company of New York, and the McDonough Telephone and Telegraph Company of New Jersey, filed a bill in the United States court this morning asking for an injunction against the American Bell Telephone Company of Boston, and the Domestic Telegraph and Telephone Company of Newark, for infringement of patent and for an accounting. 

1884-12-26: TRAIN TALK. "Guess we're going to have a free-in' winter," remarked a passenger from Iowa by way of acquaintance-making with a man from Montana. "Yes, I think we will. But cold weather has no terrors for me no more. I spent one winter up in the mountains that was so awful I've never had the gall to complain of anything since." 

"How was that?" 

"Well, 'twas three years ago. Six of us had a camp on the mountain side, in which we hibernated, as 'twas, all winter long. Nothin' to do but eat and sleep and play cards. The first day of December we started up the poker game, needing selected quartz pebbles for chips, you know. We were all pretty well heeled, having cleaned up good at the end of the season. As there'd been trouble in the camp the previous winter on account of borrowing, we all solemnly agreed that the limit should be $10, except in jackpots, and if a man got busted, nobody was to lend him. The third day we struck a big luck - I went in with two pair and filled, with kings up, and old Robinson started with two queens and got t'other two, and laid me out completely. Took my last cent, froze me out so that I couldn't put up for an ante. The boys wouldn't go back on the rule, and I couldn't borrow a cent. There wasn't no use kickin', so I just turned in to watch them play. Day after day and night after night passed with them mulling the rocks clutter and me sittin' back in the shadows lookin' on. Imagine how happy I was. Every day I got gloomier. I was an outcast, a poor miserable good-for-nothing a-pinin' for a mouthful in sight of plenty. I had just one hope left, and that was one of the others would get fried out, too, and then him and me could play a little side game all by ourselves on tick to be settled in the spring. But nary one of 'em got busted. They'd put up their last dollar many a time, but 'twas just my infernal luck that the short man would win and be able to stay in the game. I talked of committing suicide, or of going off and losing myself in a blizzard, but they wouldn't take no sort of pity on me. The rhyme of the old sailor, what I used to know by heart back in the states, kept running through my mind. Alone, alone, all, all alone, alone on a wide, wide sea. 

"Long in the fore part of February, I got desperate and started off through the snow for Helena. I was half crazy, I was. Hadn't no sort of idea where I was going between the storm and the thing that ran through my brain. I was about gone. The wind seemed to whistle, 'Raise yer, raise yer,' and the big trees seemed to cry out, 'Do yer ten rocks better, pard, ten rocks better.' I wandered around for three days and nights, half frozen and half starved, clean off my base and near done for generally. I reckon I'd died hadn't I come to a camp where a lone miner lived. He took me in, thawed me out, and asked me to play poker with him. Then I began to straighten out, but 'twas a close call, a mighty close call. 

"That, stranger, is the reason why I never complain of cold weather. If I live to be a thousand years old, the coldest winter in all my record will be that one when I got froze out of the game up at Grizzly Bear Gulch." 

"I see in the paper," said an old engineer, "that they have arrested a Nickel-Plate driver over in Indiana for failing to stop his train at a grade crossing in time to prevent an accident. His defense is that the rails were slippery. This reminds me of one of my own experiences, several years ago. I was running a fast express one night. We were three hours behind time, and if there's anything in the world I hate, it's to finish a run behind schedule. These grade crossings of one-horse roads are a nuisance to the trunk line, and we had a habit of failing to stop, merely slacking up for 'em. At this crossing, I had never seen a train at that time of the night, and so I roared the curve out of the car full tilt. I was astonished to see the target set against me, though I had time enough to stop. But it was a downgrade there, and the track was very slippery, and to add to the danger, my air didn't work right. I whistled sharply to clear the target set clear for me, but on looking, I saw that a freight train was standing right over the crossing, evidently intending to put a few cars on our switch. I wish I could tell you what my thoughts were at that moment. I knew the danger and tried to slow my train, but I had seven heavy cars on, and we just slid down that grade despite everything I could do. 

"Now comes the opening part of my story. Quicker than I can tell you, the brakeman on that freight train occupied a car just back of our engine and signaled his engineer to back off, which he did sharply, but just in time to let us through. In fact, the pilot of my engine took the buffer off that rear car. Through that little hole, we slipped, and lives and property were saved. Now that brakeman was only a common railroader, yet he saw that situation at a glance. There wasn't time to run his whole train off the crossing, nor even half of it; barely time to pull up one car-length by prompt, quick work. He kept his wits about him, as I venture to say not one man in a thousand would have done, and saved my reputation, if not my life. He is now a division superintendent on one of the best roads in this country; and may good luck go with him." 

"Home folks don't seem to have any sense about getting off cars," remarked the brakeman. "Every once in a while, some man will jump off and hurt himself when a little common sense would teach him better. Some years ago, I was running on an express on the New York Central. Just as we go into Rochester, we cross Hudson Street. One night as we were running in, at the rate of about eighteen miles an hour, I was standing on the rear platform. A tall, well-dressed man with a shiny plug hat and an elegant valise came out and inquired if that was Hudson Street. I told him it was, and before I knew what he was doing, he jumped. I looked back quick and saw him strike the ground. Then he leaped as if he had been thrown out of a cannon at least twenty feet, turning a half somersault and landing on his head in the mud. Then he rolled over six or eight times. The mud at Hudson Street was about three inches deep, and when this man picked himself up, he was an object. He looked as if he was made of mud. The last glimpse I had of him, he had both hands up trying with all his might to shove his plug hat up off his shoulders. I'd have laughed even if I'd known he was dying, which he wasn't, but I'll bet he gets off at stations now."

Some mining company. He was full of indignation at the delays of the law in Eastern courts. "It took me three months," he said, "to get a little formality through that ought to have been settled in twenty-four hours. It worried the life out of me. Now, in Arizona we don't do things that way. Our courts move quick. We haven't so much style or red tape, and believe that when a thing has to be done, the way to get it done is to go right at it and rush it. I remember last spring the Judge came to our place to hold court. There was a jail full of fellows there in for murder and horse-stealing. The Judge was in a hurry and said that docket must be cleared within twenty-four hours. Well, it was. Now, in the world did he do it?" "He didn't do it. That night the boys organized a little committee, took the prisoners out of jail, hung the horse-thief, and told the murderers to get out of the territory. Next morning the judge signed the docket and cost bills and went on his way rejoicing." 

A passenger on a train up in Wisconsin was complaining of hard times. "I don't see nothing but ruin about them," remarked a contented-looking man opposite him. "Well, you're the first man I've seen that wasn't growling," replied the first speaker, "and I should like to know your business. If there is one prosperous man in the country, I want to make his acquaintance. What do you do?" "Oh, I'm working for the railroad company, watching the wood contractor to see that they don't pile in no poor stuff. Got $2 a day." "Two dollars a day! You don't call that prosperous, do you?" "Oh, that ain't all. The contractors pay me $5 a day to spend three-fourths of my time down at a Jackson saloon. Nothing hard about these times that I can see." 

**District of Montreal**

1885-01-03: C, January 2. Paymaster Smyth, who disappeared from Savannah with $5,500 government funds, appeared at the war department today and surrendered himself to the paymaster-general. He turned over $5,150 of money carried off by him and his pay for December, $250, and $100 paid for him by his friends, making the full amount of $5,500. Smythe says he went on a spree on Christmas Day and knew nothing of his actions until he found himself in New York. He then telegraphed to his clerk that he would return immediately. He afterwards, however, concluded to come to Washington and report to the paymaster-general. 

**The Cold and the Cattle** 
St. Paul, January 2. Last night and today have been the coldest of the present winter, and among the coldest on record. The signal office thermometer this morning registered 36 below; others showed 50 below. Reports from other points are as follows: Stillwater, 50 below, the coldest ever known; Lacrosse, 23; Bismarck, 45; Minnedosa, 50; Winnipeg, 55, and a regular blizzard prevailing. A Bozeman, Montana, despatch says: Reports from the stock ranges are most discouraging. Snow is two feet deep on the level, and the cattle are starving. Many fine herds will be annihilated if the cold snap be repeated. 

**Train Robbers in the East** 
Baltimore, January 2. The train which left here over the Baltimore Central railroad for Oxford, Pa, at 5:10 this afternoon was boarded at Rising Sun, Cecil County, by two men who, by threats of violence, compelled the passengers to surrender their money, watches, and other valuables; they then jumped from the train, which was running full speed, and were supposed to be seriously, if not fatally, injured. No particulars could be obtained of the identity of the men, but they are supposed to be residents of the immediate neighborhood and will be captured. 

**A Wife's Despair** 
Macidon, N.

1885-01-23: I came in beneath the wharves and shipping, the fir-clad hills and grainy plains along in the distance making up a panorama, never to be forgotten or surpassed. The grass was alive with long-tails that flew up at every step, exhibiting the dainty colors of their hinder wings; grasshoppers, indescribably lovely swallowtail butterflies, mixed with others of bright yellow and rich red, enlivened the scene and added the welcome charm of life (we had missed so much on the voyage) to the view. 

The drive to Lorette, and the trip in the steamer to Montreal are described. The Windsor receives favorable notice, "the only drawback being the laziness of the white waiters, who proved a sore trial to our English patience." After a description of this city, which is described as "the chief town in Canada," the lecturer referred to the trip from Montreal to Ottawa. "From Montreal we proceeded to Ottawa, the seat of the government, traveling by the Grand Trunk railway, through scenery that struck us as intensely Canadian, wooden houses built with longitudinal planks up to the eaves, the gables being filled in with upright boards and the roof covered with wooden shingles; enclosures small and crops fairly good, though in some places badly weeded; wooden rail fences in all directions made without rails or spikes; all the posts are double, the nails between them being packed on short transverse logs. In some places, wire is used as the old rails wear out or become rotten. To prevent straying, horses, pigs, cattle, and poultry are provided with yokes. 

Near Coteau, the view is particularly agreeable, the St. Lawrence on one hand, studded with islands, and the Ottawa River on the other. This was the scene of the boatman's song, 'Row, brothers, row,' the rapids being close by. From this point, the country became more closely covered with thick woods of firs and undergrowth, the successors of the primeval forest. These are being cleared as fast as possible, the first process being one of fire which destroys the bark for a few feet from the ground and kills the trees so treated; these stems stand up gaunt and grey awaiting the lumberer's axe or heavy gale to bring them to the ground. The leaves of the maple were already assuming the delicious red so characteristic of the Canadian fall, whilst other foliage was a brilliant yellow. 

After visiting the public buildings, we drove to the Chaudière Falls, in the suburbs of Ottawa, and in themselves worth seeing, to inspect the lumber mills for which they supply the power; the huge logs that have floated down the stream are guided by men with boat hooks, end-on to an endless toothed chain, that lifts the log and drags it up an inclined plane to the saw sheds and deposits it on a platform. Here it is rolled onto a carriage that runs it through a set of saws which cut off the slabs or outer pieces and one or two planks on each side, leaving a half-finished baulk in the middle. No sooner is it clear of this first set of saws than it is rolled again onto another carriage close by and turned through more saws that complete the work; the planks are placed on other machinery that draws them through saws set at 13 feet apart, the odd ends falling into choppers on each side and thence are conveyed under the floor to a match factory where they are at once utilized. 

The run to Toronto, the city itself, the trip to Niagara Falls, and its incidents were all described, and then the trip to the Rockies is referred to: "The next day the Rocky Mountain excursion under the auspices of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company started early for Owen Sound. The intervening country was well cultivated, but mixed with large tracts of dead stems and stumps filled in with wild brightly colored red and yellow undergrowth; birds, as usual, were scarce. On arriving at Owen Sound, we at once went on board the Canadian Pacific Railway steamer, Alberta (a most comfortable vessel with luxurious saloon reaching from stem to stem, the state rooms opening into it, the whole ship illuminated by the Edison Electric Light), and leaving the sound entered Georgian Bay, the low shores of which were composed of limestone resting on a bed of gravel. Lake Huron was crossed during the night. 

In the morning, we entered the narrows, known as the River St. Marie that connects with Lake Superior, the banks were clothed with fir, pine, and birch trees, the waters being dotted with settlers' dwellings. The Canadian bank is occupied by the tribe of Ojibbeway Indians, 10,000 in number, who are especially numerous about Garden River. They bury their dead, bound up in birch bark, just below the surface of the ground in an open grave, supplying the corpse with tobacco, and covering all in with a gabled thatch. Several huts were abundant on the banks, huts built of logs dressed only with an axe, the interstices being carefully stopped with grey clay. The course was now intricately marked with stakes between which the Alberta wound her way to the lock at Sault Ste. Marie already described in speaking of the canals. Close by there were the dashing rapids on which Indians are constantly catching whitefish with large hand nets from their skillfully managed birch bark canoes. A magnificent view was had over the water, and a few canoes and gulls were visible in the distance. Shortly after passing the Sault, we stood in view of this inland sea, and all sight of land was speedily lost. This Lake Superior is as large as Ireland. As evening closed upon us, a number of islands, in sight, were about 30 miles away, in full view. The next morning was misty, but revealed the bold and majestic headland known as Thunder Cape, and formed of volcanic rock, which we sailed past in entering Fort Arthur. 

A description of Fort Arthur, which the party availed of for boarding and general gathering, and then proceeded to Winnipeg. 

**WINNIPEG TO THE INTERIOR** 
The description of Winnipeg and the trip westward was given only slightly condensed. The name Winnipeg implies muddy water, and Winnipeg mud is famous in Canada for its tenacity. The depth of it in the main street (a wide span thoroughfare with excellent lumber sidewalks, lofty and well-built, with telephone and telegraph wires innumerable) is simply appalling, with wagons turning about like vessels at sea, the vehicles scarcely clearing the surface, which was broken into irregularities that gave the effect of rough Atlantic waves. Here and there the railways were ploughing it in vain, if possible, into a permanent flat surface; the redeeming feature is a single tram line that runs down the center, and occasional timber crossings that are used as bridges for the passengers. 

An exhibition here of splendid Indian apparel, weapons, and handicraft had been brought together and was displayed by the side of a collection of native work from the Hudson's Bay Company, with which they would not even bear comparison. The fruit and vegetables were excellent, wheat plants with 12 stalks on each, cabbages 10 lbs a piece, and numerous...

**In the Kindness of the Climate and the Business of the Country**

As the proper journey began, the landscape of the country changed from interminable forest to wide and open treeless prairie. Tons of shucked wheat were seen close by the line. The soil and subsoil were sandy in nature. At a distance, extensive cattle pens implied ample pasturage. This being a typical western city deserves description; wide and straight avenues laid out on a large scale; churches, stores, and hotels, several still in construction, but at long intervals; the tracks sloppy and overgrown with rank weeds and herbage, on either side avenues of young trees planted by the enterprise of the inhabitants who devote one day a year to the task. Telephones and electric light wires overhead indicated a scientific advance on the arrangements of the old country.

At Carberry, we saw our first genuine buckboard or cart of the country, a characteristic conveyance, consisting of a board extending from the axle of the front to that of the hind pair of wheels. On this, the seat fixed over ordinary carriage springs is mounted, and so elastic and easy is this that one can drive with comfort over any irregularity the circle of the wheel can climb. Here a few bluffs or small clusters of undergrowth, principally young birch, relieved the landscape, and at Brandon, a one-year-old city of four or five thousand inhabitants, the land rose into a gentle but considerable eminence. Brilliant red and yellow buttercups, gentian, and wild lobelia attracted both entomologists and botanists, and a large handsomely black-spotted edible frog proved an object of universal interest. A few miles further, the bluffs had again disappeared, and nothing but prairie was visible, not a tree in sight, a sunbleached brownish-yellow waste of coarse short herbage, broken here and there by a patch of ploughed land, turned to secure the government rebate of a dollar and a quarter per acre. Ospreys, herons, martins, and sparrow hawks, grey and black ducks, widgeon and teal in the sloughs, and an occasional bittern in the marshes, with here and there a covey of prairie chickens that flew heavily for a short distance and then scuttled and ran, a train of mounted Indians passing by, another group with their wagons, a couple driving a buckboard drawn by two mustangs, a colt running alongside, all gave a distinctive character to the landscape as our train ran quickly by.

At Broadview, the next halt on our track, we found about a dozen Cree Indians—bucks, squaws, and papooses—the latter bound up like mummies being carried in a shawl on the backs of the squaws and girls, whose heavy yellow and red ochred faces contrasted with the clear brilliance of their dark brown eyes; plenty of cheap native-made ornaments, such as earrings, bead leggings, finger rings, and wire bangles decorated their limbs, and each was wrapped in bright-colored but dirty blankets, behind the folds of which they retired if looked at too curiously. Wild geese, plover, dotterel, a couple of rabbits, and one or two long-furred black and white skunks shuffling clumsily into a small bluff enlivened the next few miles. Indians were fairly numerous, owing to a government reserve being close by, and shortly after we reached the celebrated Bell farm, containing 64,000 acres, 7,000 being under wheat in tracts of from 100 to 3,000 acres each; the harvest is gathered by 27 horse reapers and other machinery in proportion. The average yield here, it being the second year of cultivation, is 11 bushels per acre, but when the sod is rotted, 60 bushels at 74 cents a bushel are expected. The land prepared in the autumn is sown with 15 bushels to the acre the moment the spring thaw gives a few inches of surface. The soil, black and rich with dead vegetable matter, buffalo remains, and prairie fire ashes, is some three feet deep; below this, there is 18 or 20 feet of good clay, producing excellent yellow bricks, and under this again is water. The surface drainage runs into the coulees or hollows, under the shelter of which a certain amount of timber grows. Laborers receive $20 per month and their keep for five summer months; during the winter, they can work in the forest lumbering at $25 to $30 per month, and there is a call and room for 50,000 at the present time.

Since leaving Manitoba, the whole country is remarkably temperate, tea and coffee being the accepted beverages at all meals, tough beefsteak appearing three times a day. At Regina, the future capital of the far west, we visited the barracks of the mounted police by the invitation of their chief, Colonel Irvine. These men are splendidly mounted and equipped, their uniform resembling that of the Grenadiers, but their stirrups are made of wood as being less cold to the feet in winter. In the guardroom, a number of Indian prisoners, mostly undergoing punishment for horse stealing, were confined; these were by far the finest men we had seen, their names suspended by their cage door and were curious, implying Little Fish, Great Rock, Frog's Thigh, and Empty Belly, etc. These barracks are built in a large quadrangle, about a mile distant from the town; the officers told us the life was pleasant enough with the exception of the blizzards or drift storms.

Just beyond here at Moosejaw, we entered the third prairie plateau, the surface of the country becoming slightly undulating, and as we approached Medicine Hat, the train followed the line of a prairie valley, an ancient riverbed bounded on either side at a distance of 400 or 500 yards by a low range of sand hills so closely packed as to present an almost unbroken skyline. The weather was bright and clear, the air pure and bracing; on quitting this, we glided down a steep grade into a modern valley, where a sparkling river was winding backwards and forwards in a flat and strong area, bounded by lofty cliffs. On its banks, poplar trees of considerable height were flourishing, and a couple of teams were dragging heavily-laden ploughs towards the town, which is admirably situated on the river. The river is close here by a handsome iron bridge, upon which swings on a central fulcrum for river traffic; on its banks, extensive sections of Victoria’s rim-head rocks occur, and the remains of dinosaurs have been discovered there. The track from this point misses and crosses the river, a pleasant change from the monotony of the prairie and not far from the "village," where the railway company was boring for water, and at a depth of 100 feet they tapped a vast supply of water, which has been utilized in steam for an engine which now works the pumping-station.

On the date of our visit, September 11th, 1884, no water had been found at the depth of 185 feet. At Calgary, the center of the ranching interest, one hundred and fifty miles south of which our old neighbors, the Darnells, have a considerable establishment, the presence of the Bow River quite changes the aspect of the country; trees were abundant and high banks bounded the valley. Mounted cowboys with their lariats or tether ropes, hung lasso fashion on the pommel peg, were dotted by the trackside, and as the snowy peaks of the yet distant Rocky Mountains topped the horizon, we felt all the pleasure the achievement of a set design yields. It was dark when we reached Canmore, where we snuggled over the roughest of ground to the log hut in which our fifty-cent supper was prepared. On emerging, our train, beautifully lighted, was an imposing sight, and gave the impression that they here boasted some extensive manufacturing.

When we woke next morning, it was to find ourselves at Laggan, two miles beyond Stephen, the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, 5,000 feet above the sea, and consequently on the Bow River valley. The negro attendant assuring us that it is “All lovely, gentlemen, plenty gold and silver.” This is a considerable railway village, composed of hills and tents placarded with huge titles, such as "The most fashionable tailor," "Ting Sing Chinese laundry," or even more humorous "Tea and treacle," "Edibles," "Dollar beans," "Candy," "Bunks," and "Gimlets," whiskey and other things. We were now, by special favor, taken on to Kicking Horse Pass and Lake, the hills and woods being very beautiful on either side. Three miles further, by the side of the winding valley, a belt of white and hard shingle that serves as the great high road is a bustling city, where a canvas tent is labeled "Grand Central Hotel." The view here is perfect, impenetrable forest of fir clothe the sides of the valley for 2,000 feet in dense allure. Above it, in the ravines lie huge accumulations of snow and ice, and yet above these towers the magnificent peaks and aiguilles that render these mountains of British Columbia so imposing and impressive.

This lecture is but one of the many evidences which we have of the increased interest in Canada, and the better knowledge of the country which is certain to result from the visit of the British Association.

**THE LINE NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR**

It appears difficult to realize that the line north of Lake Superior will, in the course of two or three months, be open for traffic. For many years past, the wisdom of the construction of this portion of the great transcontinental line has been debated. The country to be traversed has been depicted as of the roughest and most uninviting character, and the expense placed at such an excessive figure that more than once it has been stated that the Syndicate were not likely ever to proceed with the work. Meantime, for much of the year, the freight and passenger business of the Canadian Northwest has passed over American roads by a rather circumlocutory route, and over four or more different railroad systems. Every resident of, and visitor to, the Northwest has become accustomed to the inevitable, and, on the whole, pleasant detours in St. Paul and Chicago, and many connections of a business and social character have thereby been formed. An acquaintance has also been scraped with customs officers which otherwise would not have been of so intimate a character.

The first break in this chain of association occurred when the lake route was opened out, and now almost a revolution is threatened by the opening of the all-Canadian rail route. No doubt the American system will still secure a portion of the business, probably a large share until the Ontario system of railroads has been connected with the Canadian Pacific, but the time is nevertheless close at hand when Fortage, Port Arthur, Callendar, Pembroke, Ottawa, etc., will be more familiar names to the traveler between Eastern Canada and Manitoba than are St. Paul, Chicago, Port Huron, or St. Thomas. The trip from Winnipeg to Montreal will soon be made without change of cars, and the time now occupied in both passenger and freight transportation will be reduced nearly, if not quite, one-half. With reduced time should come a reduction in passenger tariffs and freight rates. The cost of living in...

This country should be "considerably" reduced, and the farmer should in another year get relatively better prices for his grain than at present. Canadian travellers will no longer blush for their country when told that their money is at a discount of from two to eight percent, and burly Manitobans will not receive the imprecations of their fellow passengers if they ask to have the car windows opened when the mercury is hovering about the vicinity of zero. The Toronto and Montreal papers, and all Eastern Canada correspondence, will be at least a day "fresher" than they are at the present time, and in very many ways the long distance from old associations which many now feel will be perceptibly lessened. In summer the route is pretty sure to be a popular one, partly because of the water stretch which it offers to travellers, but in the winter it will be of rather a monotonous character, and it will require all the inducements of quick time and low fares which the Canadian Pacific people can offer to secure the passenger traffic. With most people, however, time and money are powerful persuaders, and when placed in the scale against sightseeing are almost certain to tip the beam. It will be an immense satisfaction, in any event, to get two-thirds of the way to Montreal in the time which is now consumed in accomplishing the equally dreary journey between this city and St. Paul. 

Winnipeg Times - Every woman in the land owes it to herself and her family to take care of her health. When she finds her health failing, and debility and weakness undermine her strength, her surest and best remedy is Kidney-Wort. It builds up the general health, keeps the secretory system in perfect order, regulates the kidneys and bowels, and enables these important organs to perform their natural functions in throwing off the accumulated impurities of the body. 

The Empire Pottery and Brewers' Pottery, at Trenton, N.

1885-01-29: I. O. M., January 28. Sir Charles held a conference today with delegates from the Chamber of Commerce and trade unions upon the subject of wages. Sir Charles said memorials proposing final, but not communistic, change in the laws regulating the relations between capital and labor would be submitted to parliament.

Fishermen in Nova Scotia, January 28. A terrific blizzard began yesterday on the west coast of Nova Scotia. A large number of fishing crafts were overtaken by the storm. Twenty-three skiffs are missing and many of the survivors are badly frostbitten. One skiff went down in sight with the crew. The crews of the missing vessels aggregate fifty men. There are grave fears that the loss of life will be heavy.

1885-02-23: LOSSES ON CATTLE RANCHES. The severity of winter and the devastating blizzards have made fearful havoc in the western ranches. From Southwestern Texas to Montana and Dakota, they all alike have suffered, whilst strange to say north of the 49th parallel of latitude, in our own Northwest there has been comparative immunity from any heavy losses by storms, owing no doubt to the protection afforded by the Rocky Mountains and the warm winds which blow over the region. The losses that have occurred on the American side are such as to cripple a great many of their largest stockmen and will have a pronounced effect upon the cattle and sheep interests of the country. Both fat and stock cattle may be expected to be scarce, as it will take a few years of breeding to make up the losses of the season. In relation to this, an American exchange says, "It is a poor time to sell sheep or go out of the business when thousands upon thousands of sheep are being frozen and starved to death in the far west, and when an unusual number are being slaughtered at all leading markets. Farmers may rest assured, that it is low tide in sheep husbandry, and now is the time to take advantage of the rising tide which is sure to follow." The same advice is applicable to our farmers in Ontario, for what affects one country affects the other with regard to the prices of mutton and wool, for our surplus both here and there go to a common market. But without the heavy losses in the west to affect prices, the sheep supply in Ontario is and would be at low ebb, and we want more to meet the demand. There never was a better opening for both good sheep and cattle, both fat and as carrying stock.

1885-02-25: T. Lambert, who engaged the Canadian voyageurs, left for Hull this morning to meet them on their return. Capt. Almond is the only officer who returns with them. A stabbing affair took place today between two Italian laborers, one of whom will probably die. Two Toronto whiskey manufacturers, who are operating here, met with severe treatment in a city hotel, being assaulted by five or six men. One of the Torontonians threw a revolver and saved himself and his friend from what turned out to be a very unpleasant experience. 

The report states that all the labor disputes which paralyze business and make life difficult for others and employees persist, says the London Advertiser, the worst, in his zeal, in its things is the very prince of the powers of the air. It is a stormy snow that has already fallen; it is a flood whose billows reach up to the sky; it is a tornado the swath of which is a mile wide, and besides all of these it is a cold which scans out the heart and marrow of man and his olive and bird and beast. In the true blizzard, the sky is clear and only now and then partially obscured by small white clouds, or rather rags of mist which fly off it. The wind comes from none of the quarters in which storms are bred; it blows from the blue western spaces with an edge that cuts like a sword. It is not a steady wind. Now it is almost gentle, were it not for its edge of steel, but every few minutes it rises and roars and sweeps on with howls and shrieks, and every living thing shivers and shrinks from its fierce onslaught and seeks for shelter. And the snow which had fallen a day or two before is at once the plaything and the tremendous weapon of the blizzard. In its play, it catches up handfuls of the fine white crystals here and there and flings them before it and seems to laugh at their splendid gleaming in the sunlight. But in a few moments its nature changes; it suddenly flings up great clouds of snow into the air; the sky and even the sun are hidden; the hollow of the heavens is filled with roaring as the wind drives on the vast white billows, whose spray stings like a whip as it beats against whoever tries to face it. It is such storms that railway men in the Northwest have to face and fight. For the blizzard is the peculiar enemy of the railway. It opposes its swiftness to the speed of the trains, its cold to the heat of locomotive furnaces, its wide sweep to the narrowness of the track. The cost of fighting one of these blizzards is enormous. Every cut on the line is filled to the brim with snow that is often packed like sand. But it does not require a deep cut to enable the blizzard to stop trains. A foot, even six inches, of the packed drift will bring them to a standstill. The snowplow may be forced through by a long line of pulling locomotives, but before the train that follows can get well under way, the snow has sifted in again and progress is impossible. And the blizzard brings accidents and wrecks in great numbers. The flying snow and the clouds of steam make it almost impossible for the engineer to see signals. On each division, a snowplow must be kept at work, and from four to eight locomotives are required to push it. A few days ago it required fourteen engines to get a short train of five cars to the yards in Chicago. 

NOTES: An effort will probably be made at the present session of the North Carolina legislature to secure the adjustment of $16,000,000 bonds, which are repudiated by the state. The bonds were issued in aid of railroads. The railroads of the West are again in first-class condition; after the blizzard, revenues for 1881 were $3,303,000, and the net profit $2,805,000.

**Minor items**  
Oliver Wendell Holmes, aged 16, hanged himself at Lakewood, N.J. Fairbairn, No. 4 Corn Exchange, reports the Chicago grain and produce markets as follows:

| Commodity | Mar | April | May |
|-----------|-----|-------|-----|
| Wheat     | $0.78 | $0.77 | $0.78 |
| Oats      | $0.775 | $0.92 | - |
| Corn      | $0.62 | $0.68 | $0.32 |
| Barley    | $0.38 | $0.11 | $0.27 |
| Flour     | $12.65 | $12.07 | $12.78 |
| Pork      | $6.85 | $6.11 | $7.02 |
| Lard      | $0.81 | $0.37 | $0.38 |

In the grain market, there were no new developments, neither was there anything of interest, the general tone being dull and flat, with business limited to supplying the local demand. Along the line, there is some movement, but not of an unusual character. 

On the spot, we quote nominally: Canadian red winter wheat, 66c; white winter, 69c; Canada spring, 67c; peas, 70c-75c; oats, 32c; rye, 38c; barley, 60c-65c; and corn, 61c-63c. The movement of flour is light and restricted, limited to odd lots for the haul trade. There was little business of importations today, and the finding continues weak, values having a tendency to slide through the absence of demand. 

Flour prices range from $4.15 to $4.75, depending on quality, and superior is offered at $5.05, and less would probably be accepted. 

**Flour Prices**  
Superior Flour: $4.15  
Extra Spring: $4.75  
Superfine Canada: $4.00  
Bakers' American: $4.90  

**Hogs**  
The hog market was weak, under heavier receipts, and declined 5-10c. At the close, quotations were $4.25-$4.50 for light grades, $4.50-$4.70 for mixed packing, and $4.70-$5.05 for heavy shipping. The estimated receipts were 29,000, against yesterday's official 27,015 with shipments of 7,714. There were left over from yesterday about 14,000. 

The cattle market was rather dull; receipts 7,500 head. The receipts of hogs for this week, barring "blizzards," are estimated at 120,000 to 130,000. The stock of lard on hand at Chicago is estimated at 97,000 to 98,000 tierces. The movement of provisions during last week included about 60,000 pieces of sides and shoulders to the South.

**Local Provisions**  
There was no change in local provisions, but the feeling was not so steady. A moderate jobbing business was done in pork and lard at about quotations. 

**Canada Short Cut**  
Bran: $1.25-$1.30  
Mess pork, western, brl: $15.00-$15.76  
Short-cut western, brl: $10.00-$10.00  
Thin mess pork, brl: $6.00-$6.00  
Mess beef: $8.00-$8.00  
Indian mess beef: $10.00-$10.00  

The hog market was quiet and unchanged at $6.00.

**OUR WINNIPEG DESPATCH**  
**THE SITUATION OF CARLTON**  
A MAIL CARRIER'S REPORT  

Winnipko, March 26. Nothing startling was received from the seat of the rebellion in the Northwest today. A rumor in circulation at a late hour last night that the rebels were following up their success of the first fight and had attacked the police, under Col. Irvine and Major Crozler at Fort Carlton, with additional loss of life, including the death of Major Crozler, happily turns out to be not true. It is now believed that Colonel Irvine, who is in command at the post with one hundred and seventy police and two hundred Stony Indians, will keep the rebels at bay, unless they are reinforced by an Indian rising, of which there is thought to be some fear. Chief Heardy might be aroused to sympathy with Kiel, but the number of bucks on his reserve will not exceed eighty men. 

Archbishop Tache expresses indignation at being suspected of giving countenance to the insurrection. He says he got Kiel out of one scrape, but now that he has gotten into another, he must take the odium of it and suffer as he deserves for his indiscretion. The movement has no sympathy from the Roman Catholic Church. Kiel's mother and brothers reside at St. Vital, a short distance south of Winnipeg, but with the exception of his mother, none of them know anything of his movements. 

The half-breed settlement extends twenty-six miles from Dumont's crossing to Prince Albert. From Batoche crossing to Carlton is 17 miles, passing through Duck Lake. St. Laurent is the name applied to the half-breed settlement referred to. There is a Catholic church four miles down the river and one at Duck Lake. Kiel is understood to have made his headquarters at Batoche crossing. He is thought to be the leader, as he was a captain in the buffalo hunts for many years and is known as a bold and energetic man. He was in the habit of going buffalo hunting across the line and had many encounters with the Sarcee, Pigeon, and Blood Indians on the American side. It is estimated that there are at least one thousand male adults among the half-breeds in that section. They raise cattle, farm a little, and are described as being generally in good condition.

The Winnipeg troops, except the field battery, have all arrived at Qu'Appelle and are pushing forward to Fort Qu'Appelle, from whence the advance will be made on Fort Carlton on Monday. The distance across the plains is two hundred miles. Qu'Appelle is 325 miles from Winnipeg by rail. The field battery embarked this morning with fifty men and two cannons. Two other guns followed later. Captain Stewart is to enroll two hundred cowboys from the ranches at the Rockies, who will, it is said, act as scouts for the expedition across the plains. Lieut.-Governor Dewdney and Col. Herchlmor are back to Qu'Appelle from Regina to forward arrangements. Seventy-five teams have been engaged for the transport of troops and material. A number of citizens will accompany the troops. The men are greatly excited over the news from Duck Lake and are anxious for an advance.

**Sunday's despatch**  
Winnipko, Man., March 29. Fort Carlton is reported to have been burned, said to be accidentally but believed by military critics to have been done by Col. Irvine as a military strategem to prevent it from falling into the hands of the rebels, who thereby might secure additional stores, supplies, and arms. It has been ascertained that there are not probably over five hundred armed men among the insurgents, although, could arms and ammunition be procured, probably three times that number could be placed in the field. The half-breeds are determined and seem resolved, now that blood has been shed, to fight, as they expect no indulgence will be shown them by the authorities. If the news from Col. Irvine is at all favorable, it is believed Gen. Middleton will move forward with the troops now under his command and not await the arrival of the troops now on the way from the east. Col. Strange, who raised a hundred men at Calgary, has been, it is rumored, ordered to report with his men at once to Qu'Appelle to join the troops from Winnipeg, expected to begin the march tomorrow to Prince Albert to assist the mounted police. Telegraphic communication is still interrupted between Clark's crossing on the main government line and Prince Albert. Messengers sent from Battleford to Fort Carlton have returned, being unable to force a way through the rebels, who seem to have intent on the whole country around the fort. 

A second battalion of infantry has been put in commission here, eight companies strong, for service in the city and is under command of Lt.-Col. Osborne Smith, Late Deputy Adjutant-General of this military district. 

**THE BURNING OF CARLTON**  
The report of the burning of Fort Carlton and its evacuation by the mounted police has been confirmed by a despatch received by Commissioner Wrigley of the Hudson's Bay Company, from their chief factor Mr. Clarke. Col. Irvine, with 260 police and volunteers, left the post on Friday, the 27th, after burning the stores and other supplies likely to fall into the hands of the rebels. Its evacuation was rendered necessary from the lack of provisions to supply the increased force and the exposed character of the post in the event of an attack by the rebels from the surrounding hills. They have gone to Prince Albert, it being easier to defend and the larger settlement requiring protection. The only means of news now from Prince Albert will be by courier to Battleford, a distance of 120 miles, and then... Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

by telegraph to Winnipeg. The following additional particulars have been received of THE FIGHT AT DOCK LAKE. Firing was begun by the rebels while Major Crozier was holding a parley with Riel under a flag of truce. The engagement then was broken, the police and volunteers having responded with a vigorous fire. The rebels reported to have lost forty-seven men killed and wounded. The valor of the mounted police rendered effective service in covering the retreat to Fort Carlton, and but for them almost inevitable disaster would have followed. A rebel emissary who has been traveling around amongst the reserves on the Saskatchewan inciting to a rising was caught. News has just been received of Crees at Poundmaker. Poundmaker, a delegation was arrested at Fort Till. News resolved of an outrage at maker's reserve, and that of the way to Battleford to make a demand upon the authorities. This matter is explained by our Ottawa correspondent, Ed. Gazette. Capt. Norman of the mounted police here approves of the action of Col. Irvine and thinks it a strategic move and that it will embarrass the rebels. It would also relieve the anxiety of the settlers at Prince Albert, one of the most populous districts in the Northwest on the Saskatchewan. The report is current that Captain Moore died from the effects of the fight of Thursday, but it still lacks confirmation.

FORT CARLTON is in a hollow on the south bank of the North Saskatchewan. The only building in the place is the fort and a house to the east of the fort, about fifty yards, occupied by Hon. Lawrence Clarke. There are no residents in the place save the mounted police and Hudson's Bay officials. The fort lies about fifty yards from the river, a flat bluff rising behind it to a height of 200 feet above the level of the river. The Indian reserve here is in charge of Farm Instructor Chaffey, but it is believed Indians will accompany the police to Prince Albert, moving along the north bank of the river, and that they will be free from annoyance by the rebels. The mail service has been interrupted via Duck Lake and Prince Albert. The last mail is now detained at Humboldt and will probably reach its destination along with the military, now about to move from Fort Qu'Appelle. It is supposed the lost mail from Edmonton, Battleford, and Prince Albert escaped by a line of the mail carrier, who, upon arriving at Duck Lake, saw crowds of half-breed women assembled and excited. He soon learned that they were on the warpath, waiting to intercept the mails at the junction of the Prince Albert and Fort Carlton trails, not far from Humboldt. He returned to Prince Albert and resolved to proceed by the Carrot River settlement to Humboldt, the mail reaching Winnipeg in safety by rail on Friday night. Inspector McLeod has now resolved to send the Battleford and Edmonton mails by rail to Swift Current, thence by courier to their destination. All Hudson's Bay supplies and government stores being freighted to the Northwest from Qu'Appelle have been seized by the rebels at Batoche Crossing. Freight since sent is at Humboldt awaiting military assistance before moving to its destination. A special train with the second detachment of troops from Winnipeg reached Qu'Appelle yesterday and occupy comfortable quarters in the immigrant buildings vacated by the first detachment who are at Fort Qu'Appelle, 18 miles further north. The excitement here is intense, and the ordinary quietude of the Sabbath is disturbed with crowds hanging around the bulletin boards of the newspaper offices and eagerly buying up the Sunday editions, which were issued throughout the day. The insurrection was referred to in the pulpits in many churches today and prayers offered for the success of the troops. A blizzard is said to be raging in Qu'Appelle Valley today and may delay the prompt transport of troops from Qu'Appelle. Governor Dewdney and Chief Factor McDonald of the Hudson's Bay Co there have had another conference with Piapot and other chiefs, and have been again assured that they would remain loyal to their great white mother. Word has just been received that Milliard Mitchell, postmaster at Siobart, near Duck Lake, is a prisoner in the hands of the rebels. The people of Medicine Hat held a large meeting yesterday in the immigration shed and resolved to form a volunteer corps for home protection. About one hundred men enrolled themselves and appointed the following officers: Thomas Tweed, captain; Wm Anderson and Dr. Burchell, lieutenants. The government has been telegraphed for arms and ammunition. Scouts are being employed to watch the movements of half-breeds to the north to prevent a surprise. Should they make a descent upon Medicine Hat they will receive a warm reception. The Canadian Pacific Railway authorities have resolved to organize a regiment after the style of the old Grand Trunk Rifle Brigade to operate all along the line for the protection of the property of the company. Capt. Gauthier of the purchasing department, well known in connection with the volunteer service, has been entrusted with the organization of the corps. Students of the colleges under Manitoba University are enrolling to be ready for either home or active service as emergency may demand. The field battery which left here yesterday arrived at Qu'Appelle today and are being got in readiness to advance at once with the Rifles to Prince Albert. Col. Scott, A.L.P., is expected to arrive from Ottawa to raise another regiment here for the front. He has telegraphed ahead to the old officers of the former Red River expedition to recruit the companies and to get as many men of the old corps together as possible. This will give a regiment of veterans who will have a second chase after Riel. A special train with arms, ammunition, and supplies for the eastern troops is expected here tonight.

1885-04-27: NIKE CAMP (CAMP L'UNION) (ON THE FIELD), 1 Mile North, 1885. Since my last letter, dated Fort Qu'Appelle and Touchwood, the trains have made excellent progress, and we are now encamped on a beautiful slope overlooking the two side log cabins which enclose all that locality, known in the town or village, or whatever else it may be called, of 1 1 n m I t t. The routes of the 1 1 that 'T' through which have passed are deserted and forlorn, an empty habitation with nothing: the name indicated on the map. To the back of the army these have been great disillusionments, as they have trudged from point to point with the hope of adding a few luxuries to their exceptionally hard fare by having up any of the trading stores which they had expected to encounter. Fort Qu'Appelle, much the same, has been the only place of importance through which the troops on this division have passed. Touchwood, on the northern limit of the hills known under the same name, consists of merely a Hudson Bay post of only one building. The next structure met with was a low shed in the middle of the Salt Plains, a large tract of country forty miles in width, extending northward from the Touchwood hills on the road to Humboldt. This building is used as a halfway house or stopping place for the mail carrier and stage conveyance. I do not know exactly how to convey in words to your readers the really creditable work of the troops now in the field during the past week. First, it must be remembered that it was widely asserted and assented to by the majority of those supposed to be well-informed on the subject in Winnipeg, that from Qu'Appelle troops could not possibly reach Clarke's Crossing on the South Saskatchewan in less than six weeks. On Monday last, the 6th instant, the General commanding ordered the advance from Fort Qu'Appelle. The force then consisted of the first battalion, Winnipeg Rifles, 300 strong, the Winnipeg Field Battery, two guns and 60 men, scouts, and about 20 Winnipeg sharpshooters. Along with this force were taken ammunition and supplies for thirty days in wagons. The line of march, along the prairie trail, of this comparatively small force extended nearly three miles in length. The troops were all required to march on foot and they have, every day for a week now, been on the march. The roads for heavy marching have been something terrible, and the sufferings of the volunteers have been immense and cannot be readily conceived. The first day's march, on Monday, 6th inst., was short, being only nine miles. The start, however, was made late in the day. Camp was pitched that night on a wild, bleak country, low and wet as a sponge. An hour after, a severe windstorm and a heavy snow blizzard from the north set in and continued all night. The cold was so intense that a few of the men suffered any such. The next day's march was a surprise to the physical extremities of the corps, being nineteen miles, through frozen water eighteen inches deep and over a frozen road, which for wagon ruts would put to shame many of the roughest of corduroy roads to be met with in the thick townships of an Ontario constituency. Although personally, as a correspondent, I enjoyed whatever comforts and privileges the expedition afforded, yet I could sympathize with the sufferings of the men of the 90th battalion, many of whom are personal acquaintances of mine in Winnipeg. The 90th, to a great extent, is composed of young business men, either in commercial or financial pursuits of their own, or employed in banks, law offices, railway and government offices, besides a great many of the respectable tradesmen and mechanics of the city. They have been accustomed to no such work in their lives as that which they have lately performed, and even those who have seen their hardest days either homesteading or surveying for the Dominion have never done so much hard work in their career on such miserable and inadequate food. Of the fare, I shall say something later on in this letter. The boys of this corps, however, set out with a determination to go through everything and show the people what they can do. This is partly prompted on account of the "COLD SEND OFF" they received from the citizens of Winnipeg when marching from their headquarters to the station for embarkation. This send-off might be accounted for from the fact that there was at that time very little excitement over and very little importance attached to the rebellion in the west, and when the troops marched out of Winnipeg the people fully expected to see them march back again in a few hours. Nevertheless, the boys feel aggrieved all the same, and hope to make as good a name for themselves as possible as a sort of retaliation. After the second day's march, the blisters on the feet were so numerous and the stillness of the limbs so great that they began to feel that a halt would be appreciated. A battery from Quebec being a day's march behind the general ordered a halt on Wednesday in order to rest the force and allow the battery to catch up. During the previous week's delay for supplies at Troy and Fort Qu'Appelle the troops had been constantly under drill, and had improved so much in their steadiness and drill that on the inspection by Gen. Middleton on the day of the halt he was so pleased that he caused the following brigade order to be published to the troops: "The major-general commanding has been pleased to express his great satisfaction with the alertness and steadiness of the 90th when inspected by him this morning, and with the manner in which the regiment has performed the arduous duties devolving upon it since called out for active service." (Signed) "M. Person, Lt.-Col. Chief of the Staff." On the next succeeding days, from Thursday the 8th instant to last evening the 13th instant, the troops were rushed forward without a rest, leaving at 6 a.m. each day and marching until 5 p.m. The distance covered each day was on average 22 miles. To bank clerks and law students, twenty-two miles day after day in succession in heavy order is no small feat. The country passed over was full of sloughs of water, interspersed with small creeks three feet deep. Through this water the force plunged, in their short laced boots and leggings, and for the next few yards the freezing sound of water in the legs of the men's boots told of additional blisters to appear that night. When I speak of the incidents I will it to be understood that there has not been a single complaint. Here is the corrected text:

**hIoIiR (hi llliu, The Wen sen lint niHVlly and they do their work and duly will I llm leant licul till Ion** 

To add to the discomfort of the day's march, the men have the labor of pitching their tents and the guard and police duty each night. The work of a volunteer here just at present may be laid down as follows: Home at 5 a.m., rise, take a hurried breakfast of a cup of tea and a "hard-tack," strike tent and march at 6 a.m., all done within the space of an hour. The march during the day is continuous with the exception of a short halt at noon for something to eat and rest. The halt for the night is generally made at 6 p.m.; tents are pitched, supper prepared, and the first two hours are all taken up in drying socks and clothing over the camp fires. The nights are very cold, the ground is wet, and in spite of all the drying efforts of the men, their hands in the morning are generally frozen stiff, and they are thus obliged to tramp ahead. Instruments of toil are until the warmth of the sun and the water in the surroundings have again made them pliable. 

In addition to the day's heavy marching, a certain number of the men are detailed off to act as an outlying picket. This necessitates additional tramping throughout the night, and at present the picket comprises almost a fourth of the force each night. On Friday night last the force reached Touchwood, and on Saturday morning the great Pall Plains lay before us. This region, nearly 15 miles in width, is a veritable desert, and crossing it during the present warm weather caused a decided depression in the morale of the men. For the whole distance, there was not a stick of wood, and nothing but alkali water to drink. Brigade orders were issued, leading old-timers to avoid consuming any of the water. 

The halt Saturday night in the middle of these plains was a disagreeable experience. Lime juice tea was issued to the men that night, and the fires, owing to the small supply of wood the ox wagons were able to bring in, were very meager. The next day, Sunday, tired as the men were, they gladly prepared for the regular all-day march, in order to get out of such a homeless region. With the endurance and willingness of the men in these heavy marches, to which they were evidently unaccustomed, the general was so well pleased that he caused another complimentary order to be issued to the following effect: "The major general has seen with much pleasure, the willing manner in which the troops under his command have performed the long and wearisome marches which have been required of them, and he feels sure that should the troops become aware that the presence of women and children depends upon their efforts, he may in the future fully rely on their exerting themselves to the utmost." 

It is an oft-repeated saying here that the army in the field never hears anything of the news, even in their vicinity, such is the strict and cautious discipline regarding the suppression of the publication of the news in the camp. But the reports of several small skirmishes in the north and the massacre at Frog Creek had just been passed around, and the allusion in the orders to the rescue of the prisoners made the boys determined to do their best cheerfully. Thus, with the exception of the day's halt referred to, the march from Appell to Humboldt, H! miles, has been covered in just one week, or about a fifth of the time currently prophesied in Winnipeg before the departure of the troops, and we are now just two days' march from Clarke's Crossing in the South Saskatchewan. The average rate per day has been about twenty miles. 

This is decidedly big work. "Otter's Guide," the Canadian authority, I believe, on most military matters, says that troops when not on forced marches, should begin with six miles a day and then work it up to thirteen miles a day, and the latter distance should not be exceeded if possible. Otter's estimate is evidently child's play, and the rate performed here means business. I may say that the general says we have not begun to do any forced marches as yet. The boys who are halted at this point for a day are particularly cheerful under the influence of a warm, sunshiny day and beautiful scenery. The band of the 90th accompanying the force is playing lively airs and camp songs to make all cheerful and gay. 

Two days ago, half of the Toronto School Infantry joined us, forty strong, and we are now waiting for the 10th Royal Grenadiers of Toronto, who will possibly join us tomorrow. The march will then again be resumed. Of course, nothing definite is known outside as to the whereabouts of the enemy, further than an engagement may possibly take place the day after tomorrow (Thursday). A few of the mounted police who rode back to meet us report Kiel and his force about forty miles to the northwest of us. The consequences of an engagement will no doubt be severe. The fighting will be what might be called bush fighting. It is hardly possible that Kiel's force will meet us in any organized shape. Were they to do so, they would, without hardly a doubt, be dispersed in a very few minutes by a few shrapnel shells from the field guns. Were they to attempt to throw up any fortifications, the shells again would be very much in our favor. But it is generally thought throughout the camp, that the enemy will be scattered individually in the bush all over the country. To fight a body of men so scattered means a pretty serious business. 

If our force charges in any one particular place, the benefit derived would be the possible killing of one or two of the enemy while the bullets, no doubt, would be pouring in from many hundreds of different directions. The troops here do not expect to handle the enemy in a hand-to-hand conflict. The tactics pursued by the general will be to keep in the clear country as much as possible and advance all the time, and thus to draw out the enemy from the bush. The presence of "A" Battery lends a great amount of confidence, and the force hopes that the engagement will be such as to enable the artillery to work to advantage. 

Although there is every chance of an early engagement, there is nothing which the soldiers in this camp think less about than the coming fight. The heavy marches, their hunger, and the poor food supplied to them occupy their attention to such an extent that they neither find the time nor the inclination now to think about any engagement which might soon arise. I remember well Colonel Burnaby's description of his cold drive across the snows of Russia on his way to Khiva, where he describes that all he and his followers could possibly think of was what they could get to eat at the different posts. Here there has been some great mistake made in the matter of the men's food. The food issued is simply tea and hardtack and canned beef. So far, on two occasions, I believe there was a slight change, when some fresh beef and a little pork were issued. But in the main, canned beef, hard biscuit, and tea have been the sole fare. 

The men, unused as they are to the fare, would not perhaps grumble so much if a sufficient ration or allowance was issued to them. For instance, during the first three days' heavy marching when the men felt the necessity for good nourishing food, all that was issued to them was three "hard tack" biscuits each a day, which had to do for three meals, or one biscuit a meal. The government ration is a pound and a half or ten biscuits a day. The men also complained at so much canned beef being given to them instead of pork. The canned beef, the manufacture of a Chicago firm, has a peculiar flavor. It is dry and seems to contain very little nourishment. At least the men tire of it to such an extent that they cannot eat sufficient to give them any great staying power. 

I have heard that the food of the men has been quite a howl over the matter in the Winnipeg press. That they do not wish for any exceptional favor. They require no luxuries, but they modestly ask for what they are no doubt entitled to, that is the government rations, including pork and beans. As it is just now, they complain bitterly of the canned beef and hardtack being their only food. The commissariat in the department controlling the matter should remember that the men in the field are nearly all volunteers, and not regulars. They are for the most part gentlemen, who have left most lucrative positions in the city. They have thrown up their business pursuits at almost an hour's notice, and have voluntarily entered the field for their country's cause in suppressing the rebellion, and they should be treated to some extent, if not liberally, at least fairly. 

These volunteers are making sacrifices patriotically to an extent that can hardly be realized. Of the north, two-thirds of the corps went either making or holding positions worth to them from two to fifteen dollars a day. A great many of them had businesses of their own which they at once closed up. A number of them, small tradesmen and storekeepers, with whom I have some acquaintance, turned the key in their shop doors and came on with the boys. The officers are a great many of them lending bits of business, whose interests will suffer to a considerable extent. When the rebellion commenced, they went eager to go to the front. They felt it was the chance of a lifetime to see active service, for Canada does not indulge in many campaigns, and this promises to be the most serious military affair that Canada has yet had to deal with. So all who had the fortune to belong to the corps were glad of the opportunity to take a hand in. 

When doing so, however, they had no idea of how serious the matter was, nor of the great length of time they might be called upon to endure. I venture to say that to the majority of the young men at present engaged in this campaign, the cost individually will range from three hundred to a thousand dollars. Many of the young lawyers' and tradesmen's businesses will have to be built up again. In consideration of the sacrifices made, a private's pay of fifty cents is but a poor remuneration, and by that volunteer, it is accepted as being merely nominal. When he came out here, the private did not come to expect a preliminary reward. He knew full well that there was no money to be made in the business. The sacrifices, though no doubt hard to bear, were accepted with a sort of trusting willingness. It was duty's call and the interests of the country in the main, besides a certain amount of chivalry inherent to a more or less extent in most of mankind which no doubt prompted them to rush to the "tented field." 

But in doing so, even the small pay of fifty cents should be left intact. In a case of this kind, the volunteer should not even be called upon to furnish his own boots and socks. If the roads and the weather were ordinarily favorable, the matter would not be so important. But during the present season, the volunteer has found it necessary to draw extra boots from stores every few days, his other pairs having become so stiffened and frozen in the early morning that it is almost impossible to get them on. The hurried marches, the picket work at night, and the tired spirits of the men do not permit them to devote any time to the work of drying boots and socks over the campfires. These extra boots have been charged to the account of the men, and, in fact, almost all the necessaries actually required as necessaries are charged up. 

On active service, under such circumstances, if anyone is entitled to reward, it is the Canadian volunteers and the Winnipeg corps, who have so nobly sprung to their posts when called upon. No doubt a great many of the papers will make what political capital they can out of the treatment of the men. But, after careful observation, I cannot see what political capital can be made. There is no doubt that...

Under the hurried circumstances, the best that this silly could be done has been done. The men feel that many things have been accidentally overlooked, and consequently have not indulged in any petty grumbling, but have accepted the discomforts of the campaign as cheerfully as possible. On the boot question, the government, no doubt, will assume the cost. The men, while they have not claimed anything more than they feel they have a right to, expect to be treated squarely on that point. In time of peace, the volunteer provides his own footwear, as he properly should, but during active service, now going on, the boots are worn out in the interests of the country, and if the footwear amounts to more than the whole of the private's pay, he should not be called upon to put his hand in his own pocket to meet the difference. There has been quite a great deal said as to the advisability of issuing a daily ration of liquor to the men. The General has adopted Wolseley's plan, I understand, and discountenances such a course. There is probably a great deal of truth in the fact that if a man grows accustomed to take a daily ration of half a gill of liquor each day, he would, after the campaign, become or likely to become a confirmed "ration drinker." But while a daily ration would not probably be well, I believe that after a long twenty-four miles march through mud and half-frozen water, to a dreary camping ground, with a snowstorm looming up from a forbidding array of windy clouds in the southwest, that little of something strong would go "to the right place." There are men in the camp who have been strictly temperate for years, who feel that such a ration under the circumstances described might well be called a necessity. No one can be capable of judging on this question, unless put through a similar day's hardship during cold weather to see how he would feel on the matter. One thing is certain, and that is a daily ration of grog is not at all necessary, although it stands open how much life and spirit an occasional "horn" would throw into the tired spirits of the men. I might say here that so far the men of the volunteer corps have done the same work, and endured the hardships equally as well as the regulars, namely, A Battery and the Toronto School of Infantry. This may be somewhat of a surprise to many who are fond of running down the qualities of the Canadian militia, but the conduct and the work of the militia here in the field have been eminently satisfactory to the Major-General and Lord Melgund. In fact, the general has on several occasions expressed his surprise at the manner in which the 90th has performed its arduous work. The general is already, to a certain extent, popular with the boys. At the camp fires, he readily joins in the choruses to their songs, and has even unbent sufficiently to dance to several Irish airs played one evening by the band. The boys like him better for it too, although they meet his keen-eyed glance with some trepidation when on inspection or parade.

1885-06-10: E. Skillings, of Bethel, Me., president of the Winchester club, passed through the city a day or two ago, on his return home. He reports an excellent week's sport. The London Times of May 25 says: "The Canadian game of lacrosse is becoming very popular in this country. On Saturday at Belfast, the fifth contest between England and Ireland was decided. During the earlier portion of the game, the home team scored two goals through the agency of Ross and Sinclair. Afterwards, Sinclair obtained two more, while McWha and Weatherup each secured one. England did not score, and thus Ireland was victorious by six goals to none." The baseballist is a wit, as witness the following: The baseball umpire is occasionally obliged to make a home run after the game is over. "Atlanta Constitution: It is thought a special law will be passed in all the States to allow baseball umpires to carry arms and wear sheet-iron armor." Oil City Blizzard: "I wish I was captain of a baseball nine," pensively remarked a sad-eyed mule. "And why?" asked an astonished donkey. "So's I'd get a chance to kick. A mule don't have half a show anymore."

1885-08-19: SHEEP FARMING IN THE NORTHWEST A Rapidly Growing and Promising Industry. Mr. John Hallam has been giving his opinions on sheep farming in the Northwest to a Globe reporter as to the district of sheep raising on the ranches. He says: "The common breed is the Montana, a sheep with a good deal of Merino blood. It is a hardy, active animal, with close wool. On the Cochran ranches, they have one hundred imported Shropshire bucks, which they intend to cross with the Montana ewes. As the sheep-ranching business is a new thing in this district, I can speak only of what is probable; but I think that crossing a full-bred Merino with the Montana once would produce a sheep well adapted to the country. Crossing the Montana with a distinct Merino breed would not, I think, produce an animal that would thrive so well, and I know the wool would not be so good. The grasses of the prairie supply the flocks with everything they require. A portion of the grass is reserved for hay, and this is fed to the sheep during a very small portion of the winter when they are unable to earn their own living. The grasses will grow so long as the soil is kept intact and not turned over. "Spear grass," of course, interferes somewhat with the comfort of the sheep. The tops break off and work into the flesh of the animal, especially the neck. Then a ball is formed and the bit of grass is discharged. But the grass grows only in certain parts of the country, and it is not regarded as a serious evil. So sheds must be built to provide shelter during blizzards and severe storms, as the sheep cannot be trusted to seek the shelter of a bluff, as horses and cattle do. From all I can learn, there is less risk of losing lambs there than in Ontario. The only danger is from sudden blizzards or rainstorms, and this will diminish as the country becomes settled and better shelter is provided. As to the exportation of mutton and wool, in the first place, sheep can be raised in that country cheaper than in most older places that I know of. The test is a question of distance and cost of transportation. We cannot expect to export wool beyond Canada, as this country is a heavy importer of wool; but, of course, every pound of wool grown will displace a pound of imported wool. The wool from the sheep which I saw is suitable both for flannels and cloths. At present, I can import wool from Australia or the Sandwich Islands cheaper than I can bring it from the Northwest, but I think the freight could be materially reduced so that the Northwest could compete profitably with Australia. The present price of Northwest wool is 17 cents per pound, laid down in Toronto. Shearing is done chiefly by Scotchmen, who have been shepherds in the Old Country. As they are rather scarce, they control the prices pretty well, and the cost of shearing is just now a very serious item. But I think it will decrease." Mr. Hallam says that the industry is rapidly growing, and at present the ranchmen are increasing the size of their flocks. He regards the prospects of the business as excellent.

1885-09-03: L. Robinson (now) 51 Beaver Hall. "Why don't you try Carter's Little Liver Pills? They are a positive cure for sick headache and all the ills produced by disorderly liver. Only one pill a dose." New York, September 2: The weather at Brighton Beach today was bracing and invigorating, though somewhat chilly. There was more than an average attendance. A sad accident occurred in the second race, by which Moran, one of the most promising young jockeys, was instantly killed, and two other jockeys, Garrison and Lane, narrowly escaped the same fate. Thirty-one horses started, although twenty-two owners had applied to have their entries withdrawn, considering the number too great on this track to give their animals a reasonable chance to win. Some of the owners also feared just such an accident as unfortunately occurred from overcrowding of the track. At the half-mile post, Moran, who was riding Miss Daly, and as well as could be made out through the dust, was in third place on the outside, with Joe Howell a little in front, closely followed by Gunson on Blizzard and Lane on Bonnie Lee, when he was suddenly pitched high into the air. A moment later, the two other jockeys were thrown. Moran's neck was broken and death was instantaneous. When the fact of his death became known, many ladies on the grandstand were affected to tears. Moran's remains, by permission of the coroner, were removed to the temporary home of his mother at Sheepshead Bay. Garrison and Lane, who were thrown at the same time as Moran, were not seriously injured. In the third race, another accident occurred, which, in one case, may prove fatal. Rivers, who was riding Wonderment, and Williams on Cardinal McCloskey, were thrown as they entered the home stretch, and Rivers was carried home tonight still unconscious. Williams escaped with a few bruises.

The Smallpox Cases at Fall River: Fall River, Mass., September 2: Sixth Street, where the smallpox cases were discovered, is a short one running from Bedford to Pleasant Street, about three minutes' walk from the City Hall. It is not paved or curbed. Yesterday, the middle of the roadway was a mass of mud and filth, and stagnant water lay in ill-smelling pools at frequent intervals. The buildings are mostly low tenement houses uncomfortably filled with the poorest class, French Canadians predominating. The chairman of the Board of Health went immediately to the house designated, which was a four-story tenement house, and into the tenement mentioned, and, greatly to his surprise and discomfiture, found that he had walked in upon three most violent cases of well-developed confluent smallpox. The family, named Lessier, consisted of the mother and her father and five children. Three of the children were sick. It is said that Mrs. Lessier went to Montreal a short time ago to visit her husband, who was there sick with smallpox. The entire family has been removed to the smallpox hospital and the house quarantined. Great fears exist that the disease has been spread to a frightful extent, although every precaution is being taken.

1885-10-15: THE GAZETTE MONTREAL THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1888. MONTREAL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15. THE HEALTH QUESTION BEFORE THE COURTS. An important victory was gained yesterday when the equality of the action taken by the Provincial Health was sustained by Mr. Justice Taché. A writ of injunction was prayed for against the city by the municipality of Mile End, in order to prevent the use of the Exhibition building for municipal purposes. His Honor had no hesitation in deciding, in the first place, that the municipality of Mile End had shown no interest entitling them to come into court. And he went further and disposed of the main question; that is to say, whether the Federal or the local Legislature has jurisdiction over matters of public health and the enactment of regulations rendered necessary by the presence of disease of a contagious nature. On this point, His Honor set at rest, as far as the decision of a court can settle any question, all doubts which have been entertained as to the legality of the measures taken under the provincial authority. The learned judge holds that the Federal jurisdiction extends merely to quarantine and the establishment and maintenance of marine hospitals, and that the Provincial Legislature has control generally over all matters of public health. The Federal Act of 1885 is therefore...

Constitutional only so far as relates to quarantine, and is without effect insofar as it assumes to legislate on health regulations. In a word, therefore, the authority of the Provincial Board of Health has been sustained, and the uncertainty which existed as to the legality of their action has been happily removed. It may be added that the promptness with which the learned judge has disposed of the question submitted to him is a cause for congratulation in the present emergency. The case involved the examination of several statutes, and was not free from difficulty, yet the decision was given within a few hours after the argument.

**FIGHTING THE DISEASE**  
The civic authorities are now confirmed in possession of the Mount Royal hospitals, and can proceed unhesitatingly in the work of occupation. The number of inmates is increasing with rapidity, and it is satisfactory to learn that the Board of Health has determined upon pursuing strictly the policy of isolation. By no other means can the spread of the disease be so surely checked, and when the board determines to practically quarantine every infected house in which the patient declines removal to the hospital, it will have the support of public opinion. It is gratifying, too, to know that a committee of medical men of high standing has been named to supervise the management of the hospitals, and report upon the same from time to time, it being of great consequence that confidence in the administration of the hospital should exist. Dr. Gardner, formerly house surgeon of the General Hospital, a physician of large experience and excellent reputation, has accepted the position of superintending medical officer of the Protestant wards, a fact calculated to promote confidence in the efficiency of the hospital management. Altogether the work goes bravely on, and promises from this time forward to earn a reward in the gradual disappearance of the epidemic.

**NEWFOUNDLAND POLITICS**  
Our Newfoundland correspondent sends a most interesting account of the state of political parties in that island. The split in the Protestant party, and the threatening of Catholic supremacy, have caused the retirement of Sir William Whiteway, the premier, and the selection of Hon. Robert Thorburn, a prominent merchant of St. John's, as his successor. By this move the Protestant majority is harmonized, but the people at large lose the services at the head of the Government of one of the ablest and most competent statesmen the country has known. The religious quarrel in Newfoundland is evidently deep-rooted and bitter, and in their blind and stupid fanaticism, in their crass intolerance, men fling away opportunities big with benefits for themselves and their country. The experience in the case of the island is by no means singular; even in Canada, indeed in this very city of Montreal, we have learned how intensely men can hate one another for the love of God, but it is a sad commentary on our boasted progress under free institutions and popular government that in a general election the sole consideration of the electors should be the sectarianism of the candidate. Our correspondent pays a high and well-deserved tribute to the late Premier, Sir William Whiteway, and suggests that his appointment to the governorship of the island, rendered vacant by the death of Sir John Glover, would be a fitting recognition of his services to the colony. The appointment would assuredly be an excellent and deserved one, but we must dissent from some of the reasons for which it is urged, as for instance, Sir William's intimate acquaintance with the politics, the wants, the aspirations of the people. A governor requires no qualifications of this kind for the successful discharge of his duties; it is enough that he is intelligent, well-disposed, willing to learn, and anxious to please. The military will look after the uplift of the people. Then it is by no means certain that Sir William Whiteway's long participation in party struggle does not rather unfit him for the office of governor, or more properly speaking, make the acceptability of his appointment somewhat doubtful. These objections, if they may be so called, are made to show that our correspondent is not occupying firm ground in his criticism of the present method of appointing colonial governors, but with him we recognize fitness for the office in the late Premier of the island.

**AN AFRICAN NEGRO REPUBLIC**  
The republic of Liberia, to which the Rev. Moses Aaron Hopkins, of whose remarkable career we recently gave a sketch, has just been appointed United States minister, is one of the most extraordinary philanthropic experiments of the present age. Its name implies the object for which it was established. The idea of testing the capacity of the negro race for self-government had been broached early in the present century by some of the more sanguine of the abolitionists of the time. It was not, however, until after the accession of James Monroe to the presidency that a method was proposed for giving it practical form. In 1827, a body known as the American Colonization Society undertook to procure on the west coast of Africa a piece of territory sufficient for the settlement of, at least, as many freedmen as there were then, or were likely to be for several years in the United States. They succeeded in securing, by arrangement with the native chiefs, about 10,000 square miles in the vicinity of Cape Palmas, between Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. The efforts of Zachary Macaulay in that part of the continent to provide for the moral and material welfare of the blacks may probably have led to its adoption for the purpose of the larger enterprise. It was not until 1821, after President Monroe had entered upon his second term of office, that the colony was formally established. It was only in 1847, during the presidency of Polk, that the settlement was declared an independent republic. Its existence as such was first acknowledged by England and afterwards in succession by the various European powers, but the United States did not follow the example until 1861. In 1873 the population numbered about 720,000, of whom only 19,000 were colored people from America, the remainder consisting of native Africans. The capital, Monrovia, so called after President Monroe, has a population of about 13,000. The Liberians have churches, schools, missions, and all the ordinary machinery of civilization. The constitution is modeled on that of the United States. There is no restriction as to the number of terms (of two years each) for which one person may be elected president. There are four ministers in the Cabinet: Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Attorney-General, and Postmaster-General. According to some authorities, the commerce of the country is nourishing and agriculture is successfully practiced. Sugar, coffee, cotton, maize, wheat, barley, oats, tomatoes, cucumbers, tamarinds, lemons, oranges, guavas, pineapples, and African peaches are among the products, besides many of which they export palm oil, gold dust, ivory, and hides. The revenue is derived chiefly from customs duties. In 1871, the Government contracted a loan of half a million dollars, which was issued in England, but no interest has been paid on it, the republic being actually bankrupt. Accounts differ as to how far Liberia has proved a successful test of the capability of the negro to advance in the path of civilization, unaided by the white man. Some writers maintain that it has disappointed all the hopes of the founders; others, without being enthusiastic over the result, consider it, on the whole, satisfactory. One strange reproach against the community is its permission, or connivance at, slavery so largely prevalent among the aborigines of Africa. It is generally conceded that the insertion in the constitution of a clause refusing citizenship to any white person has been a fatal mistake. Those who are most intimately acquainted with the Southern negro are convinced that, deprived of white guidance and example, he is sure to sink in the scale of civilization. In Haiti, vast numbers of the natives have relapsed into barbarism and paganism. In an article in the June Century, from which we have already quoted, Bishop Dudley, of Kentucky, says that "the separation of the negro race from the white means for the negro continued and increasing degradation and decay." The experiment of Liberia, therefore, can hardly be regarded as offering any solution of the negro question in the South. Nevertheless, the fact that a Christian and, at least, as to institutions and habits, a civilized negro state, whose independence is recognized by all the great nations of the world, exists in western and tropical Africa, is not without significance and surely contains some seeds of hope. There is a large amount of American silver currency in circulation in Western Ontario, where it is taken freely at its face value. The Chatham Planet, having in memory the inconvenience and expense the country was put to to get rid of the same nuisance some fifteen years ago, warns the people not to encourage the use of these inferior coins, else someday they will find themselves with a lot of it on their hands, which they will have to submit to heavy discount to get rid of. Chatham has taken steps in the matter already, and will likely continue to implement measures to enforce a heavy discount on all they receive. The Paris correspondent of the London Times, writing of the prevailing conditions of trade in France, adduces the recent railway returns as affording striking proof of it. To the 29th of last month, the receipts of the Northern railway show a decrease of 4,131,000 francs, or about 28 percent, on last year's return, which itself showed a decrease as compared with the figures for previous years. The Lyon railway has to meet a decrease of 1,449,000 francs, or nearly 9 percent; the Southern one of 2,140,000 francs, or 1 percent; the Eastern one of 5,131,000 francs, or 6 percent; the Orleans one of 1,500,000 francs, or 2 percent; still the Guienne one of 1,500,000 francs, or 1.5 percent. A considerable sum, it is likely, will have to be paid by the state at the end of the year to make up the guaranteed dividends. It is not easy to see what spilt other than that of "purchasing power" could have resulted. It is clear that the municipalities to the north of the city in their opposition to the establishment of the Mount Royal hospital could not have been fear of infection; the buildings are so isolated that there is no danger to the inhabitants of even the nearest houses, and, judging by the statistics furnished to the authorities, the epidemic is much more virulent within their bounds than in the city proper. The true interests of these municipalities are much more liable to suffer from the acts of their own residents, when they permit themselves to be thus led astray, than from anything Montreal will do, and the bill of costs they will be saddled with in connection with these legal proceedings may have the effect of impressing this on the mind of the ratepayer. In pointing out the risks that arise from the maritime traffic in animals, Prof. Kream, in his paper read before the British Association on "The Agricultural Situation," pays a high compliment to the system of perfection adopted in Canada. "A method of livestock quarantine," he says, "approaching in its stringency and perfection the admirable system which the Canadians have established at Quebec, is imperatively necessary before our breeders and stock farmers can feel in any degree safe from the disastrous outbreaks among their flocks and herds of the contagious diseases which have in recent years deprived our farmers of so much of their wealth. The maritime traffic in living animals is quite different in its character and its risks from the trade in any other kind of produce, whether agricultural, mineral, or manufactured; it demands special precautions and no irrelevant issue as to free trade versus protection should be allowed to stand in the way of establishing such precautions." In his account of a visit which he paid to Greece last year, Prof. Mahaffy writes, "Greece is a growing country, both in its youth and in its age. The rapid development of the nation is altering the face of the country, establishing new roads and better communications, improving knowledge among the people, and making many places accessible which were before beyond the reach of brief holiday visits. The insecurity which haunted the Turkish frontier has been pushed back to the north; new Alps and new monasteries are brought within the range of Greece. And this is nothing to what has been done in recovering the... Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

Each year there are new excavations made, new treasures found, new problems in archaeology raised, old ones solved; and so at every visit there is a whole mass of new matter for the student who feels he has not yet grasped what was already there. Athens is rapidly becoming a great and rich city. "Lieut. Weissmann, whom a telegram received last week represents as having defeated the cannibals and ferocious Ahiamzous of the Congo, is one of the number of German explorers and savants to whom Stanley gives high praise in his latest work. In referring to Prince Bismarck's policy, he instances the ability which he displayed both in sanctioning enterprises of exploration and colonization in Africa, and in selecting fit persons to conduct them. German savants," he says, "had explored territories unclaimed by any power; German merchants were honestly established at certain places on the West African coast; out of the most intelligent and enterprising of the sons of Germany, twenty-four geographical societies had been formed, and a dozen colonial associations, besides African societies, were being constituted in Germany. Already Bastian, Gussfeldt, Peschuel, Loesche, Buchner, Von Mechow, Pogge, and Weissmann had been equipped by a German-African society, and it was preparing to dispatch more." Lieut. Weissmann and Dr. Pogge had sent in a most encouraging report regarding the portion of territory which formed the scene of their researches, which they described as densely peopled, some of the villages being miles in length, with clean, commodious houses, shaded by oil palms and bananas, and surrounded by carefully divided fields, in which the men attended to the cultivation of the soil, while the women confined themselves to their household duties. The tribes to which the telegram relates are of a very different character from those almost civilized communities, so highly commended by the explorers. The Minister of the Interior has been having a somewhat unpleasant experience in his overland trip to Prince Albert. From a letter dated Yorkton, October 4th, it is learned that he left Crescent, about twenty miles from Yorkton, on the previous afternoon, and was getting on splendidly when darkness set in. The prairie fires had made the whole country black, and the party lost the trail. Getting branches with which to make torches, a couple of hours were spent in looking for it, and then the search was given up as unavailing. Unhitching the horses and spreading the buffalo robes, the party lay down to await daylight, supperless and weary. About 10 o'clock a snowstorm came on, a regular blizzard, which continued all night, and by daylight the prairie was covered with four or five inches of snow. It was a long night for them, and when daylight came the search found them in a direct line about a mile from their destination and some two or three miles distant by the road. It was found, however, that there was a most dangerous cold across the river to make, and looking at it as they parted, the thought came that a more serious mishap than an all-night outing in a prairie blizzard might have occurred. Hon. Mr. White remained at Yorkton on October 4th and 5th, interviewing settlers in the locality. He has been compelled to abandon his purpose of visiting Prince Albert, owing to the lateness of the season and the difficulty of traveling, and cannot get too far north until mid-November. He, therefore, proceeded to Qu'Appelle on Wednesday of last week, and is to reach Regina tomorrow. 

18851126: A SNOW STORM. The Wharves Deserted—Navigation Practically Closed. Yesterday was one of those November days which clearly marks the line between the end of the fall and the commencement of our long and severe, though cheerful, Canadian winter. We had the first real snow of the season, and the downfall, which commenced in the small hours of the morning, continued without cessation until a late hour last night, enfolding the city and surrounding country in its mantle of spotless white. It was a dull day in the city, for the fall of snow was accompanied by a high wind, which produced in exposed places all the disagreeableness of the unrelenting blizzard. Business in some branches of trade noticeably, in the everyday shopping occupation of housekeepers, was at a standstill, and customers in dry goods and grocery stores were few and far between. Walking on the footpaths was an exercise fraught with discomfort, and especially where hearty youths deemed it good fun to make slides; the exercise was positively dangerous. The snowfall registered by the meteorologist at McGill University was 5.1 inches. Sleighs were everywhere in use, and the running was fairly good. The wharves looked lonely and deserted, and the busy scenes of the summer months enacted along the quays were transferred to less wintry climes until navigation opens again. A large number of longshoremen left by train yesterday afternoon, some en route to Portland and others for the seaports in the Southern states. The wharves are deserted by ocean steamers and sailing ships, and the only craft remaining are the batteaux and small schooners which carry on the local traffic. Even these are preparing to get home for winter quarters, and next week no sail will be seen on the St. Lawrence until spring. The sheds belonging to the Dominion and Beaver lines have been entirely removed, and the Allan sheds are the next in order for demolition. A Gazette representative learned from an official of the Harbor Board yesterday that the trade to the port during the past year has been fairly good, but it has made no progress on previous seasons. The total tonnage of the imports and exports exceeded the previous season, but the number of ships was fewer. Altogether it is expected that the income of the port will be about 1 percent less than the period of navigation in 1884. The trains due to arrive last night were detained by the storm, and the United States mail did not arrive until some hours after the usual time.

18860109: Arctic Weather at Winnipeg. Chicago, January 8. The blizzard raging at present throughout Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Dakota, and Minnesota is declared to be of wider extent and more fierce in character than has been known before in years. All the western trains are behind time; many have been snowed in and abandoned, and very little can be learned concerning them or the effects of the storm, owing to the blowing down of telegraph poles and wires. The temperature throughout Dakota is stated to be 20 to 40 below zero, with a wild blizzard blowing. A telegram from Fargo says the thermometer registered below zero at noon. Yesterday was described as the toughest experience that that city had in the way of the boisterous weather. Minneapolis reported a high wind with the thermometer 35 below. A high wind is prevailing at Mason City with the thermometer 20 below. Omaha registered 20 below. Telephonic communication with Omaha has been cut off nearly all day. A telegram from Des Moines says the cold wave continues there with high wind and drifting snow. All the through trains west of there are blocked and the branch roads are snowed under. Three Chicago & Burlington trains are stuck fast in a drift about fifteen miles south of Des Moines. The snowstorm prevailed throughout Illinois all day, but the weather has not been very severe. It is, however, growing colder tonight. A cold wave struck Memphis, Tenn., about daylight today. It has been snowing since 10 last night, and a bleak wind from the northwest prevails. At Kansas City, the mercury reached 15 below zero. Through traffic is entirely suspended on the overland road, though several local trains are kept moving. The wind is still blowing steadily on the plains, rendering any outdoor labor difficult. At Chattanooga, Tenn., six inches of snow fell. At 8 o'clock the temperature was 13 degrees, a fall of 24 degrees in eight hours and it is growing colder rapidly. New Orleans, January 8. Despatches from various points in the sugar belt of Louisiana report colder weather than has ever been felt before and the mercury is still falling.

18860111: The annual meeting of the Fish and Game Protection Club on Saturday was most successful, and in the face of such inclement weather there was a remarkable attendance, proving that the interest in the club is not waning in any degree. This is exactly as it should be, for there is no institution wanted so badly as one of this order. The protection of fish and game in any country is a matter of no little importance, and especially in Canada. That the province of Quebec clubs are really doing their duty is made evident from the material which composes the board of officers for the coming year; there is every reason to believe that the good work of the past will be ably continued in the future. The blizzard of Saturday prevented several local happenings, although it will awaken sporting matters which for the past week or ten days have languished in the snow. The snow will start the tramping across the mountain, and, weather permitting, the Montreal club will hold their annual green (teal) pheasant shoot over the usual course on Wednesday night. This being the first race of the year will draw out a big crowd of the club and its friends. The St. George boys were to have started up to Hanna's along the canal, but had, of course, to put it off. The curling rinks were all going in good order and the Quebec challenge cup competition was divided, as our columns of this day will show.

ELEMENTS ON THE WARPATH. The Arctic Wave Sweeps Over the Continent, ACCOMPANIED BY BAD BLIZZARDS, Reaching as Far South as the Gulf of Mexico, AND DOING TREMENDOUS DAMAGE. Many Vessels Wrecked on the New England Coast, CAUSING GREAT LOSS OF LIFE. Galveston Bay Frozen Over—The Cold Increases in the West. Travel Interrupted. New York, January 10. A furious snowstorm set in here early on Friday night and lasted well into Saturday. About six inches of snow fell and it has drifted badly. Travel is greatly delayed. The temperature is low and high wind prevails. Intelligence from all parts of the country is to the effect that the weather is of the most severe character, the Southern states reporting great damage by the cold wave, while the Northwestern and Central states report great delays to travel of all kinds. At Columbia, S.C.,...

18860112: A HYPERBOREAN EPOCH. The Weather's Cold Wave Gives No Indication of RELAXING ITS GRASP. Great Damage in the West and North. Trains Blocked, Many Persons Frozen to Death and Stock Killed. Chicago, January 11. The temperature has remained below zero, and the night started in clear and cold, with a prospect of lower temperature. Trains are beginning to arrive a little more promptly, particularly from the west, but only two have been able to clear. Many trains have been blocked for the last two days, and the passengers suffered terribly. The farmers say the loss of dead prairie chickens and coveys of frozen quail can be seen near all the farms. They think few wild fowl will survive the blizzard. The snow was not over three inches deep on the level, but the gale drifted it badly. The thermometer ranged from 18 to 23 degrees below zero.

-cut Mono is the worst one Southern Illinois has had for years.

18860123: VINCINC Hallway generally blocked and causing delay. The coldest weather ever known in Marshalltown, Iowa, January 22. A blizzard struck this section at 2 o'clock this morning and everything is snowed in. The thermometer at 0 a.m. was 21 below zero. On the railroads, the cuts are all filled and the snow is packed hard and solid. No trains can reach here for twenty-four or forty-eight hours. 

Davenport, Iowa, January 22. The mercury here is 12 to 15 degrees below zero and it is still falling. The railroads are blockaded worse than at any previous time this winter. No trains on the Illinois Central from here to Sioux City were moving. The snow blizzard and blockade, particularly on the western half of the road beyond Fort Dodge, was the most severe ever experienced. The passenger train which left Sioux City on Thursday evening was caught near Remsen in a drift, 3,000 feet long and 20 feet in depth. Its engines are "dead" and no provisions for those on board the train are obtainable. The thermometer in that portion of the state is 23 to 25 below zero. Along the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul a passenger train and three freights are in the snow near Winona west of McGregor. Two passenger trains are blockaded at Calmar. A negro minstrel company is snowed in near Marcus and are giving performances on the train. The snow has fallen to a considerable depth, but is very light in weight and has drifted easily.

Buffalo, January 22. The thermometer has got down to 12 above zero and is falling rapidly. The wind is blowing forty miles an hour and increasing in velocity.

Sioux City, Iowa, January 22. The mercury here was 24.3 below zero this morning. Trains on nearly all the roads are several hours behind, and the Illinois Central is still blockaded.

Elk Point, Dakota, January 22. Last night came the coldest weather this winter. It snowed all night, with a strong northerly wind, drifting the snow badly. The thermometer this morning was 40 below zero. The storm has now passed and it is clear.

St. Peter, Minnesota, January 22. Another storm has been raging since last night and all the trains on the Winona & St. Peter road have been abandoned. The thermometer is 30 below zero.

Austin, Minnesota, January 22. The worst storm of the season is raging here, commencing early this morning. Travel is entirely cut off by drifting snow and trains are abandoned. The mercury stands at 33 below zero.

Sioux Falls, Dakota, January 22. Last night's blizzard let up today, though the temperature has fallen from zero to 25 below. The snow drifted badly and packed hard. All the roads are blocked.

Fargo, Dakota, January 22. The mercury this morning stood at 33 below zero. There is no wind. Trains were delayed but little by last evening's storm.

St. Paul, Minnesota, January 22. The blizzard, which has been raging since last night, is the worst known among the railroads for years. In every direction, it is very cold and blowing at a terrific rate, filling cuts and in the southern part of the country making it impossible to keep them clear long enough to run trains. Trains on the Southern Minnesota division of the Milwaukee road have been abandoned. It is 57 degrees below zero at St. Vincent. The Burlington and Northern is also badly blocked.

Minneapolis, Minnesota, January 22. For suddenness and severity, the present blizzard has no superior and few rivals within the memory of the oldest inhabitants. At sunrise this morning, the mercury was 33 degrees lower than at 1 o'clock last night, or 23 degrees below zero. At 9 a.m., it reached its minimum, 28 below, and at noon it had returned, under the influence of the sun, to only 22 below, making the extreme for twenty-four hours ending at noon today 3 degrees. The protection afforded by the buildings of the town reduced the sensible force of the blizzard considerably, but a few farmers who fought their way in from the country reported the storm to be one of terrible severity.

Chicago, January 22. Although no snow fell in the vicinity of Chicago today, the drifting of very fine snow was such as to make railroading very hard and to delay trains. The same state of affairs, from dispatches received by the railway mail service, exists in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, and the signal office predicts that tomorrow's mails from the West and Northwest will be from ten to fifteen hours late. The mercury at 11 p.m. was 10 to 12 below zero, and still falling.

18860126: THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. The second order, to name the aldermen to preside at the nomination of candidates for mayor and alderman in the several wards of the city, on the 10th day of February, and to fix the places where such nominations shall be held, was then considered. Aid. Gresier moved, seconded by Aid. Wilson: that the nominations take place in the open air at the places specified by the several aldermen hereinafter. 

FOR MAYOR: 
- Aid. Gresier presiding at the City Hall. 
- Aid. Beausoleil presiding at the Bourse market. 
- Aid. Perrault presiding at the northwest corner of St. Lampron and James street. 
- Aid. Gray presiding at St. Ann's at the corner of St. Maurice street and Chabolllez square. 
- Aid. Holland presiding at St. Antoine at the northwest corner of St. Patrick and Craig streets. 
- Aid. Fairbairn presiding at St. Lawrence at the Central Fire station. 
- Aid. Mount presiding at St. Louis at the Ontario street fire station. 
- Aid. Gauthier presiding at St. James at the Viger cattle market, Craig street. 
- Aid. Mathieu presiding at St. Mary's at the Papineau market. 
- Aid. Jeannotte presiding at Hochelaga at the fire station, Desery street. 

The Mayor having declared it carried, Aid. McShane jumped up and shouted, "No, no!" The Mayor said it was carried. Aid. McShane said there was not a single Irish Catholic among the presiding officers. The Mayor replied, "It is not a question of nationality but of order." Aid. McShane then said, "Then I am to understand that you do not want any Irish Catholics among the presiding officers?" His Worship Mr. McShane, "I won't permit you to say anything of the kind. I won't allow you to make popularity at my expense. I repeat it is not a question of nationality but one of order." Aid. McShane said, "Very well, I will sit down." His Worship said, "You can move a reconsideration if you like." Aid. McShane replied, "No, I won't. I'll let it go. I wanted Aid. Malone or Aid. Farrell appointed, but I'll let it go." Aid. Gresier finally moved that Aid. Malone's name be inserted in place of Aid. Jeannotte's for Hochelaga ward. Carried unanimously. 

Aid. Phelontaine then moved that the 29th order, to abolish the statute labor tax, be taken up, but was defeated on the following vote: Yeas: Aid. Mathieu, Dufresne, Perrault, Phelontaine, Rainville, McShane, Robert, Wilson, Beausoleil, and Jeannotte 10; Nays: Aid. Mount, Stevenson, Malone, Farrell, Fairbairn, Gauthier, Holland, Stroud, Oenerux, Roy, Holland, Dubuc, Gray, Donovan, Hood, and Grenier 18. 

The council. The discussion had already appeared in full in the media. Aid. Gresier then rose to speak, but the Mayor called him to order, as there was a previous motion before the chair. Aid. McShane argued that as the Mayor had himself submitted the letter to the meeting, it was open for discussion, and having argued his point, said that the Botanical Garden situation had submitted the official documents to the council, despite Professor Penhallow's statement to the contrary. The document submitted to the Park commissioners had not been signed by the president and secretary, but by Professor Penhallow, as provisional director, and neither that gentleman nor Hon. Louis Bouchard had submitted it. He boldly stated that they could not be directors according to the constitution. He understood that there were only twelve members in that commission. He was as much in favor of a botanical garden as anybody. Aid. Holland said, "I'm glad to hear it." This started a little squabble and mutual recriminations were the order of the day. When order was restored, Aid. Gresier said that though he wanted a botanic garden, he did not approve of rushing the thing through the council as had been attributed. 

Aid. Gauthier rose to reply, but again the Mayor tried to stop the debate, saying that there was another motion to be read. Aid. Gresier insisted on speaking and said that Aid. Stevenson had grossly insulted Professor Penhallow and Hon. Mr. Bouchard. Aid. Stevenson (excitedly) said, "I won't allow that. I did nothing of the kind." The Mayor said, "I hope, gentlemen, you will drop these personal issues." Aid. Stevenson asked, "Are you referring to me?" His Worship replied, "No." Aid. Stevenson then said, "Then go for the rest as hard as you like." The Mayor took advantage of this opportunity to read the motions made at the last meeting in reference to the matter. Aid. Gresier then went on to blame Aid. Stevenson for his discourteous treatment of the directors of the association. Aid. Stevenson replied, "It's false." The Mayor said, "Stop, I won't allow this to go on." Aid. McShane asked, "Why do you allow them to talk that way when you are so hard on me?" The Mayor replied, "Probably because you can stand more." Aid. Gresier said that Aid. Stevenson had an ill-will towards this association as could easily be seen by his conduct. Indeed he (the speaker) had received information as to the reason for it. Aid. Stevenson demanded the name of his informant and what he said. Aid. Gresier replied, "I am not in a position to give the name." Aid. Stevenson exclaimed, "He's a liar, and I'll have his name." The Mayor called for order. Aid. McShane remarked, "Those Scotchmen are worse than Irishmen." Aid. Stevenson attempted to speak, but the Mayor again called him to order. Aid. Stevenson said, "I have a right to answer the accusation. Won't you allow me to make an explanation?" The Mayor replied, "No." Aid. Stevenson responded, "Then you're not the fair man I took you to be." The Mayor said he could speak, but not in that tone. 

Aid. Holland then moved, seconded by Aid. Grenier, that the rules be suspended to allow Professor Penhallow to make an explanation to the council. Aid. Wilson rose to speak, but the Mayor decided that no discussion could be allowed on that question. Aid. Wilson asked him to read the clause which forbade discussion. While the Mayor was looking for the clause, a series of lively debates was going on in different parts of the room. At one place, Aid. Holland was threatening Aid. Wilson that he would lose his election if he did not support the scheme, and Aid. Wilson was loud in his assertions that he would stand by his opinions whether or not. At another end of the room, Aid. Stevenson was telling Aid. Grenier that he was surprised at him, although he was not surprised at him, pointing in the direction of Aid. Holland. Aid. Grenier made some reply, and Aid. Stevenson said he would force him within two days to give the name of his informant. Equally lively scenes were being enacted in other parts of the room, until Aid. McShane, who had been taking an active part, said to the Mayor, who had been vainly endeavoring to restore peace, "Will the Mayor please keep order?" The Mayor replied, "Aid. McShane, I have tried my best, as you know yourself." Aid. Holland said in order to terminate the dispute he would withdraw his motion. Aid. Wilson objected, saying, "I want the point settled now." The Mayor said he had examined all the references and found nothing that bore on the question. There was no analogy between parliamentary procedure and that of the council. In Parliament, such a motion had to be carried unanimously, and of course, there was no discussion; but in council, it only required a three-quarters vote, and he thought discussion should be allowed. Here is the corrected text:

Aid Koiieut moved an adjournment, which resulted in a tie, twelve voting each way. The Mayor gave his casting vote in favor of the motion, and the meeting then adjourned. NO BLIZZARDS IN CANADA, Mattitow's Opinion on the Weather in That Region, Far Preferable to the Northwestern States or in the Northern Territories. 

Montreal, January 4th, 1896. Two men were seated in the public room of one of the Montreal hotels, conversing about the weather. From their appearance and their language, they were evidently from the far West; one of them, by his twang, was apparently from the Northern States and territories, while the other was just as surely a Canadian. "Been living some pretty bad weather lately around St. Paul?" said the Canadian. "Yes," replied his friend, "the toughest weather ever known in that section of the country. Why, sir, the thermometer went down to 57 below zero, and the blizzards were so bad as to tear everything up. I came away as quickly as I could get; I don't want any more of it. I have had enough! But I suppose you have had it worse up North?" "Not at all. We have had no blizzards in Manitoba or the Northwest Territories. We leave that sort of thing to you fellows. They never trouble us. You see, we are north of the line of blizzards, and we are mighty glad we are." "Well, but you must have had it colder than we had." "(Oh no! We have not had it nearly as cold as that. The thermometer seldom goes below 40, and of course with a clear atmosphere we do not feel that. Our trains are delayed but very little with either snow or blizzards. But I see yours south of the line are cooped up constantly." "Well, that is all right enough to talk, but can you prove it?" "Prove it? Of course I can, but there's no need; why, everyone knows that we never have such weather north of the boundary line as you do south. You Americans seem to think and talk as if our country was a second edition of Siberia, only more so, but I can tell you and the records will prove it, that the weather along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway is never as severe as on the railways in the Northwestern States. Why, only last winter one of the trains on one of your lines was snowed up for two weeks and the passengers were half-starved to death and had to walk along on top of snow twenty-four feet deep, holding themselves up by telegraph wires. We have no such trouble as that, and would not want it. Let me give you a pointer. You are going back to St. Paul? I have been from Winnipeg through that way, and I know what I'm talking about. Now, when you go back, just take the Canadian Pacific Railway from here to Winnipeg, and then go down south from there. I will bet you a dollar even up that you get there quicker and that you have a good time on the road. The Canadian Pacific runs the best sleepers and has the best dining cars on the continent of America, and if you are going from here to St. Paul this week or next during the blizzard season, you take that line and you will never regret it."

There is no end to the funny things that are seen and heard by our teachers in our public schools. Once, a teacher observed a huge blot of ink on a boy's copybook. "What is that?" he demanded. "Sure, I think it's a tear, sir." "A tear? How could a tear be black?" "Sure, I think one of the colored boys dropped it, sir." For the comfort of children who know what it is to be "flustered," this is the laughable reply of a very bright and accomplished young lady teacher who was passing a purely formal examination in physiology: "Where is the alimentary canal?" was demanded. "Really," was the pleasant reply, "I forget whether it is in Indianapolis or Illinois." 

San Francisco Argonaut. To save themselves from starvation, an "Uncle Tom's Cabin" company, while caught in a western blizzard, ate their donkeys. It was a step in the right direction. Now, if the bloodhounds had only eaten the company and then if the dogcatchers had only caught the bloodhounds, the work of retribution would have been complete. 

Graphic. A curious club exists in Paris, whose object is to assist intoxicated persons home late at night. If the patient is able to indicate where he lives, he is escorted to his lodgings; if he is too far gone to give the information, he is conveyed to the headquarters of the club and kept until sober.

VOL CURE FOR BLIZZARDS 

"Yes, I am on my way to Washington," replied a man with a buffalo overcoat and a beaver hat who was held up for an interview at one of the hotels the other day. "It is hinted that you have made an important discovery?" "So I have! I am Captain John White, of Montana, the man who first discovered the birthplace of blizzards, and who invented a cure for them." "Tell me about it!" "Well, I have nothing to conceal in the matter. For five winters past I have been in the Far West watching cold waves or blizzards. Nineteen out of every twenty start on a line drawn from Fort Union, in the northern part of Montana, to Fort Laramie, in Southern Wyoming. There are mountains, rivers, valleys, and plains on that line, and these bring about the conditions required for a radical atmospheric change." "Did you ever see a blizzard born?" "A hundred of them." "What is the operation?" "Well, for instance, one day last winter I was in camp on the Powder River, in Wyoming, directly west of the Black Hills. It was a pleasant sunshiny day, and during the forenoon the wind blew smartly from the Hills. Just about noon, while I was preparing my dinner, a puff of wind from the Laramie Mountains, to the south, hit me. On the plains, a mile to the south of me, and just where two valleys brought these two different winds to a focal point, a cloud of snow was lifted high in the air, and the wind began to circle. In ten minutes the cloud began moving toward me, and the mercury soon went down eleven degrees. The cloud bore to the northeast, struck the north fork of the Big Cheyenne River, and followed it east to Fort Sully, spreading its flank as it went. At Sully it ran down the Missouri to the Iowa State line. Here the wave was a hundred miles long. When it got down to Omaha it was 200 miles. It left the river there and went east, and by the time the center reached Des Moines, one wing was at Minneapolis, due north, and the other at Sedalia, due south. From wing to wing was 500 miles. That wave took in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana, and was kept from Michigan by lake influences, and later on all the Atlantic coast, from Maine to Virginia, was overspread by it. That was only one out of the many I have seen born." "Could it have been stopped?" "Certainly! It was no larger than a barrel when it started." "What is your cure for these cold waves?" "Well, I've been experimenting. You must warm the air as the first step. In that case, you kill the germ and the blizzard falls flat. On this line of the birthplace of blizzards, a distance of 50 miles, base-burner coal stoves should be set about six feet apart. Ten thousand stoves might do it, but the Government might as well add 5,000 more and make a sure thing of it. Each stove would burn, say, nine tons of coal during the winter. One man, as I figure it, could attend to five stoves. As all the stoves would be outdoors, only one length of pipe to a stove would be required. I figure on saving 78,000 joints of stove-pipe. This item alone would pay for most of the coal. Every blizzard costs the country 3,000,000. We have an average of ten per season. I figure that I can stop every one for $100,000 each. This saves the country 20,000,000 per season. The Government puts $20,000,000 in its pocket and hands me the other nine." "And you have an idea that your scheme will be adopted?" "Certainly! The only fear I have is that the Government may want to put plain stoves off on me, while I shall stick for the nickel-plated affairs. There's no use in going into this thing with anything cheap. I shall return in about a week, and as I will then know exactly how much I can save on stove-pipe, I hope you come and see me. This afternoon I shall try and figure on using one leg to a stove, thus saving 30,000 stove-legs. This would pay for the coal for 367 stoves. Don't forget to come and see me."

18860205: NEW YORK IN MISERY

New York, February 4, 1886. The snowstorm which prevailed yesterday continued all night. It is a regular western blizzard, and undoubtedly the worst storm New York has experienced since 1882. The streets are filled with snow and the streetcars are pulled along with great difficulty by double teams. What adds to the difficulties of the situation is the strike upon the Broadway and Seventh Avenue railroads, the Broadway surface railroad, the Sixth Avenue railroad, and the Fourth Avenue railroad. Many business men have been compelled to walk down to their offices. All mails are delayed.

THE WEATHER FOR THIRTY YEARS 

Baltimore, Md., February 4. The snow is seventeen inches deep here, the fall being the heaviest since Washington, February 4. The railroads to the southward have suffered great interruption from the snowstorm. No trains were sent out from Richmond northward yesterday afternoon and last night. 

Lysomir, Va., February 1. Snow falling since Wednesday; is twelve inches deep. All railroad communication is interrupted. Reports from the southwest portion of the state indicate an unparalleled snowstorm, and here the snow is from two to three feet deep.

18860206: FROZEN TO DEATH

Lincoln, Neb., February 5. Advices from Geneva state that the bodies of a man and woman and six children were found frozen stiff on the prairie near Oberlin, Kansas, yesterday. They are supposed to be a man named Lemmen and his family who started in an emigrant wagon for Oberlin just before the recent blizzard and have not been heard from since.

The aggregate stock of grain continues to increase during the week, bus increased 43,000 bushels, chiefly wheat, and peas. Compared with a year ago, the stocks are larger by 337,000 bushels. The market today showed the customary quietness. Wheat was dull and inactive. Peas have not been dealt in here, which makes it difficult to give quotations. Along the line, however, there has been business at 57c. Oats have advanced one cent during the week, with sales at 32c-33c. Canada red winter wheat, 91c-91.5c; white winter, 91c-92c; Canada spring, 91c-91.5c; peas, 68c-71c; oats, 32c-34c; rye, 65c-67c; barley, 50c-54c; corn, 60c. The stock of flour has increased 1,311 barrels during the week on receipts of 6,500, but is still less by 111,000 barrels than a year ago. The market today was quiet, with very little business in progress and that only in small lots. Values were not cited as nominally steady.

Local receipts by rail for the week February 13: Gazette Office, Saturday Evening, European Breadstuff. The British grain markets today were quiet and essentially unchanged, with the exception of corn in Liverpool which was firmer and 1/4d per cental dearer at 4s 2d. Wheat in the same market was very inactive with a poor demand at unchanged prices. Cargoes of wheat and corn in all positions were quiet but steady. Liverpool, February 1J A leading weekly grain circular says: The weather trade has been quiet this week. Values are generally unchanged. Indian wheats on the spot are in less supply, having sold freely. Other descriptions are neglected. Cargoes off coast are steadily held, but the demand is not active; for shipment there is more inquiry. At today’s market there was a poor attendance. A quiet tone prevailed. The business in wheat was limited at the late figures. Flour was slow and unchanged. Peas were steady. Beans were firm and dearer. United States Grain Markets. Wheat in Chicago was dull and featureless again, with light trading and very limited fluctuations, which did not exceed three-eighths of a cent for the whole session. It closed unchanged at 79.5c February, 79c March, 85c May. Corn was firm, closing a trifle better at 57c February, 37c March, 40c May. May oats were stronger and closed 1/4c higher at 32c. Feeder options were unchanged at 29.5c. Today’s inspection was 10 cars winter wheat, 40 spring, 256 corn, 135 oats, 1 rye, and 44 barley. A despatch to Maclver & Barclay says: The estimated receipts for tomorrow at Chicago are: Hogs, 18,000; wheat, 55 cars; corn, 350; oats, 50. Wheat closing quiet and easy, late cables are dull and lower. Pork declined on country realizing. Corn and oats steady. A private Chicago circular, dated Friday afternoon, says: The weather still continues soft all around, with the snow about all gone and frost well out of the ground, but it is said the wheat fields are looking well, and will be all right no doubt until we get a blizzard. Private cables say new crop of Indian wheat is now offering in London at less price than old crop, and looking at market from exporters' basis it certainly looks discouraging enough to holders. If we get a material advance now, it must come from domestic causes. We look upon the weather as the most important factor now in determining values. The trading today was very light, and as usual of purely local character. We must have an increased volume of speculative trade to lift the market out of control of local speculators. The leading operators here are largely short and disposed to fight any advance, and until they change sides can hardly expect a material advance. The New York wheat market was firm, and moved up, closing at 91.5c March, 82c April, 94.5c May, 96c June. Corn was strong and advanced 1/8c, closing at 60.5c March.

The St. Paul carnival cannot by any means be considered a success. Throughout the whole affair there was much that was incongruous. The idea of these sports to the Americans was a new one, but it was almost too much of a novelty. If tobogganing and snowshoeing with them does not suffer the fame of previous years, they will no doubt in time cultivate a liking for them. The carnival has not drawn the large number of people that was expected. Beyond the neighboring towns and cities, there were few visitors to St. Paul. From Canada, about all that attended were those from Winnipeg. The lack of visitors is accounted for by several causes. The project was not commenced soon enough, and consequently not advertised enough. The weather up to within two weeks of the date of the carnival was very mild. So much so, that it was a moot subject whether to abandon the scheme, or to utilize ice cream freezers and refrigerators. Then the blast came sudden and cold; and it was then claimed that the more southern people were afraid to encounter a possible blizzard. The railway fares were not reduced sufficiently enough to attract the large quantities of people, who always take advantage of low rates of passage, to make cheap excursions. Of course, as might be expected, comparisons were continually being made between the carnivals of Montreal and those of St. Paul. One constantly heard it on the street, and read it in the newspapers. The chief merit claimed for the St. Paul affair was the variety of costume. All classes of people formed themselves into toboggan clubs. They cared very little for the sport itself. In fact, they secured, as a rule, no toboggans; but they all purchased uniforms. The average strength of these clubs was about one hundred members; and there were said to be over seventy different clubs, all differently uniformed. Many of them were quaint and picturesque. It might be of interest to describe a few of them, to show to what extent the Americans tried to hit on new effects. One club was arrayed in tight-fitting scarlet, with hoods and black horns. The costume was a facsimile of MEPHISTO's in "FAUST." These were veritably a club of red devils. The "Mikado" craze was not without effect, for one club came out in Japanese costumes, with fans. Their drill included the striking of many quaint attitudes. Probably the most novel effect was the costume of "The Knights of the Grip" Toboggan Club. These were the commercial travelers. They were numerous and their banner proclaimed that twenty-six states were represented. They wore straw hats and long linen dusters. The temperature was low, but they carried palmetto fans and small grip sacks. Everyone has adopted the passing craze of coming out in costume. So common has it suddenly become that there are juvenile clubs, saloon keepers' clubs, clubs from the factories, colleges, mercantile houses, and government offices. The press of St. Paul is very good, very enterprising, and very patriotic. Illustrated journalism is a prominent feature, and the leading papers, the Pioneer Press, the Globe, and the Dispatch have their special artists. The portraiture is bad, but the illustrations of places and events are very good. They are most enthusiastic over the progress of the carnival, and the variations rung on the word success are many and frequent. They consider that the St. Paul carnival eclipses the palmiest days of the Mardi Gras of New Orleans, the Baltimore Orion, the St. Louis festivities; and as for Montreal or St. Petersburg, they are both forever banished to the cold shades of oblivion, so says the American press.

18860219: B, which was the last boat of Brewster, was hauled off this morning by tug and taken to Provincetown, where she will reload and tow to Boston. Vessel in fair condition. Rev. Sam Jones is a man of medium height and slender form, with dark complexion, dark hair, and a heavy moustache, which receives considerable attention from the ends. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

of his fingers when he is not speaking. He is now 38 years old. He began with the law and whiskey, but was converted and left off both and went to preaching. This was about fourteen years ago. He began to acquire local fame about two years ago. Talmage is credited with his discovery. He comes before his audience in a countrified way, swaying on one leg with one hand in his pocket. He has a fairly good voice, is deliberate in his manner, and gives his audience ample time to laugh at his numerous jokes. He has much to say, and in this respect is the opposite of Harrison, who had little to say, but kept up the motions. His style is argumentative and abounds in telling illustrations. He is not restrained by rules of speech, but goes straight to his point either along or across the lines of grammar as best suits his convenience. His drawing power is his wit, and all his printed sermons are full of "laughter." Some patriotic but jocular person at Ipswich, Dakota, has caused to be promulgated, by means of the Associated Press, a statement to the effect that the weather in his blizzard-prone state is warm and sultry, and that the farmers are at work in the fields. The statement requires interpretation. It is warm in Dakota when the thermometer stands at 20 above, and when the mercury falls to zero it is sultry. The farmers then work in the fields, cutting up their fences into firewood to be used during the next blizzard, and digging dead cattle out of the snowbanks to save their hides from the wolves. This explanation makes the Ipswich man's statement intelligible.

Hamilton Spectator, Feb. 25, 1886. Absolutely Pure. This powder never varies. A marvel of purity, strength, and wholesomeness. Made from cream of tartar derived from the grapes. Sold in bulk by dealers in low-grade, short-weight alum or phosphate powders. 

18860225: ANOTHER BLIZZARD COMING. Washington, February 21. The Chief of the Bureau of Statistics estimates that the annual revenue under the Morrison tariff will be $20,170,000. Of the 2,500,000 pounds of sugar imported into the United States during the last fiscal year, 74 percent came from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and the British West Indies. These countries, according to the latest advices, impose an export duty on sugar. If such is the fact, it is probable that 80 percent of the sugar imported last year came from countries imposing an export duty thereon. This would change the estimated reduction on sugar from $10,000,000 to $2,000,000, and the aggregate reduction of duty from $14,000,000 to $12,000,000. The import of articles of timber and lumber enumerated in the bill as directed by the proviso as to export duty are imported from Canada, which country, so far as learned, imposes no export duty on the articles specified. Therefore, the proviso has little or no effect. The Chief of the Bureau of Statistics, in a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury, explaining his computations, says that the effect which this bill will have upon the volume of imports is a matter of speculation and conjecture, but that the general effect of a reduction in duty is, of course, to increase importation. There are, however, so many elements in the problem that it would be hazardous to venture an opinion on the subject.

A Fight for Her Hand. Sandwich, Mass., February 21. Since last spring, a fair Swedish girl, named Christina, has alternately toyed with the affections of two stalwart farm hands of her own race. Yesterday the two men repaired with a few friends to a secluded spot to fight out the differences with bare fists, the loser agreeing to keep away from the girl. They fought till neither had strength enough to come into the scratch, and the battle was declared a draw, the contestants having to be carried home.

Prisoners Pardoned. Amass, February 24. The Governor signed a bill today providing for the commutation of sentences of convicts for good behavior, which affects nearly five thousand prisoners of the higher grades. The result of the bill is more far-reaching than any measure of its kind which has become law during the past twenty-five years. The act was drawn by Mr. Goodwin Brown, the pardon clerk of the Executive chambers, as a result of thirty years' study and observation by him.

Another Blizzard. St. Paul, February 24. Advices from points northwest of here indicate that a blizzard is sweeping down from beyond the British border headed southeast. At 10 o'clock tonight, the wind was blowing at Haugen'sville, Minn., from thirty-five to forty miles an hour, and it was snowing furiously. The mercury here is descending rapidly under the influence of a cold cutting wind of considerable velocity from the direction of the storm center.

18860303: UNITED STATES DISPATCHES. Fatal Accidents on the Grand Trunk. Portland, March 1. At a Chicago revival meeting, an accident occurred to the Central Vermont train. The train, which left here at 1:30 p.m., was running near Lock's Mills last night with two engines and a snowplow. The plow struck a bank of hard-packed snow and tore up a section of the road, throwing the engines from the track. The first engine went down a six-foot embankment and struck on its side. Engineer Mitchell escaped, but Fireman Martin, in the act of jumping, was struck in the middle of the bank, his hip being dislocated and his abdomen crushed. Mechanic Philbrick, of the second engine, crawled through steam and hot water to the spot where Martin lay under his engine and pulled him out of a position where he might have been horribly injured. Philbrick then fell senseless by Martin's side. The cold was intense. The engines of both went off. The men were removed to Fennant's pond and efforts were made to revive Martin to ease his terrible agony until he died.

A new plow, running ahead of the Montreal express for Island Pond yesterday, struck an obstruction and turned upside down. Eight men were in the plow at the time. Almond Smith, of Island Pond, had an inch bolt driven into his forehead, killing him. Chadwick, of Island Pond, was injured internally and died shortly after. Two or three others were seriously injured, but will recover.

At the First Baptist Church yesterday, Rev. Sam Jones said: "What a privilege it is to pray! Now I want all those who went down on their knees and prayed before they came to this meeting to rise in their seats." About twenty persons arose. The evangelist leaned against the pulpit and seemed to gasp for breath. "You may be scared now," he said. "Why, brethren, you would find more prayerful Christians in Hong Kong, China, than there are in this meeting tonight. If you can't pray, I want you to take your carcasses out of here. I don't want you to come here if you can't pray." An aged man, sitting in one of the front pews, leaped to his feet and in a bittering voice said: "Mr. Jones, I don't think it is necessary for a person to get down on his knees to pray. I consider myself a good Christian and I do not like to hear such talk." "I was about to say the same thing," exclaimed Rev. Mr. Scudder, of Plymouth church. "I prayed while on my way to church. God does not demand that a man shall get down on his knees before his prayers are heard." "Any more exculpatory remarks?" drawled the evangelist. Dr. Scudder: "They are not exculpatory remarks." A man with an ear trumpet, who punctuated his remarks with vigorous pounding on the rostrum, said: "Mr. Jones, I did not have time to get down on my knees to pray for this meeting. I have spent nearly the entire day reading the Bible to a gambler and a drunkard, and I think I am entitled to respect here." Other men and several women began to stand up in various sections of the church, but a few explanatory remarks served to still the tempest, and the revivalist was permitted to finish his sermon without further interruption. In conclusion, he said: "Let us take the lesson in the text to our homes, and get some food out of it."

A Fatal Prohibition Quarrel. Chicago, March 2. A telegram from Milledgeville, Ga., says: The killing of Marshal Haygood by Sam Ennis on Saturday has given a bloody culmination to one of the bitterest contests over prohibition yet conducted in Georgia. Both parties charge the other with inciting to riot and bloodshed. The prohibitionists brought Sam Jones, the evangelist, here. He delivered a speech and preached a sermon. The anti-prohibitionists allege that he advised the prohibitionists to be ready to fight if necessary, to secure the polling of their votes, and recommended that they should go to the polls armed with pistols. The prohibitionists admit that Jones made use of some such expressions, but they insist that he meant that the prohibitionists should stand firm for their rights and nothing more. Immediately after the terrible tragedy, such expressions as these were common: "It was Sam Jones' work" and "How will Sam Jones feel when he hears to what his incendiary utterances have led?" Jones, who is in Chicago, was shown the above dispatch tonight. He said: "I think my name is connected with that affair in order that it might be more sensational. I never made an incendiary speech in my life. In the town of Milledgeville, I said, 'You men who are prohibitionists, be prudent, but stand by your convictions. If these liquor men try to frighten you by cursing or drawing their weapons on you, tell them you have been bullied as long as you intend to be, and if they can die for their infernal traffic, you can die in defense of the helpless women and children of this country, and if they want to run that game of guns and pistols on you, tell them they must strike the first lick, and then you will feed the blizzards with them if you can, but don't you ever strike the first blow.'"

Accident on the Central Vermont. St. Albans, Vt., March 2. A peculiar accident occurred this morning to the first Boston express from Montreal, due here at 10:50. Just as the train reached the crossing, a short distance from the St. Albans depot, it was thrown from the track down into a meadow. The engine kept the track, but the baggage car, Pullman, and an ordinary coach ran off. The baggage car was upset, but the other two kept right up. Nobody was hurt. It is supposed the cause of the accident was spreading of the rails.

Burned to Death. Fulton, Mo., March 2. Neighbors rushing to the burning house, occupied by Mrs. Quisenberry and her two sons, aged seventeen and nineteen, heard low cries of distress and found Mrs. Quisenberry lying in the yard, partly wrapped in a blanket. Her sons were not in sight but were supposed to be inside. Their charred remains were found in the ruins after the fire subsided.

Huston, March 2 — Rev.

Vienna Tract. Vienna, April 10 — Kerr Seriony, a high Hungarian railway official, has been arrested in connection with the death of his daughter Irma. The latter, after a quarrel with her stepmother, took phosphorus. She was locked in a room by her stepmother, who forbade her servants to open the door until the girl's screams had ceased.

The French Chambers. Paris, April 10 — In the Chamber of Deputies today, a Radical motion censuring the Government for the arrest of M. Rothschild and Duquesney at D'Amiens, in connection with the riots, was discussed. The debate resulted in a vote of confidence in the Government by 435 to 69. The Senate voted urgency for M. Roserain's bill enlarging the powers of the Executive so as to enable it to deal with strikes. One hundred and fifty-three members voted in the affirmative and one hundred and two in the negative.

The French in Senegal. Paris, April 10 — Advices from Senegal say that a large body of natives attacked Dakar and a sanguinary conflict ensued. The garrison at Dakar made a sortie and drove back the attacking party. For three days there was desperate fighting in the neighboring villages.

In view of the alliance, the Princess is being educated in the Protestant faith and her life and habits of thought will be molded as far as possible on the English basis.

The London Stock Exchange. London, April 11 — Discount was weak at 1% for three months and 1.75% for short. On the stock exchange, during the week, absolute stagnation prevailed, owing to the uncertain political situation. Leading brokers say they are hardly clearing enough to pay their clerks. Prices were steady. American railway securities shared in the inaction. Quotations were maintained until yesterday when there was a lower tendency.

The London Socialists Acquitted. London, April 10 — The trial of Burns, Hyndmann, Champion, and William, the Socialist leaders, was concluded this afternoon. The jury rendered a verdict of not guilty and the defendants were discharged.

An Egyptian Scandal. Cairo, April 10 — A committee appointed to inquire into the management of the Egyptian finance ministry has found a public official named Addah guilty of extortion.

MAYMTOH1 MAS MULCTED. Thomas Kidgory experiences a Hyperborean Day in New York. Boston, April 10 — A New York dispatch to the Herald says Thomas Kidgory, an honest grocer of Winnipeg, Man., came here by special blizzard in response to sawdust circles to buy $3,000 in counterfeit Canadian money for $250. He wanted to give it to the poor in Winnipeg. He put up at the Union Square hotel on Wednesday. John Carroll, of No. 126 Spring street, met him, carried him off to a 119 South street, and introduced him to Charles Folsome. Folsome showed him a pile of genuine Canadian money, promised to send $5,000 worth around to Kidgory's hotel, and got the $250 out of him. No money, of course, was sent to the hotel. Kidgory had Carroll arrested, but Folsome cannot be found. To his great surprise, the honest grocer was sent to the house of detention today to ensure his appearance against his honest friend.

cd against him in determining what weight should be given to their testimony. But, in spite of their perjuries, if their testimony had been corroborated by other facts and circumstances, then the jury would be warranted in finding that they had told the truth. Dully, however, should not be allowed to corroborate Kullgruff or Kullg-aff. Dully Koch must be corroborated by testimony outside of the other. The jury had the absolute right to discard the testimony of both. The recorder drew the attention of the jury to the fact that the defendant was not charged with receiving a bribe, but with having made a promise to, or an agreement with someone, that his vote as an alderman of New York should be cast in favor of the charter of the Broadway Surface railroad. The charge on the whole was regarded as favorable to the prisoner, and was objected to on several grounds by the District Attorney. At 9 o'clock the jury went out to deliberate. At 10 o'clock tonight the jury once more entered the court, reported that they were unable to agree, and asked to be discharged, stating that there was no seeming possibility of their coming to a unanimous verdict. Recorder Smythe was unwilling to agree to this request, in view of the importance of the case, and the fact that the prosecution of the rest of the thirteen will probably hang upon the result of this trial, and ordered them back till tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. A private telegram in this city last evening stated that eight jurymen were in favor of acquitting McQuade and four against.

**Arrested Blizzard Making Things Lively in Northern Dakota and Minnesota**

St. Paul, November 23. The second blizzard of the season reached Dakota early yesterday. The storm is coming from the northeast. Portland reports twelve inches of snow and drifting badly. Jamestown reports passenger trains on time, but freights abandoned. At Grafton at 10 p.m., the thermometer showed 16 above and was falling rapidly. Fargo reports four inches of snow.

**Asking for a Divorce**

Chicago, November 30. Society is agitated over a suit for divorce brought against William H. Ferry, a well-known citizen, by his wife, the daughter of John V. Farwell. Mrs. Ferry accuses her husband of an inordinate desire for money and of being exacting and brutal in his nature.

**The President's Message**

**A Gigantic Defalcation**

Denver, Col., November 30. A report has been received from Fort Collins that F. L. Carter, manager of the Poudre Canal and Land Company, has disappeared; it is supposed he absconded, leaving indebtedness amounting to $306,000, all secured except $75,000.

**Another Cloud Man Gone Wrong**

Portland, November 30. Howard Blackstone, discount clerk of the Canal National Bank, has absconded, after embezzling $5,000.

**A Ride in a Blizzard**

Bismarck, Dak., November 30. A report of army officers who have arrived at Fort Yates gives a description of the thrilling ride in the history of the army. They were seventy hours in a blizzard in coming from Fort Lincoln, a distance of sixty miles, or over an hour to a mile. Their vehicle was an ambulance and was drawn by four mules. During Monday night, when the blizzard was at its height, they were compelled to shovel and plunge their way through snow drifts from six to ten feet deep, and the continual use of the whip and goading sticks was necessary to keep the exhausted animals on the walk. The officers state that at the time the blizzard hid the mules from view, and that but for the instinct of the animals, they would have been lost and frozen to death. At one point they passed an Indian camp, but the savages would not give them shelter, as their superstition taught them that this would be fatal to them. They arrived at Fort Lincoln without a covering to their ambulance, this protection having been blown away by the first night's wind, and within thirty minutes from their arrival one of the animals dropped dead. It was a fight for life for seventy-two hours, and they describe the trip as a most horrible experience, compared with which a march against an opposing army would be a pleasant pastime. France and Mexico have concluded a treaty of commerce.

**GOOD BOYS AND THEIR PRINCIPLES**

The Grits have been too good boys. They have, in a very dogged way, stood on principles when they might easily have seen the country did not want principles. The above, from the Witness of last night, is suggestive of the idea that the author was in an ironical humor when he penned it. The goodness of the Grit boys has been of a peculiar kind. Their robe of righteousness has very much resembled the garb of that plausible gentleman known to fame as Mr. Worldly Wiseman. They have interpreted the apostolic injunction to be all things to all men in the wrong sense. Perhaps they got astray by accepting the version of the Scriptures prepared by Mr. Tross instead of adhering to the authorized translation of King James. Anyway, they have become sadly mixed in their striving after righteousness, or what they no doubt thought was just as good a thing, power over the government of the country. Their path has been sadly beset. There have been many stumbling blocks in their way. They have been oftentimes led astray by false prophets. They have sought to "put down bribery and corruption" with "lots of money." Special brands of "raspberry syrup" have been prepared wherewith to lubricate the throat of the unwary voter and through that channel affect his heart in favor of their cause. A light lantern brigade has been organized and has operated on their behalf in constituencies where they were likely to do the most good. A special ballot box was designed in their interest, and managed with efficiency. A gerrymander that out-gerrymandered all other gerrymanders has been framed in Ontario for their special benefit, and the principle declared that six thousand Grit voters were entitled to as great representation in the Legislature as ten thousand Tories. Their "too goodness" has been peculiar, and the Witness must have been mocking them when it spoke of it. So with the principles on which our contemporary says they have stood in a "dogged way." They have indeed stood on an immense lot of principles in their time. It would be hard to get a principle that they have not stood on to their detriment. They stood on the principle that it was wrong to construct the Pacific railway throughout Canadian territory; they stood on the principle that it was wrong to secure to the workingmen of this country the benefit of the markets of this country in opposition to the manufacturers of a foreign state; they stood on the principle that it was wrong to extend the franchise to the young men of the nation, and on the principle that the Canadian Northwest was inferior to the blizzard-swept plains of Dakota and Kansas. Today in Nova Scotia they stand on the principle that the federation should be broken up; in Quebec on the principle that treason and rebellion and murder should not be punished, and that the volunteers who risked and lost their lives to maintain the integrity of the Empire were assassins and pillagers; in Ontario they support this view, and the leader of the government telegraphed his congratulations on the supposed success of a politician who fought an election on the revenge cry and has, as one of his first lieutenants, a man who upholds the principle of driving the British out of the province. In the Northwest four or five years ago their principles were enunciated in a manifesto warning emigrants not to go into the country. The Witness was never nearer the truth in its existence than when it said the country did not want principles of this kind, and until the good boys of the Grit party learn this, appreciate the fact that Canada is a nation, whose people take pride in her prosperity and her progress, and take their stand on some principles that one who calls himself a Canadian can enunciate without hanging his head in shame, they will continue "in a very dogged way" to remain just where they are, and where it is well for the country they should be. The Dublin Express pithily summarizes the situation in Ireland, as regards the rent reduction agitation, when it says either the government of Mr. Dillon must go down. After going the length he did, to stop in his course now would be a confession of weakness on Mr. Dillon's part that would probably result in his losing considerable influence among his followers. His own language does not convey the impression that he intends to desist from the agitation, and we will probably before long hear of his getting into further trouble, as the government, after its recent declarations, will have to keep up the policy it has entered upon, of maintaining, with a strong hand, the administration of the law as it exists today. Alderman Grenier was the subject of a very virulent personal attack in yesterday's Herald. The chairman of the Finance Committee has his faults, like other men, but he has his good qualities as well, and his services to the city have been recognized by all who have watched the administration of its affairs. Such onslaughts as the Herald people have made upon him will have little effect upon the position he holds in the public estimation. He has before incurred the enmity of that journal, and has lived through the storm period without any outward sign of distress. He will, no doubt, be able to bear up equally well against the present cyclone of vituperation. The Herald's enmity these days is a thing less dangerous than its friendship. The state authorities of New Hampshire have been discussing a question that has come up for consideration in some of the Canadian legislatures—the justice of the law that requires the individual states to maintain prisoners convicted of offenses against the federal law. The New Hampshire officials have decided that they will not receive such prisoners in the future, thus bringing the matter to a crisis, in the hope that the central government will build penitentiaries for its own offenders. The case in the United States is different in some respects from that in Canada. There the Federal Government has no prisons whatever, whereas here the Dominion takes charge in the various penitentiaries of those guilty of the graver offenses. The matter is one, however, in which the people are not particularly interested. The cost falls equally upon them, whatever set of officials looks after the lawbreakers. The Canadian Gazette claims Dr. Goldwin Braith as a convert to Imperial Federation on the ground of some remarks that he made at a dinner given by the National Club, Toronto, Lieut.-Col. Denison in the chair. On that occasion, Prof. Smith is reported to have stoutly maintained the cause of a coiled empire. Possibly his mind may have undergone a change in the direction indicated, but, if even the Canadian Omnibus is aware, he was not half as opposed to the federation when it was impracticable. Of late, Dr. Smith's thoughts have run a good deal on the subject of Ireland and Mr. Gladstone's rejection of home rule, and it is not...

It is unlikely that when he stoutly maintained the cause of a united empire, it was Italy that occupied his attention. The Canadian journalist, however, interprets his words otherwise and begins to look confidently forward to his becoming an active member of the league at a distant date. "These were wonderful solid wisdom that fell from the lips of Mr. Arthur, head of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, at the late convention of that body: There seems to be a universally prevalent idea that all capitalists are rich, whereas the truth is that no great business enterprise is owned and controlled by one man, but by many, each contributing something towards the mighty whole. I will venture to say that most men of thirty, industrious habits are almost. When we consider that capital is not invested wealth, I maintain there is not one among you, my hearers, who cannot consider himself a capitalist, be you ever so small. The whole world can say hear, hear, to such sentiments, and were they better appreciated by the masses, the disturbing trade of the capitalists would lose its profit, and he would stand a chance of personally appreciating some of the experiences of him whose lot it is to be a working man. 

In reality, it was certainly unfortunate," my learned friend continued, "that in the Lord Mayor's show Canada should have been represented by a model of the unpainted lumber at Montreal. But the fact that so much indignation has been taken of the matter appears to us a subject for congratulation. A few years ago no one would have either known or cared about the appropriateness of any colonial emblem. Now all is changed, and it is just because people are waking up to the grand climate and resources of Canada that they perceive the absurdity of representing her by Arctic symbols. We are convinced that better knowledge of the Empire will lead to keener appreciation of its value; and when the British nation once realizes that the Empire is practically worth preserving, a matter of X s d, if nothing higher, we shall see the movement for Imperial federation advance even more rapidly than at present towards its final consummation." 

It is well at any rate to maintain a hopeful spirit. The advisability of equipping the police force with firearms is a question on both sides of which something may be said. We do not think a good case was made out by the authorities of the force in favor of their recommendation, discussed by the City council on Monday, or that the state of the city calls for such a radical change, which would place in the hands of a body of men, open to considerable improvement in many ways, the power of taking life. But we think there is a point at which criticism of the police should cease. Aid McShane went beyond this in the council meeting, and so did the Herald yesterday, when, in assailing the management and personnel of the force, they encouraged the lawless element which has in the past taken the lives of faithful officers to arm themselves with revolvers with which to resist the police in the discharge of their duties. The roughs of the community do not need encouragement to do this, and they who offer it are enemies to the city.

18870115: 10, C Vt, 8:40 p.m., 2 hours late. South Eastern, due at 8:30 p.m., 2 hours late. No. 4, East, due at 8:12 p.m., cancelled. So far, this winter has been an exceptionally hard one so far as snowstorms are concerned. Yesterday's snowstorm was declared to be the heaviest of the season, and the railway officials fear that traffic will be seriously impeded. At an early hour the storm had not caused much delay to the service, but as the snow fell steadily the whole day and evening, accompanied by a blizzard in the country, there is every likelihood of a block occurring. The number of farmers who arrived in the city yesterday was small, notwithstanding that it was market day. The few who did face the terrific storm complain bitterly of the trouble experienced in reaching the city, owing to the heavy roads and blinding storm, and state that it is the worst they have been subjected to for several years past. The storm evidently prevailed throughout the whole province.

18870119: AN ADMIRER. Montreal, 18th January, 1880. THE HEAVY ROADS, The Work of the Turnpike Trust Company Complained Of. A resident of the Upper Lachine road, who supplies milk in the city, stated to a Gazette reporter yesterday evening that the Lachine roads were very heavy after Monday night's blizzard, and that he wished to complain that the Turnpike Trust makes no extra provision for a heavy storm like the one in question, and that the milkmen especially, who have to come into the city early in the morning, are obliged to make their way as best they can through the heavy drifts. Although some seven or eight inches of snow fell on Monday, up to 8 o'clock that evening no snow plough had gone over the road, and yesterday morning it took him an hour and three-quarters to come to the tollgate (two miles). He claims that instead of the men employed by the Trust commencing at 5 or 6:30 having quietly waited to do a regular day's work, they should get the men out early in the morning, knowing that the milkmen especially have to get to town early and if they are late, more particularly those who supply the hotels, they are certain to lose their customers. The tolls, he considers, are quite heavy enough to have the roads properly looked after. 

A hanging scene was one of the thrilling features of a drama at a theatre in San Antonio, Texas, and a concealed rope placed around the body of the man who acted the part of the victim was to keep the strain off the noose around his neck. The concealed rope failed to connect the other night and the man, after a realistic hanging scene, was cut down for dead, but by hard work was restored to consciousness.

18870208: A BLIZZARD OF SLANDER. In the Lower Province Getting Desperate. BRIGHT CONSERVATIVE PROSPECTS. Effect of Sir Charles Tupper's Return. Late Political News by Telegraph (from our own Correspondent). Halifax, N.S., February 7. The contest in Nova Scotia has assumed some extraordinary features within the past few days. Sir Charles Tupper's arrival has already resulted in straightening out affairs in the Liberal Conservative party, and in thorough organization, the Conservative prospects in Halifax have been vastly improved during the past week, and the speeches of Sir Charles Tupper, Mr. Blair, and Mr. Kenny have had an electrical effect. Mr. Kenny's speech exposing Grit hypocrisy in mixing the miserable cause of Blake with the sacred cause of home rule in Ireland has produced a revolution among Irish Catholics and a mailed reaction in favor of the Liberal-Conservative candidate. Mr. Jones opened his campaign by claiming the election of nineteen Secessionists from Nova Scotia. Since then the Grit cause has become desperate, and the more disheartening it becomes the more abusive and audacious they become. Their campaign has degenerated into A BLIZZARD OF SLANDER AND BLUSTER. 

Ten days ago I announced that Duncan McDonald had been accepted by the Conservatives of Victoria as a compromise Conservative candidate, and that our party, having united, McCurdy, who had been nominated months previously by the Grits, had ignominiously backed out of the fight. The Grit organs immediately claimed McDonald as a Liberal candidate, insisted that it was the Tories who backed down, and have ever since paraded his name in their standing announcement of candidates as a Liberal standard bearer elected by acclamation. Today the announcement is made that, notwithstanding their official statement, their wire-pullers have been working with all their might to induce McCurdy to re-enter the field and face the music, and notwithstanding McCurdy's written pledges to McDonald not to oppose him, he has now entered the field as a secession candidate. Under these circumstances, McDonald announces his willingness to retire and give his enthusiastic support to John A. MacDonald, barrister, as a straight Conservative candidate. In Pictou, the Grits only nominated one candidate for the two seats, and Adam C. Boil, Conservative, the Labor candidate, has retired and accepted the Liberal-Conservative nomination for Guysboro, where Dr. Cudogan is running as a straight Secessionist candidate against Mr. Kirk, Grit. Great interest is manifested as to whether James A. Fraser, THE APOSTLE OF REPEAL, will support the Grit or secession candidate in Yarmouth.

18870212: THE BALL. There was no carnival outdoors yesterday. The weather was unpropitious in the strictest sense of the word. It blew a regular blizzard, as only a Canadian blizzard can blow, but it was carnival ball day, or rather evening. Citizens patiently resigned themselves to keep within doors, and visitors enjoyed the pleasing quietude and comfort of their hotels, all awaiting the ball in the evening, which neither the wind nor the snow could disturb. It was as much as a man's life was worth to venture for a long journey through the streets. So our American cousins thought, and so Canadians, to a large extent, agreed with them, and all remained within doors until the evening. Talk of your public balls and annual festivals in the city. They are grand, it is true. The Caledonians and the Commercial Travellers, and the other societies annually make a display of festivity worthy of the importance of the city, but the Carnival ball last evening excelled all. It was a scene of grandeur and a scene of beauty unexcelled in the history of the city. The Windsor hotel was more beautiful than ever, more beautiful in its floral decorations and beautiful in the usual dignity of its ball room and corridors. Perhaps it was well that the committee did not draw the rigid line of fancy dresses for participants in the ball. There is difficulty about obtaining fancy dresses, especially for visitors, and the pleasing fact that our cousins across the line joined in great numbers in the festivities of the evening may be attributed to the mercantile "evening dress" being the rule. Supper was prepared for 1,200, so Mr. Isaac Ebbits, the steward of the Windsor, said, but the chef must have doubled the supply, because there must at least have been 1,500 present, and they all seemed to have enjoyed the supper, which was not the least important part in the evening's bill of fare of amusement. It was truly a Carnival night. When you see old and dignified men, the gay cavalier, and the handsome lady enjoying the dance together, there must be something unusual in the air. The gay grandsire, skilled in mystic lore, frisked beneath the burden of threescore. So Goldsmith wrote in the "Traveller" about the French peasantry of his day, and the couplet is applicable to many of our ancient city and American friends who joined in the ball last evening. Prominent and respected citizens, engaged in our trade and commerce, mingled in the participation of the fun with the young folks, and Carnival held high revel unmarred by a contrivance. Sufficient to say for the description of the ball, our readers who were not there can imagine its brilliance, and those who were there can blame the reporter for not conveying to the outside world the full measure of enjoyment which they felt. 

Was there a crush? So people will say, and so people will answer that there must have been. Well, there was a crush. There is always a feeling that a joyous ballroom is well filled with friends you know and friends you don't know; but there was not what some society people "call a crush."

**Crowd**: There was no inconvenience to the thousand and one who enjoyed the dancing or who visited as promenaders or sightseers. Here is a small idea of the floral decorations which added their charm to the scenery.

1887-02-14: ANOTHER BAD BLIZZARD. Pipestone, Minn., February 12. One of the worst blizzards of the season has been raging here for the last thirty-six hours. All trains on the Burlington road have been abandoned. It is thought there must be considerable suffering in the country. Egg poachers, of three or six rings, price only 35 and 65 cents. They make a fine dish of eggs all even. Potato presses, patent curtain stretchers, price $3.50 and $3 each.

1887-02-15: In helping to entertain some of the Boston Bicycle Club, who were very kind to the Montreal boys when down there, took them to the Park slide during the blizzard Friday. He had J. Paton's big toboggan and got six of a party on to take them down. He did it most efficiently for the hill was in terrible condition and the windup was in a snow bank on the side, out of which the Bostonians climbed completely covered with snow. "Call this fun," said one, "then count me out." They then started to coast down Cote des Neiges and they were again dumped into a bank. They left too soon to find out the real beauties of the sport and have not a very exalted opinion of it now.

A CYCLONE OF FALSEHOOD substituted for the Grit blizzard of slander. CONSERVATIVE VICTORY CERTAIN. Disgraceful Liberal tactics to amuse bare and religious prejudices. (From our own correspondent.) Halifax, N.S., February 18. The National Policy campaign in the Maritime Provinces goes bravely on, and its advocates are marching forward in a solid phalanx to certain victory. The fact that the Grits are not running candidates in five constituencies at all, viz., Pictou, Gloucester, King's, Ken, and Victoria, and that in a sixth their candidate is disqualified by not having resigned his seat in the local Legislature, thus giving the Government a gain of six seats to start with, is a most sickening blow to them. With such a splendid advantage already gained, our Upper province follow-Toryists do not need to be reassured that the party of progress and prosperity will hold their own in the other constituencies which the Grits have mustered up courage enough to contest. The Grits are in their last ditch and in their desperation they have substituted a cyclone of falsehood for their blizzard of slander. Their papers are lined with alarming dispatches from Montreal, Ottawa, and Toronto, giving the most grotesque accounts of how the whole Tory party is going to be annihilated in Ontario and Quebec on Tuesday, from which provinces they claim a forty majority for Blake, while they allege that all the members from Manitoba, Northwest, and British Columbia will support Blake. This is the story they tell in those provinces under the most startling headlines, but only the most gullible believe it as it is but a rehash of their dispatches in 1882 and 1884. These dispatches, however, are not without some humor. For instance, one says that "The Opposition to Alonzo Wright is more serious than many suppose," indicating that they themselves consider the opposition to him a huge joke. The Chronicle today claims Mr. Dupont as pledged to support Blake in one column, and in another denounces him for going back on his pledge and stumping for the Tories in Hochelaga. On the other hand, dispatches of a similarly grotesque character are sent from here to the Upper provinces to enable the organized appetite there to keep up courage. These dispatches conveniently ignore all the facts and make statements and claims as idiotic as they are false. If the Upper province Grits are pinning their faith on the Lower provinces, they will be as wilfully mistaken as they were four and eight years ago respectively. The Grits do not believe in their own claims, and although they say they will elect nineteen, they will not put up money on more than a majority. The Government will hold their own in the Maritime provinces. They may lose one or two seats, such as in Cape Breton, where two Grits are running against five Conservatives, but for every seat they lose, they will capture one from the Grits. Both four and eight years ago they made the most extravagant predictions about the Maritime provinces, declaring they were going to elect two-thirds in Nova Scotia, three-fourths in New Brunswick, and sweep Prince Edward Island. When the votes were counted it was all the other way, and it will be the same next Tuesday. The truth is that the Maritime Grits are in the depths of desperation. The Chronicle and Recorder are making shrieking appeals for repealers to come out and vote or else the great victory of June will be thrown away, and declaring that if they do not get a majority, repeal will be dead. On nomination day at Sydney, Murray, one of the Grit candidates, read what purported to be a telegram from Jones, saying that Blake will not abolish the coal duties if he succeeds in obtaining power. Last night at Waverley, Jones distinctly stated that the abolition of the coal duties was a plank of Blake's platform, and that he (Jones) fully concurred in the wisdom of such a policy. He argued that the coal duty was no good to any person except "a few foreign capitalists," and he reiterated the declaration that he would vote against the coal duty tomorrow as well as the duty on Yankee flour. The Grits are making tremendous but vain efforts to capture the French Acadian vote by stirring up race and religious issues. Catholic missionaries are at work among the French of Westmoreland, where, at Shediac...

**THE CARNIVAL**: More than One Hundred Thousand People Handled. The involved record of the number of passengers who arrived at Bonaventure depot during carnival week will prove of interest to the public generally, and particularly to the people of Montreal, who contributed to the signal success of the event. A period of such variable and severe weather as was experienced in Montreal during that week was never before known. On Tuesday, a sleet and rain storm set in, after which came severe frost. The flanges of the rails were full and solid and the ice required to be picked out inch by inch. During the day on Wednesday and Thursday, finer weather set in. The nights were, however, very stormy with snow. This was followed by a perfect blizzard on Friday, resulting in an entire suspension of traffic. Saturday morning the weather was fairly good, but the station and yard were literally choked with snow and cars embedded therein. Unfortunately, on Saturday evening the weather turned excessively cold, the thermometer falling to 15 below zero. The engine power became almost paralyzed in consequence. Having to contend with all these difficulties, it is to the credit of the Grand Trunk Railway company that with the present facilities at Bonaventure depot they handled 2,306 cars and 105,020 passengers, coming and going, without the slightest injury to life or limb. The record is as follows: Report of passengers arriving at Bonaventure station during Carnival week, with number of passenger cars and the divisions over which they ran.

**1887-02-26**: A dispatch says: The storm which commenced yesterday afternoon caused the most serious blockade of the season throughout northern New Hampshire and Vermont. The temperature suddenly fell below zero and the wind blowing a gale all night completely stopped railroad traffic until this morning. Farmington, Me., February 25. A regular blizzard has prevailed here since yesterday. A snowstorm raged in the forenoon, about six inches falling before night, and a gale followed. Immense drifts block all roads and passenger trains are canceled, something which has not happened before for over twenty years. Reports from the Sandy River and Franklin & Megantic railroads (narrow gauge) state that trains are snowbound on the former road at Phillips and on the latter road at Strong. Travel and business in North Franklin is entirely suspended. Carter's Little Liver Pills must not be confounded with common cathartic or purgative pills as they are entirely unlike them in every respect. One trial will prove their superiority.

**A Legislative Deadlock**: Charleston, W.V., February 25. The Legislative session closed today. The deadlock on the United States senatorship remained unbroken. This leaves the appointment to the Governor, who will most likely appoint a man with free trade ideas. 

**Another Blizzard in the West**: Bismarck, D.T., February 25. A terrible blizzard is blowing in the West. A Northern Pacific eastbound passenger train is snowed in near Sentinel Butte. Hon. Henry L. Cutting, Sr., the New York broker, died suddenly yesterday morning. Four cases of smallpox have been reported since Thursday in Holyoke, Mass. Rev. Jas. Freeman Clarke, the eminent Unitarian divine, of Boston, is seriously ill. The snow blockade on the railways near St. Johnsbury, Vt., is the worst this season. The condition of George Bancroft, the historian, who has been ill of pneumonia, is much improved. Commodore William T. Truxton, United States Navy, retired, died suddenly yesterday afternoon at Norfolk, Va. Gerald Maxwell, the son of Miss M.E. Braddon, the novelist, has recovered from the attack of insanity and will return to England in a few days.

**1887-03-31: A Drive Over the Scene**: "I am afraid I cannot get through here, sir," said the carter to the reporter. There was a huge snowdrift on the Black River road, beyond the Mile End. The snow was piled ten feet high on each side, as the horse struggled through, and the sleigh was tugged along now on one side, then on the other. The wind blew half a gale, driving the pinching snow into the faces of the carter and his passenger. It was a bitter March day, and in its wintry discomfort more like a blizzard day in January. If the poor student were out in such weather, and in such a blizzard, he would have little hope of reaching shelter. On went the sleigh until the imposing and comfortable hotel of Pierre Frigon was reached. Here the missing student was last seen in company with his friends. Should the lost one not be recovered, the hostelry will become famous as the central figure in one of the most extraordinary mysteries which has ever startled society in Montreal.

**Searching for the Dead Body of a Friend**: "Gentlemen, go down to the little bush over there and search it; maybe the poor creature has got in there," Pierre Frigon, an old man, sixty-eight years of age, with a long white beard, thus addressed three young...

18870406: SNOW BLOCKADE IN MICHIGAN. Milwaukee, April 5. Despatches from Northern Michigan and Wisconsin report one of the worst blizzards of the season. Snow is a foot deep and Michigan railroads are blockaded. Chief Justice Cameron, of Ontario, and Chief Justice Stuart, of Quebec, Knighted. London, April 5. Chief Justices Cameron, of Ontario, and Stuart, of Quebec, have been made Knights Bachelor. Sir Matthew Crooks Cameron was born in Dundas, in 1823, educated at Upper Canada College and called to the Bar in 1849, and created Queen's Counsel in 1893. He sat for North Ontario in the Canadian Assembly from 1861 to Confederation, and was soon after elected to the Ontario Assembly for Toronto East, a seat which he retained until 1878, when he was raised to the bench. He was a member of the Sandfield Macdonald administration from July, 1867, to December, 1871, holding the office of provincial secretary and commissioner of Crown lands. He led the Opposition in the Ontario Assembly from 1871 to 1875. He is Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. Sir Andrew Stuart is, we believe, the oldest judge on the bench of the Superior Court of this province, and has been Chief Justice since March, 1885. His residence is at Quebec, where he is personally held in high estimation.

18870411: THE DISAPPEARANCE. In the Gazette of March 31st, appeared a detailed account of poor farmer's disappearance from Frigon's hotel. The last who saw him was Patrick Murphy, an employee on the seminary farm, and the body was found about half a mile from the spot he last saw him. The unfortunate young man missed the road and was lost in the blizzard. ON THE BRANCH. On Saturday afternoon Chief Detective Cullen and Detective Lipton arranged with Mr.

18870518: OCT 07 THE RUNNING. There was a little discussion as to the prospects of foreign competition in the meat trade at a recent meeting of the Cirencester Chamber of Agriculture. The president said that from information furnished him by the secretary, he learned that recent blizzards and snowstorms, and the generally severe weather, had so decimated the herds on American ranches that they would probably be out of the running as regarded store stock for the next two or three years, and therefore there was no immediate danger, but it would recur.

18870704: S informed Toronto, and Toronto kindly wired the Intelligence back to us. The tidings are disheartening, no doubt, but silvered over by the reflection that if these 7,000 had remained they might have proved of that stripe who bow the knee to the idol of discontent. We have a fair supply already of that species of bird that defiles its own nest. Meanwhile, a few authenticated statistics from Mr. S would be in order. For myself, I must believe that gentleman; but all non-grievancers hereabouts pronounce the statement a well, say a fib. Could I trust my own observation as I do Mr. Silcox, I should give it the same name, or a stronger. Desirable settlers are not leaving the country. Some who, in their haste to get rich, got immersed in debt instead, and hopelessly mortgaged through their recklessness, have slipped over the line. Others, finding the atmosphere here too hot for such characters as themselves, have done likewise. Is this a proof of stagnation or decay? Is it a reason for a "change of management?" I see thousands of farmers growing wealthy all around me; indeed all who deserve to prosper are prospering, and I have yet to learn the first instance of one of these solid fellows pulling up stakes for Dakota or any other state. True, though I live in the midst of them, I may not have seen things. They may have gone under cover of the night, calling upon Mr. Silcox at Winnipeg with a fresh budget of woes. True, there is a large Canadian population south of the boundary, but they did not go thither as a rule from the Northwest. They settled there before this country was surveyed or open for settlement, not at all from preference but of necessity. To their credit be it spoken, these earlier settlers upheld their adopted country. Their correspondence with friends and relatives eastward portrayed the land in bright, not dismal colors. In fact, had they done otherwise Jonathan would have very properly kicked them out long ago. And so the number of Canadians multiplied, drawn chiefly from Ontario and other eastern provinces. This clear stream is still flowing, I believe, but not from Manitoba; what little they get from us is muddy. More than this: Not a few of these people are now seeking homesteads in our country. Why? Because of our superior advantages. They know all about us independent of Farmers' Union manifestoes, Winnipeg ebullitions and Silcoxian orations. Living on our borders, they have the means of forming a correct judgment from personal observation and contact with our people, and that judgment is in our favor. The dismal howl of the agitator makes the Dakotan smile, for he knows the facts of our case and his own. He knows that our soil is at least equal to his. He knows that our taxes are very much lighter than his own. He knows that our railroad facilities are far greater than most Dakotans enjoy, and that our freight rates are not higher than he pays. He knows that in this country men do not live in daily terror of their lives from the devouring blizzard and the annihilating cyclone; and his eyes are turning this way. 

With the European populations the case is quite other. No sooner have they read a just account of the country than some damning "resolution," Winnipeg tempest or Silcoxian deliverance meets their eye and spoils all. When its own people paint it black, will strangers and foreigners in distant lands think the country white? They will take it at its own word and give it a wide berth. Capital will do the same. Can the blindness of party or selfishness go further? But Mr. Silcox says this is not the trouble. Hear him: "The whole management of the Northwest country would have to be much altered before that region would prosper." That's it. You see it is not the immigration frighteners or the capital deterers at all, but "bad management," that is, "bad Government," which, being interpreted, means a Conservative Government. Ah! there's the rub. There can be no prosperity here so long as Sir John Macdonald rules yonder. God's noble endowment of this land goes for nothing so long as those Jones sit on the treasury benches. The Hamans still cry, "All this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai, the Jew, sitting at the king's gate." Well, Mordecai has been sitting there some time; let us hope that some of the Hamans may be hanged. Terrible spirit of party, here stalking hand in hand with the besoured spirit of the boom, hast thou come hither also to wither and to waste? Some of us here, however, choose to think that this country has been managed as well as a somewhat unmanageable country could be managed; and treated pretty fairly on the whole. The country has been opened up at vast expense, but not at our expense. The land laws are more favorable to the genuine homesteader than are those of the neighboring states. For so young a country our railway and postal facilities are remarkably good. Very substantial and comprehensive have been the favors showered on us by the central government, and I fail to see where the evil treatment or the bad "management" comes in. True, we have asked some things which we have not yet received; for example, permission to break faith with the syndicate in the name of the Dominion and in the interest of a foreign nation; permission to paralyze an enterprise in which the very life-blood of Canada pulsates, and which has made us what we are: permission to enrich a few Winnipeg traders at the expense of the whole nation; in one word, permission to stab that nation to the heart. This refusal is of course a part of the bad "management." It is ever the way with spoiled children. They can't understand the "governor's" disallowance of powder and shot. Sectional selfishness is at the bottom of our imaginary woes, and radical indeed will be the "change" that will save us from ourselves. It is hard to save a man bent on self-destruction. Of course, I am willing to believe that some change of treatment may be desirable, something to let the wind off the poor old woman's stomach. For real grievances, Ireland stands first; for fancied ones, Manitoba. Anything rather than obscurity. Since the day I first set foot in it, I have heard little but groans. Year in, year out, rolls on the melancholy music. Quite intolerable would it be were it not for the sudden transitions, the striking alternations in the movement; but the undertone of woe ceases never. Favors received may remove the cause; but they cannot stop the wail. Manitoba is like the old woman who found herself very thirsty as she lay tossing one night on her bed in a hotel, next door to a gentleman's bedroom, who couldn't sleep for her unceasing wail, "Ochone, but I am dry!" He arose, gave her a glass of water, and returned to his bed, fancying the trouble at an end. Not to, however, to his dismay he found that the sleep-repelling lamentation went on as vigorously as before, but varied into the retrospective: "Ochone, but I was dry!" Everything from the grasshopper to the syndicate is a source of woe. Winnipeg! in a chronic attitude of unrest and suspicion. This center of sore heads has no faith in anybody. Norquay is a deceiver. Scarth is a traitor. Sir John a tyrant. The syndicate a devouring monster, and each suspects his fellow. The notable thing is the celerity with which some intolerable grievance is dropped, though unredressed, when another looms in sight promising choicer opportunities to the agitator. Who now ever hears of the famous "Bill of Rights?" That cow ran dry. At one time it is canned fruits. At another, agricultural implements. Then the school lands iniquity. Again, the swamp lands enormity. Then a grand rush is made for Hudson's Bay. Lastly, a milted dash down the Red River valley to the haven of the oppressed. Yesterday the cry was "On to Churchill!" Today it is "On to Pembina!" The central authority is set at naught; and open rebellion once more threatened. There is in all this more energy than dignity. I suppose Mr. Silcox would call it the energy of despair; to me it seems like the energy of "A furious maniac slinging flame." The spectacle is as pitiable as it is ridiculous. We are fast becoming a laughing stock to the world. Blow after blow falls on the head of this devoted land, not from without but from within. Compared to our own, the hand of Jack Frost has been light upon us. Our cradle was rocked in rebellion. Hardly had the child left the cradle when the evil spirit of Mammon "boomed" him delirious. Slowly convalescent, the "Farmers' Union" dealt him a terrific thump. Then a second insurrection, fomented by designing men not residing in Old Canada, "plunged him fathom deep in brine; and now a third horror on the horizon, a cloud "like a man's hand," soon, I suppose, to grow "And topple round the dreary West, A looming vision fringed with fire." And all for what? A "monopoly," without which this country would still be inaccessible; echoing the bellow of the buffalo, not the hoot of the agitator: "excessive rates," never yet shown to be excessive. Beyond a certain mark Parliament interferes. It has not interfered. Why? Because, though necessarily high, they are not excessive. Does not everybody know that without the so-called "monopoly clause" no syndicate could have been found; no road built; no Winnipeg created; no theatre erected wherein to strut and pose? As if we only discovered the existence of such a clause after our arrival here! As if we did not know long before how it must tend to pinch us! As if this very pinching had not been very cho...

Erfully contracted for by us, to escape the keener life-long pinching that threatened us on the declining or unattainable homesteads of the West. Incredible that honorable men should threaten rebellion unless their rulers deliberately perpetrate a deed of dishonor and downright cruelty that would consign the name of Canada to eternal infamy, not to mention its traitorous unpatriotism. For, what is it these men ask? Simply that the nation turn thief in the first place, reverse its whole policy in the second place, and, in the third, cut the hoop that holds the staves together, that our very life-blood should flow out to our neighbors if only Winnipeg might sip a cup or two extra as it passed. Of course, the Government simply scouts the monstrous idea; ergo, say Silcox and Co, "the whole management must be changed! The misrulers of Canada, who, nevertheless, prefer building her up to benefiting the States, and who think 'a bargain's a bargain's a bargain,' must make way for men who would betray her interests and make 'ducks and drakes' of her obligations." The world is asked to believe that the Canadian Pacific Railway is deliberately crushing the people here, as if the very idiot could not see that not even ourselves have a greater interest in our prosperity than that company. No man or class of men has any such interest in the development of the Northwest. To accuse it of laying crushing burdens on the people, therefore, is simply to charge it with designs on its own life. In other words, that the syndicate consists either of suicidally inclined maniacs or of financial dunderheads. I shall not believe that they wish their own great enterprise to fail, or that the wisdom of Winnipeg would contribute much to its success. Possibly Sir George H. C. might know as much about railroading as do even the firm of Silcox & Co. Our welfare is theirs. This is our guarantee, and it ends the controversy. There is no alternative. You must either believe that the company has the welfare of Manitoba at heart or that it has taken leave of its senses. Mark the significantly tender style in which Mr.

18871031: 0 OVER HEDGES AND DITCHES A Cross Country Record Beaten in a Blizzard. The Montreal McGill Beaten in the final Inter-Provincial Rugby Championship—Gent Beat Hutchins Football in the States. Sporting in General. L. Maltby was referee. "What a day for a cross country race," said someone, as he peered as far ahead as the driving snow would let him, and looked at the expanse of dreary white, with the shadowy outlines of leafless trees appearing through the blizzard. Look at those fellows with no clothes on worth mentioning and legs bare; and then turn up your coat collar, pull up the buffalo robe and enjoy a comfortable shiver while waiting for the start. It would be interesting to know what athletic association, outside Montreal, could turn out sixteen young men in weather like Saturday to travel over hedges and ditches, up hill and down dale, with visions of barbed wire and stone walls, and the weather man doing the best he knew how to make business brisk for the doctors. That's the kind of stuff our athletes are made of, and the weather does not count when there is a trophy waiting at the end of the journey. Not a minute is lost in starting; overcoats are off; a weird sort of aboriginal dance is indulged in to an accompaniment of dental chattering; watches are taken out; "Go!" and they are off. Inside of a hundred yards the pack is in Indian file, Johnson volunteering to show the way, with Moffatt, Ross, Gordon, and Lamb on each other's heels, and the rest following the leaders closely. Then the cut across the field is made. "We'll have to drive pretty hard to catch them at the corner." "Oh, no; the weather is too bad; they can't do it today." Inside 45. "Getting up through Fletcher's field the string had broken in two. Johnson, Moffatt, Lamb, Starke, Barnard, Gordon, and Baillie were the first division and Paton was heading the second part of the pack. Findlay, who was not in the best of trim and only went in to make up a team, had dropped away behind and it was thought he would turn back, but he did not. The Back River course is, perhaps, as good a course as any for those interested enough to follow the race with the aid of a horse or two. There are half a dozen places where a good view can be had from the road. The old heads that know every foot of the road were pretty good guides as to where to stand up in a wagon and take a view. Passing a copse a halt was made; "There's a good opening; we'll stop till they pass." "What are you stopping for? They're away ahead!" and so they were. The first six were hanging on to each other like leeches. "What time they were making! And such a day! They'll beat last Saturday's run if they keep at it." There's a brush; Ross and Johnson are running side by side; Ross is leading; Moffatt is close up; the three leaders are drawing away from the rest of the field; another see-saw; Johnson is showing the way again; Moffatt keeps his distance; it looks as if he were letting the leaders tire themselves see-sawing; but he never lets them get far away. The continual change of places between Johnson and Ross had made the pace a corker. Moffatt is contented with third place so far, and does not care about spurting. The field is gradually being left behind and Lamb makes a great effort to catch up to the company that is leading the way. "Now drive like the wind or we'll miss them at Bougie's corner." The corner is just reached in time. Down the lane they come; Ross is leading; crossing the road there is a brush; a bound over the ditch and Johnson tops the stone wall lift; Ross is not a second behind him; over goes Moffatt; and Lamb appears at the head of the lane. The way the four got over that wall was a sight to see. They looked as fresh as if they had just started, and there was no such thing as being pumped. The rest of the men were invisible, and to be in at the finish a hard drive was necessary for spectators and timekeepers. "Now, catch them coming out of that copse!" They are in just the same order as they were when they got over the wall. Lamb is a little further behind. Johnson is easily distinguishable at a distance by his tuque; Ross is in black and Moffatt wears the club uniform. Ross and Johnson have another little contest to show the way. Moffatt is unshakable; he just stays where he is. "What are they running so fast for now? They'll be pumped out." The outsider did not know the true inwardness of that little burst of speed. Visions of a brindle bulldog give great impetus to a steeple chase, especially when he remembers his nether covering is not extensive. By the way, when a farmer sees a young man cut across the corner of his lot in racing rig, he might know that his chicken coop is not threatened, and when the snow is on the ground there is not much danger of injuring the crops by running over his field. One farmer, with no soul for athletics and a stickler for trespassing regulations, tried the efficacy of a broom handle and then retired hurriedly to the house. This was the time the runner's mind was occupied with bulldog and how fast bulldogs usually travel across country. The canine, however, did not make his appearance and the splendid work of the day is not dimmed by hydrophobic apprehensions, but the visionary canine helped to make the pace just the same. At the last point of vantage on the road the timekeepers named the first four positions correctly. This was where Moffatt began to take a hand in earnest. The pace was a rattling one, and Johnson was making it. Moffatt's spurting; so he was. He's passing Ross; he passed him, but he could go no higher; Johnson had too much speed. It will be a hot finish. Ross is slowly dropping behind. The pace is terrible. At last Peloquin's is reached and just as the timekeepers vault the fence Johnson dashes up. "Make way," say the judges; "Thirty-seven ten," cry the timekeepers. "There goes the record," said one of the judges. "Moffatt, thirty-seven twenty." Two men knock the record endways. Then Ross comes up and vaults the fence without touching. "37.50." "It's a good thing that Toronto team did not come along; we'd have had to send out a search party or they'd have got lost in the snow," was another remark. Every man of the team had some word of encouragement as he reached the goal. There was a sprinting finish between Gordon and Barnard, there being only a second between them, and Weldon and Foster had a pretty close run of it. The following is the order of arrival with the time made and the points, the lowest score to count: 

1. Johnson 37:10 
2. Moffatt 37:20 
3. Ross 37:50 
4. Lamb 38:00 
5. Gordon 38:10 
6. Starke 39:16

THREE HOURS IN SESSION Another Meeting of the Fishery Negotiators. A MONOPOLY IN DANGER—Another Cut in Eastbound Freight Rates. A Coal Famine Feared in the West. Washington, November 28. The fishery negotiators met at noon today at the Department of State. The English representatives took with them a number of official documents. Among the publications on the subject of the fisheries that have recently come into the possession of the American negotiators is the Canadian book of dispatches, containing correspondence between the Canadian and English Governments, which was to a certain extent unknown to the Department of State, and is expected to prove of value in the pending negotiations. The session lasted until 3 o'clock, when an adjournment was had until Wednesday next. 

The Latest from New York, November 23. There is yet no settlement of the fight between the trunk line pool and the Grand Trunk line over the rates on dressed meats and live stock. Commissioner Kink today announced another reduction in rates to meet the Grand Trunk's last cut. 

Chicago, November 28. The Chicago and Grand Trunk opened the week today with another reduction in the dressed meat rates, bringing them down to 34 cents a hundred pounds from Chicago to Boston and New England points. There is an impression among the majority of railway officials here that the fiercest of the fight is over and that rates will not go much lower. 

A Coal Famine Feared. Chicago, November 28. The announcement comes from Duluth that nearly 1,000,000 tons of coal have been taken there, over 200,000 more than last year, and yet it is already evident that there will be a great shortage in the supply this winter. The first blizzard has come and the towns of western Minnesota and Eastern Dakota are showing signs of great anxiety. At Huron many people are procuring to bring hay burners into requisition. At Adrian there is not a pound of coal for sale and some distress is reported among the poor. 

A Monopoly in Danger. Chicago, November 28. The City Council tonight, by an almost unanimous vote, adopted resolutions requesting the Mayor to write the Attorney-General of the state asking him to file a warrant for the purpose of forfeiting the charter of the Chicago Gas Trust. The forfeiture of the charter of every gas company in the city was also demanded, each of them being now controlled by the trust.

CANADA AND HER COUSIN
Study of American Life and American Institutions
ANNEXATION TO BE SHUNNED, Material Prosperity Not the Only Basis of Usual Greatness

Canada Fears the Tyranny of Neither Mob Nor Monarch
Evidences of Decay in the Republic

(Written for the Gazette) The people of Canada are a unit in their readiness for a renewal of reciprocal trade relations with the United States whensoever it may please the latter to evince a similar disposition; not so, however, with regard to commercial union, which, for Canada, would mean commercial vassalage first, then political annexation. I am one of those who deprecate the periodic discussion of "the future of Canada" by Canadians; the very raising of the question implies distrust in that future. Is there not a lack of dignity in these intermittent speculations concerning the success of the Dominion, a thing which it were both more muscular and more patriotic to take for granted? These timorous misgivings tend powerfully to precipitate the very catastrophe they prophetically deplore. I heartily wish the question had never been raised; now that it has been raised once more, in shrieking notes, nothing remains but to grapple with it.

Opinion is divided. The vast majority of Canadians would HOLD CANADA TO HER PRESENT HOLDINGS. Realizing her strong position as a wing of the British Empire, grateful for the maternal care and proud of the old flag, their faces are set against secession; their dream is of a steady march to greatness in monarchical solidity on this otherwise unsteady continent. A small minority have visions of independence, independence in the indefinite future, whilst a fragment of the population either longs for annexation, or, with that fierce opponent of "dismemberment," where Ireland is concerned, Mr. Goldwin Smith, at least regard it as the "ultimate destiny" of Canada. Of course, every annexationist is a hot apostle of "commercial union"; I do not say that every advocate of this is an annexationist (consciously). The Monroe Doctrine has not yet quite faded out of Brother Jonathan's inner consciousness. Deep down in his soul still links the complacent conviction that the wings of the great eagle ought to flap over the entire continent. Bellicose extension of these pinions he no longer contemplates; the idea of forcible absorption has made way for that of natural gravitation. For years his policy has been to let Canada severely alone till her desolate isolation should open her eyes to her true interests, till "ultimate destiny," natural selection-like, should "differentiate" her into his embraces. He was mistaken; she still kept sidling off. He cut off reciprocity; the shock would bring her to her senses. Her response is confederation, national policy, Canadian Pacific Railway. Was the fishery aggression (connived in the interest of the same idea)? No matter. These annexationist blunders in self-reliance have been a grand thing for our country, even though they have cast back her "ultimate destiny," making it more sickeningly ultimate than ever it was before. Canada has always shown a neighborly spirit towards the republic, though asserting her rights when assailed with firmness, calmness, and dignity. Perhaps she has evinced too eager a solicitude for more intimate trade relations with her nearest neighbor. Farther than this she cannot go. The latest, the master snare laid for her, is commercial union. "In vain is the net set in the sight of any bird."

The next general election will give this project a great no. Such is my firm belief. And yet the insane idea seems to be spreading somewhat. It has bewitched the man of one standpoint, whose eye is so dazzled with the temple that his ear hears not the moans of the victim on the altar. The American orator has flashed its fascination in our eyes. A few prominent Canadians are amongst its apostles; and a section of the press contends strenuously for the cause. And what does it all mean? It means that five million people shall put themselves in the power of sixty million! It means national humiliation, the admission of failure in the midst of success, a detestable sycophancy, the posture of the mendicant! It means that Ottawa shall take her orders from Washington, and send the shells hiding through London! That a foreign power shall dictate to England's daughter how she shall behave towards her own mother! It means democracy with its evils, from Florida to the Pole, the burial of our highest hopes in the tomb of Monarchy on this continent! And all for what? For a few very problematical intertrade advantages! Is this not madness? The native-born Canadian without a country; what he once fondly called his country, in the dust, betrayed, conquered! How many will vote for this? Again, THE AGITATION IS CAUSELESS. Canada is prosperous. It is an unpatriotic movement, giving the country away in more senses than one. It is an unfortunate occurrence when the Dominion has just gathered herself together and girded her loins for high endeavor. Such is the moment chosen to turn her eyes elsewhere; to seduce her from her noble purpose of self-development; to persuade her she is ill, and should call in Dr. Jonathan; to invite her to surrender much of what she holds most dear for the doubtful advantage of an alliance with a neighbor, whose would be the gain and the glory, hers the disappointment and the shame. And for even this she is expected to stand as a suppliant at the door of the White House! The Republic affects a sublime indifference. She has grand things to give us, but we must receive them hat in hand. But suppose our material interests will be promoted by commercial union or annexation (which I deny), does it follow that such union is desirable? It has been said that "real prosperity is the coveted destiny of a nation." True; but what constitutes "real" prosperity? If this is to be measured by material standards alone, who can deny it to the Republic? Her march to material greatness has been marvelous, much swifter than it would have been under monarchical rule. So far, so good. But here two questions arise which must admit of an affirmative answer, or this material prosperity falls far short of "real prosperity," and shrivels to insignificance: (1) Will it endure? (2) Is it sufficient while it lasts? Only one of the factors of "real prosperity," though important, it is not the chief. Of far profounder significance are those of A MORAL AND POLITICAL COMPLEXION, on the soundness of which depends the permanence of material grandeur itself. Rome was once the synonym for this species of greatness: wealth, luxury, expansion, intellectual vigor, empire; she fell, for her heart was corrupt. The story of all defunct empires is told in a phrase: material greatness, undermined by moral rottenness; civilization of the intellect without civilization of the heart. On this mine sits the Republic. One of her own writers pictures her as "the most corrupt, and, perhaps, the least cultured of the civilized nations." Terrible indictment of democratic tendencies! For this nation is still a child in years. She is not an upgrowth from the deeper depths of humanity as most other nations have been, rising on stepping stones of their dead selves to higher things. She did not, as did her mother, merge by a slow evolution from barbarism to civilization. No! She started in intelligence and integrity on a level with the highest. If fallen from this high estate, what has caused the decline? No barbarous vandal has swooped on her to fling back her civilization. The germs of moral decay are in her constitution. Already is her beauty marred with furrows deep and ineffaceable. A few years ago another American wrote a book entitled "Are we a Nation of Rascals?" in view of the wholesale State repudiations. More than a dozen States had got rid of their debt, to the tune of hundreds of millions, by simply declining to pay! Nor has there been the faintest indication of any national indignation or sense of shame at the nefarious procedure! Is this a symptom of vigorous moral health? Or does it tell of deep-seated disease? Does Canada aspire to be a sharer in this infamy? Of course, all honorable Americans—and they are counted by millions—deplore the existence of facts such as these; but they are powerless to prevent their recurrence. This is the terrible consideration. Herein lies the darkest count against a pure democracy: it smothers its best children. The higher and nobler the class of citizen, the weaker its voice in the affairs of the nation. In the roar of the mob every finer voice is drowned. Is it not notorious that in most of the cities civic robbery is expected as the regulation thing; and endured as inevitable with all the muteness of despair? Does a system of government which both tolerates and engenders such a state of things hold a long lease of life? Manhood suffrage is a sufficient guarantee for the longevity of the evil; but who gives security for that of the nation? Plainly, I have little faith in the final success of this republican experiment; it is beset with perils.

THE AGENCIES OF DECAY ARE AT WORK already. This form of government is favorable to a very flexible expansion and swift development; the oak of permanent empire is of slow growth. A dominant idea in the world today is expressed in the phrase "triumphant democracy." That America has finally and favorably solved and settled the problem of republicanism is taken for granted, and the hallucination has rolled like a tide over the nations, shaking every throne. Most powerfully has it aided that social and political unrest in Europe which threatens extinction to the very name of monarchy. Yet it is merely a chronological mistake. One century of national existence, though attended with the greatest material prosperity, is too short a test. In my opinion, the Republic is only just entering on the gravest portion of its trial. Let us indicate some of its perils. Money is worshipped. In a commonwealth that bestows no titles as a recognition of literary, professional, military, or other merit, what avenue to distinction is left save the accumulation of wealth? The late Dr. Draper, himself an American, treating of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, significantly remarks that when wealth comes to be the only mark of social distinction, national collapse is not far to seek. The cant of the day sneers at titles; yet the ambition thus crowned may be noble and elevating; the scramble for sufficient money to constitute distinction must be debasing or worse. The demon of greed is abroad, blasting all he touches and making the fevered life scarce worth living. If the "love of money be the root of all evil," its giant adoration as a good must leave small room for good. Manhood suffrage is fulfilling its mission in controlling and corrupting everything; paralyzing law, fattening the demagogue, and stifling the best citizenship. Lynch law, known only in the States, still flourishes, proclaiming its verdict on the efficiency of the courts. How comes it to pass that Judge Lynch cannot breathe the air of Canada, even in her wild western regions? Then, in the Western states and territories, if a man steals a horse, he is sure of lynching; if he shoots down a man, little is thought about it! Probably Mormonism might still flourish in its abominations, unchecked and unchided, had it not threatened to control, over a vast region, the sacred ballot box. Yes, this precious toy, the center and symbol of all human interest, is never out of sight. Year in, year out, the great electoral cauldron boils away; quadrennially boiling over, with its unpleasant fumes. The very air is heavy with politics. To see the names of "candidates" growing in the leaves of the forest would scarce surprise one. There are two things in this Republic: a wild race for money and a blizzard of politics that never blows quite over. What a wretched ideal of the purpose of life!

ANOTHER CHRONIC FEATURE OF SOCIETY is the insubordination of youth, the feebleness of parental authority. Nor does the prevalent ante-natal infanticide tend to establish the nation. Nor the widespread infidelity. Nor the general admiration for "smart." Here is the corrected text:

Villainy, villainy! What is it that draws thither, as to a congenial rendezvous, the outcasts of the nation? The thinness of the line between liberty and license attracts most of these. Convicted of fiendish crimes, they may be led to the scaffold; but it is with a hesitating step and a trembling hand, two to one of the population deprecating their righteous punishment. Are these symptoms of health? No! The Republic is sick. The Negro question is not settled. Emancipation did but open it. Between black and white "there is a deep gulf fixed," and it can never be bridged. In the poor negro's case, education is the avenue to pain. Increase of intelligence means, in his case, higher pretensions and the bitterer disappointment; socially ostracized, even religion hesitates to recognize him as a man! Is there no germ of national peril in this dehumanization of nine million people? Is there no tempest gathering in the black South? The counts in this indictment are dark and damaging. But suppose I let all the preceding go for nothing; two charges remain which, of themselves alone, furnish a CONCLUSIVE ARGUMENT AGAINST ANNEXATION, and therefore against commercial union. The first is the fearful state of the laws relating to marriage and divorce. Remember, we are criticizing a Christian nation, not a district of savagedom. The founder of Christianity allowed but one justification of divorce, all who break this rule being simply adulterers. In the States, any trifling cause is sufficient. Hence, the country abounds in "ladies" of many husbands, and men of many wives. In Chicago alone, the number of applications for divorce each year is about 6,000, most of them successful. Marriage, divested of all its sacredness and solemnity, degraded to the level of a mere civil contract, and "solemnized" by the village blacksmith; marriage, divorced from religion, nods its fitting denouement in the divorce of the married. This disgraceful trifling with marriage is highly immoral and unwise. Marriage makes the family; that is, the foundation stone of the State. If the pillar on which society rests is unsound, some...

Toronto, Ont., December 21, 1 a.m. A depression, which is now over the Lake district and has moved quickly northeastward from the southwestern States, is causing light snow in Ontario and strong winds in Quebec and the Maritime provinces. The pressure is increasing with fair colder weather. It continues fine and very cold with extremely high pressure in the northwest. St. Lawrence increasing east and northeast winds; partly cloudy to cloudy weather with snow; not much change in temperature. A REGULAR BLIZZARD IN THE WEST. St. Paul, December 20. The first genuine blizzard of the season has been raging in Dakota all day. A storm of snow as fine as sand, driven by a fierce wind, and accompanied by very low temperatures prevails at Assiniboine, the thermometer indicating 28 below at 5 o'clock this evening. Wichita, Ky., December 20. A blizzard is prevailing and is general over the west. It is thought it has caught the country without an adequate supply of coal. Great suffering and distress are feared. 

18871231: COMMERCIAL UNION. Senator Macdonald's Speech Before the Merchants' Association. Canada Will Not Discriminate Against Great Britain. Objections to the Project. The following is a report of Hon. Senator Macdonald's speech at the Boston banquet: Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Merchants' Association, allow me to say that I esteem it no small honor to be present at this banquet, to exchange with you friendly greetings and to express by the living voice those sentiments of amity and goodwill of which the flags of both nations, wherever they are seen, are the symbols. (Applause.) I am not here, Mr. President, to combat anything that I may have heard with which I do not agree. I am here to give expression to my own sentiments. I am not here as the representative of anybody or any set of men. And I sincerely trust that I shall not give utterance to a single sentiment which I shall not have the satisfaction of knowing is endorsed by the assembly. In the first place, then, I hold it to be the duty of both nations to adopt and to encourage and to perpetuate the largest possible measure of goodwill and reciprocity compatible with existing rights and with national obligations. Now, it may be asked, what do I mean by existing rights? I am not going to talk about free trade. I am not going to talk about a revenue tariff. I have my own opinion upon these subjects, but I am not going to obtrude them here. But upon the question of protection, I may say this: That it is not right to sweep away suddenly by legislative enactment industries that have been fostered and called into life by legislative action. (Great applause.) I may venture further to say, and I am sure I shall not hurt anybody's feelings, because it does not interfere with the matter of protection itself, that overprotecting industries is never a blessing. I am not going to talk about the fisheries. I have an interest in them and you have an interest in them, but they more immediately belong to the Maritime provinces than to us in the West, and it would be unmanly in me, unpatriotic in me, to want to make a bargain for ourselves by making the fisheries in the Maritime provinces an offset. But I am going to say this: whatever the worth of the fisheries may be, though their waters may teem with wealth that is illimitable, the fishes have to be caught and they have to be sold before they yield a profit, and they have to find a profitable market, and the larger the market and the more abundant the market, the better for the fishermen. (Applause.) I take it for granted that the gentlemen appointed to deal with this matter are worthy of confidence. They will doubtless consider precedents. They will doubtless take up the act. I will simply say this: I would refer them to one precedent. There is a book in which everything noble and lofty and heroic and unselfish is to be found. That book contains everything to guide the individual, the family, and the state. I can give them a parallel case, perhaps the closest parallel that can be found in the whole range of history. It is the story of an old man and his nephew. By the very force of circumstances, their herdsmen had begun to rub uncomfortably against one another. There arose a big strife. How was it cured? It was cured by the unselfish and noble conduct of the old man, who said: "Let there be no strife between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen, for we be brethren." I should change the figure a little and personify the nations. In that case, it was a question of boundaries, and in this case, it is a question of the three-mile limit. And I would say: "Let there be no strife between thee and me and between my fishermen and thy fishermen, for we are brethren." (Great applause.) I have spoken to you in regard to national obligations. Perhaps you will ask me what I mean by national obligations. I understand, for example, that commercial union means discrimination against Great Britain. In my former remarks, I said, "the widest possible measure of unrestricted reciprocity compatible with existing interests and national obligations." What do I mean by national obligations? I will tell you. I stood today in one of the noblest buildings that is in the possession of any nation. I stood today in Memorial Hall; and from the walls, I saw looking down upon me the handsome faces of young men who gave their lives for their country. I went into the hall, and I saw that the building was erected in memory of the brave young men who fell to perpetuate liberty. That is what I understand to be national obligation, from your standpoint; and when all the records of the corporations that have come into existence, and all their wealth shall have perished, the history of these heroic men will remain and will be handed down to your children as a heritage of which your children will be proud. You ask me what do I mean by national obligation to Canada? Why, I simply mean this: That while there is a desire for the largest measure of reciprocity with you, I tell you that no system that points to discrimination against Great Britain will ever succeed. You cannot expect, when you do all that you have done for union, that there is no union sentiment with us. You cannot expect that you will do everything to serve the best interests of your nation and that we will not guard against anything that would let in the wedge ever so slightly that might ultimately lead to a separation from the mother country. Let me tell you that the Board of Trade in Toronto occupies the very same position that you occupy here. Let me tell you what their position is upon this great question as expressed in a series of resolutions adopted by them: "We disapprove of any proposal to discriminate against Great Britain, whose protection we enjoy and under whose fostering care we have grown to the enviable position that we now occupy among the people of the world."

INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION. The Disaster that Would Attend a Policy of Non-intercourse (St. Paul Pioneer Press). The Kansas City Times dealt quite as sharply as did the Pioneer Press with the plea of Mr. Joseph Nimmo, Jr., for protection to American railroads at the expense of the American shipper. The criticisms that have been made upon the argument of the question in these columns ignore, precisely as Mr. Nimmo does, the fundamental fact that the interests of the shippers of this country are superior to the interests of the transcontinental roads. It is, of course, apparent that the competition of the Canadian Pacific is one hard to meet, because of the heavy money subsidies made to that road by the Dominion Government. But there are some other facts that appear to be forgotten. What are the circumstances on this side? The first transcontinental roads in this country were subsidized as heavily by guarantees of the people of the United States. If they had taken that assistance honestly, if they had run their roads for the benefit of the public, if they had applied their profits to the extinguishment of obligations, if no dollar of earnings had been misapplied or privately appropriated, those early roads would be in a position today to laugh at the efforts of the Canadian Pacific, or any other line, to compete with them. What was their first competitor? The Northern Pacific, a road which did not receive a dollar of public money directly, but was aided only by a liberal land grant. It might have been argued quite as reasonably that the Northern Pacific could not compete for trade with the Union and Central Pacific, and that shippers should be prohibited from sending their freight over the latter line until the roads had gotten upon their legs. The fact shows that the Northern Pacific was abundantly able to take care of itself. Looking a little farther, we discover another line, built from St. Paul to Helena, and thus coming into the field for a share of the business. It has been built wholly by private capital, without either money subsidy or public land grant. Yet we hear nothing of a proposal to Congress to pass a law prohibiting the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba from carrying through freights to Helena, except at such rates as the Northern Pacific may prescribe, nor any desire on the part of either competitor for anything but a fair race for business. As to the shipper, we need not ask him what he would think of any regulation or device that prevented him from getting the benefit of the lowest rates afforded by competition. As we have already seen, the transcontinental roads have already reached an agreement, including the Canadian Pacific, which not only enables them to maintain rates, but to buy off the Pacific Mail for an immense monthly subsidy. And they are fully protected against the effects of Canadian cut rates by the ruling of the interstate commission, permitting them, in such case, to charge higher rates for the short haul than for the long. They are getting along all right. It is the "forgotten man," the shipper of freight, who gets out of the situation what benefit there is in it. It is he who would suffer by a policy of non-intercourse that would include not only...

18880113: IOASA VT DAY With Decided Mixture of Weather Promised It Toronto, Ont., January 13, 1888, 1 a.m. Since last night the high pressure has moved eastward to the Lower St. Lawrence valley and the New England states, and the storm which was over the Northwest territories has moved toward the Lake region. The weather has continued fair and cold in eastern Canada, while in Ontario the temperature has been rising with strong easterly winds. A northwesterly blizzard has prevailed throughout our Northwest territories. Upper St. Lawrence: Strong winds and gales from southeast and southwest; milder cloudy weather with snow, turning to sleet or rain, followed this evening or tonight by west to northwest winds and decidedly colder weather. A TERRIBLE BLIZZARD Osakis, Wis., January 12. A blizzard set in about 3 o'clock this afternoon and threatens to seriously interfere with the railroads. At Muscatine, IA, the worst blizzard of the season is raging, and at Sioux City, IA, the same report is made. No trains are arriving at or leaving the latter place. St. Paul, Minn., January 12. The worst snow and wind storm of the season prevailed in the Northwest today. Railroad travel is badly crippled. At Huron, Dak., the wind is blowing fifty miles an hour. The air is so full of snow that one is unable to see fifty feet at any time. Some unthinking teachers dismissed young school children, some of whom have to go four or five blocks across the open land. Five or six children got lost. Whistles are blowing, bells are ringing, and people turned out and took long ropes and walked fifteen or twenty abreast back and forth over the ground. They have just found two; the other not yet having been discovered. The mercury is 4 below zero, and has fallen 28 degrees since 10 o'clock. In St. Paul, the parade and other ceremonies attending the laying of the cornerstone of the third Ice Palace were postponed to Saturday. Winnipeg, January 12. This has been the stormiest day of the season, a terrible blizzard raging, and railway travel is greatly impeded.

"I don't understand you." "You asked me to be so kind as to lend you $5." "Yes." "If you had been candid, you would have said to me: 'Be so stupid, be so ignominious an ass, such a hopeless idiot, as to lend me $5,' and you ought to have got it." 

The Lieutenant-Governor's Speech: The Harrison Government Not Attacked in the House, But Receives a Bad Blow by Bye-Election. Winnipeg, January 12. There was a more than usually large crowd at the opening of the legislature today, notwithstanding that a severe blizzard was raging. Lieutenant-Governor Aikens read the following speech from the throne: "I have much pleasure in meeting you at the opening of the second session of the sixth Legislature of the province of Manitoba. I have to congratulate you on the abundant harvest of the past season, which has far exceeded the expectations of the agriculturists of the province. Returns so far made to the Department of Agriculture show that the total yield of wheat alone throughout the Province will exceed 12,000,000 bushels of excellent quality, besides large returns of other cereals. This result must prove very beneficial to all classes in the community and is a cause of gratitude to the Giver of all good, for so many blessings bestowed on the labors of the husbandman. During the past year, vigorous efforts have been made to bring to the notice of the agricultural classes of the eastern provinces and the older markets, the various advantages Manitoba offers to industrious tillers of the soil, and it is pleasing to know that the result has been to induce large numbers to look in this direction for future homes."

A NOTED SWINDLER Of Worldwide Reputation Arrested in New York for a Fraud in Mexico. New York, January 13. Henry Benson was arrested today, charged with swindling citizens of the City of Mexico in 1886 by selling to them $26,000 worth of tickets to a bogus series of operatic performances to be given by Adelina Patti under the management of Henry E. Abbey. Benson represented himself as Abbey's agent. The Mexican authorities have been notified and will begin extradition proceedings. The prisoner has a remarkable record, having successfully carried on his nefarious work in many of the European capitals. He swindled the Lord Mayor of London out of $5,000 on the pretense that he was collecting money for the suffering Parisians during the siege of Paris. For this, he was imprisoned for one year, but upon being released, went into partnership with one Kerr and conducted a swindling publication, which pretended to give "tips" on sporting events. Finally, the Countess De Jonchult, of a French province, who had lost $55,000 through the rascals, offered a reward for their conviction. They were apprehended, convicted, and received sentences of fifteen years each. Finding life too uncomfortable over the water, Benson emigrated to this country, where he has carried on a successful business on the line. Philadelphia has a parrot that prays: "Send him as a missionary among the countless profane and fallen of his kind."

BLIZZARD-STRICKEN STATES: Terrible Storm in the American Northwest. Many Persons Frozen to Death and Railway Travel Completely Stopped West of St. Paul. Lunger's War Against Monopoly. St. Paul, January 13. Yesterday's storm was without exception the worst that has ever been experienced in the Northwest. Snow to the depth of two feet on the level and from five to fifteen feet in the cuts was sufficient to almost suspend the running of trains. But added to this, the severe wind which blew in some parts, and the blizzard which raged in others, has suspended railway business entirely. Freight trains were hung up early yesterday, not a wheel moving after noon. Passenger trains, one by one, followed suit, and by eight o'clock last night, there was no attempt at running a train at any point west of St. Paul. The eastern lines, however, tried hard to keep their tracks open, but without success. At six o'clock this morning, reports from various points along the several roads were discouraging, and it was almost decided to abandon everything. With snow plows and engines, trains were sent out and are now stuck on some hill and lying idle at some station along the lines. The Northern Pacific and the Manitoba & Milwaukee, on its Minnesota & Dakota division, made no attempt to start and will not do so until there is at least a possibility of their getting through. Branch line trains were all at junctional points last night; there is no prediction when they will be opened. It is thought that some of them will be closed for six weeks. And on top of this condition of things, it is feared the worst is to come. The wind is blowing hard on all the lines today, and the cuts are being filled in as fast as they are cleared out. The storm of yesterday is now raging in Iowa. Besides that, another storm, or the continuation of the present one, is expected to strike Minnesota on Sunday, in which case there is no telling what the result will be. It is raging in Idaho today, and the thermometer at various points along the Northern Pacific is as low as 10 degrees below zero. The Manitoba railway reports a cold wave with high wind coming from that direction. In fact, things look so dubious today that railway men will not venture an opinion when traffic will again be resumed. Each line is putting forth every effort to keep its Chicago communication open, but even this is almost an impossibility. At noon today, not a train had come in, the Omaha limited being reported nearer than any other one. With the exception of suburban trains and the Sioux City express over the Omaha, which came in at 2 a.m., seven hours late, not a train has come into St. Paul since last night. All the trains, however, are at points where the passengers can well be cared for. All the trains over the western divisions have been abandoned; and no efforts will be made to clear the track until the storm ceases and the wind calms. The storm is severe all through Montana, Dakota, and Minnesota. A Duluth special reports that yesterday afternoon's storm...

18880116: BRITISH MERCHANT SHIPPING. That Britannia rules the waves to a greater extent than ever before in her history is made abundantly evident from an interesting comparison of Great Britain's merchant shipping with that of other nations and the relative increase of tonnage instituted by the London Times. The shipping trade of England has now become her most important material interest, the receipts from this source being estimated at fifty million sterling, or more than the total net receipts from her railways, considerably more than the gross annual value of her coal output, and almost as much as the present agricultural rent of the United Kingdom. The growth of England's merchant shipping has been an almost uninterrupted one, despite the commercial depression existing at times in the principal trading countries. In the period between 1877 and 1886, the tonnage on the British register, both steam and sail, increased from 6,330,000 tons to 7,321,000 tons, the steam tonnage in the interval nearly doubling, the increase being from 2,000,000 tons to 3,969,000 tons. The growth of steam tonnage has been very rapid. In 1800, the amount on the register was 452,352 tons, and a quarter of a century later it had risen to 3,000,728 tons, representing an increase of 10,500,000 tons of sailing tonnage, assuming one ton of steam to be equivalent to three tons of sail. The increase of steam tonnage alone in the last five years has been equal to the total tonnage on the register in 1850, and the increase was not one of mere tonnage, but of greatly augmented tonnage as well, for in every direction there has been economy introduced, in the number of hands employed to navigate a given tonnage, in facilities for loading and unloading, and in the consumption of power generally for the attainment of a specific result. Concurrently with the growth of steam tonnage, a decline in that of sail has occurred. Down to 1870, the sail tonnage on the British register augmented, reaching in that year 4,500,318 tons; then a decline set in and at the close of 1886, the sail tonnage amounted to only 3,359,589 tons. How rapid has been the substitution of steam for sail may be learned by the following statement of relative tonnage: 

Total Per cent. tonnage 
Sail 
1840 3,724,107 2,636,688 71 
1880 4,688,742 4,134,490 90 
1888 7,321,335 3,359,689 48 

It is a noteworthy fact, however, that during the last two years, the new tonnage added to the British register has been divided almost equally between steam and sailing vessels, the former amounting to 347,000 tons, and the latter to 351,000 tons. It is quite evident from this fact, concludes the Times, that in some trades sailing ships are still found to answer the purpose quite as well as steamships. They are preferred for several reasons, chiefly because they are less expensive to purchase or to build, they cost less to navigate, in respect alike of fuel economy and of the labor employed; they allow of considerably more cargo room relatively to their gross tonnage, and they are not liable to break down from accidents to machinery, etc. On the other hand, however, while progress in sailing vessels has...

Improvements in marine engines and boilers have reduced the average consumption of fuel in the best constructed ships from about 3½ or 4 lbs to less than 3 lbs per indicated horse power per hour, concurrently with the attainment of a considerably higher average speed; and not only so, but other improvements in methods of working and in the appliances used have enabled a steam vessel to be navigated with about one-half the labor employed at any rate in the foreign trade so recently as 1865. Under these circumstances, it appears to be probable that sailing tonnage will not long maintain its present relative position on the maritime registers of the principal countries of the world. The supremacy of Britain in the carrying trade of the world has been more than maintained in late years. Of nearly fifty million tons of tonnage entered and cleared at the ports of the United Kingdom in 1880, about 72 percent was British, while of fifty-four million tons of tonnage entered and cleared in 1886, no less than 75 percent was British, the increase of entrance and clearances in the six years having been not only entirely in British bottoms, but in the amount of business done in foreign bottoms there was an absolute decrease in the period. Taking the decade 1875 to 1885, we find that the total tonnage of sailing and steam ships on the registers of the principal countries of the world was in 1875, 14,281,000 tons, of which Great Britain had 6,088,000 tons, or 42.0 percent, while in 1885 the total tonnage on the registers was 10,619,000 tons, of which Great Britain had 7,387,000, or 44.4 percent. In that period, Holland alone increased her percentage more than Britain, namely from 2.8 percent to 7.7 percent; the tonnage of the United States fell off from 1,554,000 to 1,288,000 tons; that of Norway and Germany slightly increased, while that of Italy and France declined. The total steam tonnage of the principal merchant navies of the world in 1875 was 2,985,000 tons, Great Britain's share being 1,943,000, or 65 percent; and ten years later, out of a total steam tonnage of 5,931,000 tons, Great Britain had 3,970,000 tons, or 67 percent, United States steam tonnage decreasing in the decade from 192,000 tons to 186,000 tons. Another interesting test of Britain's maritime supremacy is afforded by a comparison of the tonnage of all vessels that entered and cleared in the twelve principal maritime countries of the world in 1875 and 1880. These countries appear to have had a total commerce of 143 million tons in 1875, as compared with about 210 million in 1880. The increase of tonnage that entered and cleared in the interval amounted to 67 million, of which fully 16 million, or 25 percent, of the whole, fell to the share of the United Kingdom. It is also worthy of remark that the shipping trade of the United Kingdom, as measured by the entrances and clearances of vessels, was only a little less than one-third of that of the whole of the twelve countries; that it was more than twice that of the United States, nearly four times that of Germany, more than twice that of France, nearly six times that of Italy, more than six times that of Russia, and more than three times that of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark combined. These figures, says the Times, at once demonstrate the preponderating importance of the United Kingdom as a commercial country and show that its trade with the rest of the world is very much in excess of that carried on by any other country. But what is of still greater consequence is the fact that the increase of Britain's foreign commerce is much greater than that of any other country. Between 1875 and 1880, the increase of British foreign trade was 10 million tons, while the increase in the case of the United States was only seven million, that of Germany about six million, that of France about 9 million, that of Italy 3.5 million, that of Russia less than two million, and that of Spain, due mainly to the development of her mineral resources, about 10.5 million. And the eleven chief maritime countries of the world, after Great Britain, have not only failed to keep their place in respect of the carrying of their own foreign trade, between 1875 and 1886, but have absolutely lost ground, the most remarkable case of all being that of the United States, which only carried 21.5 percent of its own foreign commerce in 1880, as compared with 31 percent in 1875. These facts conclusively establish that Britain's maritime supremacy is becoming more and more in the ascendency.

THE SIX MONTHS CLAUSE

The Ontario Court of Appeals has rendered a judgment in the Algoma election case upon the debated point whether the time of the session of Parliament should be included within the six months within which the trial of an election petition must be commenced. Section 32 of the Controverted Elections Act, which prescribes the time limit, has been variously interpreted. The New Brunswick judges unanimously, if we mistake not, and also many of the Nova Scotia judges, have held that the time of the session is to be included within the six months within which the trial must be commenced, and the majority of the Quebec judges have adopted the same view. Two judges at least, in this province, however, and several Ontario judges on circuit have held that the time of the session is not to be counted, and under this ruling have proceeded with the trial of election petitions, even though the six months limit had expired, including the time of the session within the period. The decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal coincides with the weight of judicial testimony and with the reasonable interpretation of clause 32 of the statute. That clause declares that "the trial of every election petition shall be commenced within six months from the time when such petition has been presented," and is modified by but one contingent, namely, "if at any time it appears to the court or a judge that the respondent's presence at the trial is unnecessary," then the trial is not to take place during the session of Parliament, and in determining the six months within which the trial must be commenced, the time of the session in the event of the court requiring the presence of the respondent is not to be included. It has been assumed in many cases by petitioners that the session does not count, and, acting on this assumption, they have neglected to apply for the fixing of a day for the trial within the six months; but it is obvious that the exclusion of the time of the session is a matter to be determined not by the petitioner, but by the judge, who must be satisfied that the presence of the respondent at the trial is necessary before ordering that the trial shall not take place during the session, and by virtue of that order excluding the duration of the session in the computation of the six months within which the trial must be commenced. One of the main objects of the act is despatch; the obligation to press proceedings rests on the petitioner; he is plainly instructed that the trial must take place within six months of the presentation of the petition, and failure on his part to apply for trial within this limit puts him out of court. The option of delay rests wholly with the judge; there is no option on the part of the petitioner. The Supreme Court will shortly pronounce on the point, and its opinion is likely to coincide with the Ontario Appeal Court, and the weight of judicial interpretation of a very clear section. If the Picton Liberals wanted to bring disgrace upon their party they could not have proceeded in a more businesslike manner than they have in making the liberation of the convicted bribers in the Prince Edward election case an occasion for a party demonstration. It may have been thought by many that the punishment of these people was severe. It certainly was unexpected. But no party can afford to put itself on record as sympathizing with and honoring men convicted of deliberate corruption of the electorate. The original act was criminal; the honor paid to its authors was both criminal and foolish. The powers would certainly have no slight task to discharge if they undertook to force Prince Ferdinand out of Bulgaria against the will of his subjects. Why he should be disturbed now, after being left in possession so long, and after showing by his policy and conduct that he is not unworthy of the position of ruler, it would not be easy to say. The rumor, however, appears to have been without foundation. If it were the case that the powers could be brought to unanimity on any question, there might be some hope of fruitful understanding hereafter. But it would be a bad augury if they united as one who follows a multitude (though in this case it would be the many following one) to do evil. The commercial union propaganda in this country is evidently costing someone a considerable amount of money. "Commercial union document No. 9," a twenty-page pamphlet, is being extensively circulated through the mails at present. We do not know what the exact nature of its predecessors were, or where they were spread about, but No. 9 is Mr. Wiman's speech wherein he strove to show that to increase the Canadian tariff on British goods to the United States level while the tariff on United States goods was abolished altogether was consistent with the welfare of British trade with Canada. Very appropriately, it was printed in New York, which city seems to provide both brains and literature to the Canadian wing of the movement. The blizzard that has been prevailing in the northwestern states the past three days has been terribly destructive of human life. Judging from the telegraphic reports, over fifty persons must have perished during its continuance. No such mortality as this from such a cause is, we believe, on record in America. Residents of Dakota's wind-swept plains seem to have suffered most severely, that territory being apparently peculiarly subject to these visitations. While the thermometer in the Canadian northwest has been ranging very low, the people there have had no such experience as their more southern neighbors, which fact goes to bear out the statements often made that the topographical formation of the country makes it climatically superior to the American territories. Our readers have seen in some recent articles in the Gazette that, among the most spirited, active, and successful rivals of Canada for the sale of agricultural and especially of dairy products, in Great Britain, are numbered the Kingdoms of Holland and Denmark; in the latter country, the utmost pains are taken with young men who are destined for an agricultural career. They are, in the first place, settled as apprentices to farmers of good standing, under the direction of the royal agricultural society. After remaining there for a year or so, they are transferred to another part of the country, where they learn some different part of their business. In this way, they are thoroughly trained in both scientific and practical farming. During their apprenticeship, they receive small salaries for the labor that they do on the farms, and are also allowed books of experience and study. At fixed intervals, they report to the society concerning their progress, and at the end of three years they obtain diplomas of proficiency and are qualified to engage in farming for themselves. In this way, a certain number of persons acquire a thorough knowledge of agricultural operations, and the country at large is, by their example and influence, kept up to the highest mark of agricultural progress. If this plan were prosecuted with a portion of the sons of our wealthy farmers or other young men aspiring to engage in such pursuits, we should, at least, be secured against degenerating. About a year or so ago, we gave a summary of the results which the Hon. O. E. S. earn, teaching school six miles north of Dismal, Dak., with his three children, was caught in the blizzard and was out in it for 23 hours. The boy had his feet frozen solid to the ankles. He will lose both feet. The girl was so cold that she was unconscious for five hours after being found. At Yankton, Dak., several school children were frozen a while returning from school. Many farmers returning home from the town were overtaken and wintered helplessly over the prairie during the night.

While Fuel is Locked Up by a Greedy Monopoly

Garnett City, Kansas, January 4. The Miami Valley glowed with soft light one afternoon last May. The air was heavy with the sweet scent of apple blossoms and hummed lazily with the stir of insect life. The ground was clad with green. The wide, tree-lined road that winds up the valley was deserted. The Tollea homestead, a small, gray house, weather-beaten and with a moss-brown roof, stands at the foot of a long, gently-loping hill, around which the road winds. All persons who have passed along this most beautiful of the Ohio roads will remember the house on account of the many white beehives which stand in an apple orchard adjoining it. Those fruit trees are old, large, and gnarled, and all lean southward, as though they bend before the strong northerly gales, which blow across Lake Erie and up the beautiful valley. Across the bright river from the house, and beyond the meadows where the hay ricks stand, is a long, low line of hills, their crests covered... with forests, which are bright with scarlet and gold when the autumnal foliage is on, and which are restful to the eyes at all times. A young woman stood in the orchard in the shade cast by an apple tree, in which countless pollen-laden bees buzzed heavily from blossom to blossom. She was bareheaded; her left hand was held to her forehead, visitor-like, to shade her eyes from sunbeams which pierced through the overhanging limbs. Her right hand was pressed lightly against the rough bark of the tree. She was leaning slightly forward, gazing intently down the road. She was not remarkably beautiful, nor was she the acme of physical perfection. She was typical of the ordinary farmer's daughter. She was accustomed to comparatively hard toil; she was not remarkably intelligent, but just an average girl, such as are raised by millions on American farms. She was capable of loving one man sincerely and honestly. As she looked through clear gray eyes down the tree-lined road, her face suddenly glowed redly, then as suddenly blushed. She pressed her right hand to her throat, as though to aid her to swallow a lump, and she murmured, "There he is," as a man walking briskly appeared in the road. He saw her standing in the orchard among the beehives. He ceased to walk for an instant and looked intently at her, then placing his hands on the top rail of the fence, he vaulted lightly over it, and walked rapidly toward her. His soft, black hat was upturned and exposed to her view a sunburned, bearded face, which flushed as he approached her. There was nothing extraordinary about the appearance of this young man. The world is full of just such young men. He was typical of farmers' sons. The girl stood motionless until he was within a few yards of her, then, with an exclamation of joy, she rushed forward to meet him. They embraced, their lips met lovingly, and before he released her from his encircling arms, he whispered: "Cousin Mary, I have come for you. The Kansas home is ready." "John," she whispered back to him, "I am ready to go." The next morning they were married, and the following night they were traveling westward in a day coach, because they were poor and could not afford to ride in a sleeping car. As they journeyed, John told her of the home he was taking her to. The Tolleses were two units of the enormous number of immigrants who have poured into Western Kansas and Eastern Colorado during the two years past. The larger portion of these immigrants were and are poor men. They are young, hopeful, and many of them are newly married. They settled on land that has for years been considered to be arid and unfit for agriculture. But it really seems as though the climate of the arid zone had changed, or, more properly, that the wet zone had encroached on the grassy desert. But, be that as it may, last summer was dry in Kansas and Colorado, breezes blew out of the southwest. Kansas and Colorado panted and then scorched. The herbage dried, the earth cracked, water ceased to flow in river and creek beds and stood in shallow pools; the leaves of the corn plants rolled and curled as though exposed to the fiery breath of a furnace, and day after day the blistering sun coursed through a cloudless sky. Lines of little panting birds stood in the shadows cast by telegraph poles. Tens of thousands of acres of usually highly productive corn land baked brick-like in the sun, and the plants died before they reproduced themselves. Extensive areas of wheat were not worth cutting. Direful disaster threatened over the fair land. Men who tilled encumbered acres lay awake nights to think of their cares. How did the larger portion of the newly arrived emigrants fare? Poverty, armed with judgments as with a club, stalked among them and struck them down in scores. Crops were lost on a scale that threatened to bankrupt them. Cattle were sold off to obtain money with which to pay interest on real estate mortgages. Winter approached, and men and women who lived in caves dug into the banks of timberless creeks, or in frail, unplastered houses, mostly of one room, sat and silently looked at one another, afraid to voice their fears. They had but very little, if any, money. Plentiful supplies of healthful food were scarce. They were almost destitute of fuel, and winter was gradually stalking southward from the frozen plains of Manitoba. Daily the people gathered dry cow chips which lay on the range where herds of cattle grazed a few years ago. But cow chips are poor fuel, and the supply was limited. If a settler discovered a place where they were plentiful, he kept his knowledge to himself and secretly visited his fuel preserve as a hunter does a valued game range. These settlers came from regions where coal and wood were cheap, and they could hardly realize that men and women could lose their lives for the want of little coal. Men talked of fuel when they met. They dreamed of piles of coal and long ranks of cordwood when they slept. The Tolles realized that they had to have coal. They had lost their crops and were as poor as their neighbors. To buy coal, it was necessary to take a portion of the small sum of money they had sacredly laid aside to meet the expenses of the coming of a longed-for child. For several days they hesitated to draw from this store; then a sharp, cold night, during which the north wind blew keenly, warned them to prepare, as winter drew nigh. The next morning John Tolles hitched his encumbered horses to his mortgaged wagon and drove 30 miles to town to buy coal. Arrived there, he found many other settlers, all of whom were poorly clad and in financial straits, in town after fuel. All told the same story: Cow chips to burn, no solid fuel, almost a total failure of crops, and hardly any money. These hardy men discussed the possibilities of danger which lurked in coming blizzards freely, as there were no women there to be alarmed. There was no coal in the town. They surrounded the empty bins and demanded of the dealer why he had no coal. "Gentlemen," the dealer said, "I ordered 600 tons of coal weeks ago. The railway company will not haul the fuel for me." He was silent for an instant; then, in further explanation, said: "You see, the directors of this corporation own the controlling interest in the coal mines in the Rocky Mountains and in Missouri, on the output of which we depend for fuel. This railroad company will not supply cars to free mines. The corporation has resolved to put up the price of coal, and they are deliberately creating an unnatural scarcity of coal so as to be able to charge higher prices for it at the mines. They are preparing to form a Western coal trust." "Great heavens, man!" the settlers exclaimed as one man, "we raised nothing this year. We have neither grain nor stock to sell. Our teams and tools are mortgaged. We cannot raise any more money. How does the company expect us to pay increased prices for coal?" "That is just the trouble," the dealer replied bitterly; "you produced nothing this year. You supply no outgoing freight, so you must pay extra on incoming supplies. At least that is the way I look at it. See here, men," he added sardonically, "you have mortgaged your land and chattels and spent the money in improvements and in living. Don’t you see that the railroad corporation can make no further profit out of you? The sooner you are forced to quit the land, the sooner other men, who will afford better plucking, will occupy your places. That is about the size of the thing," he added, as he nodded his head emphatically at them. The settlers, who had listened to the words of wisdom which had fallen from the coal dealer's lips, howled with rage, but they were just men, and their hot anger was directed against the railroad corporation. They climbed into their wagons and rode slowly home, nursing their wrath the while. Arrived there, they shook their heads when their wives looked into the empty wagon boxes, and said savagely: "There is no coal in the town. The railroad company will not haul it for us, curse them!" That night, and for many following nights, and in many shanties and dugouts, the fuel question was earnestly discussed. People went to bed at dark to save the small quantity of fuel they had stored up. They lay abed late in the mornings to aid in accomplishing the same purpose. But they might as well be in bed as anywhere else, as there was no work to be done in Western Kansas and Eastern Colorado during the winter, and then, one does not eat so much when he remains long in bed. As the delightful fall days, warm and pleasant, continued, men and women smiled at one another when they met and said hopefully: "Maybe we will not have a severe winter, and we will get through nicely. We will not have to pay an extra price for coal. We have had a great fright about nothing." And they nodded their young heads to indicate their courage and hopefulness. As the settlers talked and thought and acted, so did John and Mary Tolles. One morning, a few weeks after John had returned crestfallen from town, the south wind was blowing briskly when they awoke. It whistled rather mournfully, as is the wont of vapor-laden winds, around their small house. They arose and dressed, and walked out into the prairie. The sky was cloudless, but hazy. Though it was early in the morning, the air was unpleasantly warm. Tumbleweeds rolled past their hut and chased one another northward over the plains. A meadowlark sat on a dead sunflower stalk and sang sweetly as the tall, slender stalk swayed to and fro. The short brown grass nestled and whispered. A few blue-bottle flies buzzed noisily around the house. All nature seemed to proclaim that spring was near at hand. It was late December. The young people laughed and talked gaily. "Winter is over!" the brave, young wife exclaimed joyously. "How warm it is! The meadowlark is hailing the approach of spring. He is calling to his mate. How foolish we were, John, to be alarmed about fuel. We will do nicely now, and next year we will make a crop and have plenty of everything." And the young woman sang aloud. Ah, how little the young know of the climate of the Kansas and Colorado plains! How ignorant they are of the hardness and cruelty of nature! That afternoon a low, dark line of clouds appeared above the distant northern horizon, the southern sky became overcast, and heavy masses of vapor-laden clouds rushed northward. The air continued to be warm. That night, shortly after the Tolles had gone to bed, a warm southern rain began to fall, and they laughed and talked of the coming crop as they heard it patter on the roof. They had not noticed how reluctant their dog had been to leave the house, nor had they noticed that their few cattle had come up early in the evening. As they talked of the future, they heard a low, faint roar, as though a distant sea foamed on a sandy shore. Steadily the roar grew louder and louder. The dog howled mournfully outside. The cattle lowed plaintively. The Tolles sat up to listen. Then with a crash, the wind whipped into the north. The rain drove furiously against the frail house and blew through tiny cracks in spray on them. Their house shook and trembled. Gusts of wind blew down the stovepipe and caused the light ashes to fly in jets out of the openings in the stove door, as though the stove were a mighty puffball that was squeezed by unseen hands. The dull sound produced by falling rain was speedily replaced by the sharp rattle of hail beating against the house. Then ice particles and fine snow began to sift into the room. Louder and louder the storm raged, until the air resounded with the voice of enraged nature. It grew colder and colder. The young people trembled in bed. They piled all their clothes on their blankets, and there they lay and shook with cold through the night. Before morning they realized that spring had not arrived. Gray light penetrated into the room through its coated windows and announced that dawn had come. The hands of the clock marked 8. The Tolles arose. They were wretchedly cold. They built a fire out of corncobs and cow chips, which hardly gave sufficient heat to warm the stove. As they breathed, frosty columns of vapor issued from their mouths like horns. Outside was an awe-inspiring arctic scene that chilled them to look upon. The air was filled with ice particles and snow which swept almost horizontally through it. An apparently solid and endless mat of snow two feet thick moved rapidly over the frozen surface of the earth. The utmost extent of vision was about twenty-five yards. And the loud voice of nature never ceased to roar over the storm-cursed land. The Tolles were experiencing their first blizzard. As they suffered, and through suffering added to their scanty store of knowledge, their hearts burned with anger at the brutal wickedness displayed by the managers of the railroad company, men who knew. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

The land and its climate, in not hauling coal to the towns along their road for the settlers to buy. They quickly realized the folly of attempting to keep the room warm with the fuel they had. They resolved to hoard it to cook their coarse food, so, after making an unsuccessful attempt to get to their stock, in making which they very nearly became lost in the storm, they went to bed. One day, two days, passed, and they suffered physically and mentally the while. When they awoke on the third morning, the sun streamed redly through the ice-coated eastern windows. The blizzard had passed, the sky was cloudless. It was intensely cold. They arose, dressed themselves, and opened the door to look out. To the extreme of vision, the plains were white. All the ravines were drifted full of snow. Every familiar landmark had disappeared. The cattle shed in the ravine was almost covered with tightly-packed ice and snow. After eating a scanty breakfast of cornmeal and bacon, the Tolles dug a path to their cattle and watered them and fed them. Then they carried straw to their house and rolled and twisted it into bundles to burn in their stove, but it afforded little heat, and the house was very cold. The next day the wind blew from the south, and it seemed to be colder than the north wind had been. The day after that the snow began to melt, and in two days it had disappeared, excepting in the ravines and draws. And the meadowlark returned and sat on the sunflower stalk and sweetly proclaimed that spring was coming soon. The young people realized that they could not live through another blizzard without a supply of coal. But it was thirty miles to the railroad station, and John hesitated to drive that long distance on the mere chance of getting fuel. On the afternoon of the fourth day after the blizzard, a neighbor rode by their house, and as he passed, he shouted to them that there was coal at the town. The young man determined to go to town the following day. The next morning was a delightful December day on the plains. There was not a particle of wind. The grass, coated with hoarfrost, glistened in the sunlight as though millions of tiny electric lights glowed on the prairie. The horses were fed and hitched to the wagon. The young husband came to the house to get money and some food to eat while on the journey. Mary counted the sacred hoard. It amounted to $11. She gave John $5 with which to buy coal. "John," she said, hesitatingly and reluctantly, "if you will sleep in the livery stable in town, it will save some money. You can take one of the blankets; I will not need all of them, as the weather is so warm and pleasant, and you will be back tomorrow, you know." "Of course I am going to sleep in the stable," John said pleasantly. "But I guess I can find bedclothing there. I am afraid to take any from you." He looked at the sky attentively for a few minutes. It was clear to his eyes. He did not notice the faint gray mist hanging just above the plain away off to the north. Again he looked at the sky and saw no sign. "I do not believe it will storm," he said, "and if it is chilly tonight, you can cover up with our clothes." He took the blanket from her outstretched arms and tossed it into the wagon. He leaned over her, and as her arms twined around his neck, he drew her close to him and kissed her lovingly and whispered, "I'll be back tomorrow afternoon, dear." She was loth to let him go. She clung to him and kissed him repeatedly. He laughed nervously and very near to tears as he gently loosened her arms, saying lowly, "I must go, Mary, or the coal will all be gone before I get there." He clambered into his wagon and drove off. The day continued warm. But the young wife was lonely. She was oppressed by the solitude of the plains. Her house seemed to be abandoned. She called her dog and walked over the desolate plains. She gathered cow chips in her apron. She fed and watered the stock. She attempted to kill time, and the day seemed to be the longest and most wearisome she had ever experienced. That night she lighted a lamp and sewed on small garments. She smiled as she worked. Apparently her thoughts were pleasant. Without a particle of warning, the wind rushed out of the north and struck the house with terrific violence. The air became cold almost instantly. But there was no driving snow. The poor young girl listened to the howling wind for an instant, then she bowed her head on the table and cried bitterly, to be aroused from her nervous grief by a blood-curdling chorus outside the house, as though 10,000 devils were exulting there. The dog's hair stood upright on his back, and he growled savagely. Light footfalls pattered around the house. Then the devilish chorus again sounded. Mary sat with a blanched face and faintly throbbing heart, looking through fear-expanded eyes at the door, where she fancied she heard inquiring snouts. Her dog became wildly excited and barked furiously. Mary was so greatly terrified that she no longer felt the cold. She went to bed to hide. She covered her head with a blanket, as a timid child does, and lay awake for hours listening to the coyote's frightful chorus, and listening, she fell into a dreamful, troubled sleep. It was morning, and a few flakes of fine snow shot through the air. Mary arose and fed the cattle. She wondered at the intensity of the cold. The northern sky was black with frozen anger. She built a fire in the stove and boiled a little cornmeal for her breakfast, a portion of which she gave to the dog. It grew colder and colder. The snowflakes were becoming more numerous and appeared to be smaller than they were when she arose, and the wind gathered strength as it blew. Mary glanced at the clock. Its hands marked, "John is at the top of the second divide by this time," she said. Ten o'clock. The snow was falling freely and almost horizontally. The mercury marked far below zero. The noise of the storm was terrific. She became anxious about John. But there were neighbors' houses at intervals on the road, and he would surely find shelter in one of them. And maybe he had not left town. She became nervous. She could not eat. She thought of her Ohio home. Visions of great piles of firewood and bins full of coal arose before her. She conjured up the old gray house and the beehives and the apple trees, and her eyes filled with tears. She grew colder and colder. She crawled into bed and covered herself with the blankets. She grew colder. She arose and stuffed the stove with cow chips. They burned freely but threw out little heat. Fearful for her life, she called aloud for her husband. The shivering dog wagged his tail in answer and came to her. She grasped the axe and chopped a portion of the floor into firewood and burned it. She chopped the furniture into firewood and hovered over the stove with extended hands as the hardwood burned. Darkness fell on the plains. She lighted her lamp and held her half-frozen hands above the glass chimney to warm them. She got her sewing and tried to sew. Her fingers were too stiff to handle the fine needle she worked with, and the small white garments which she was making slipped from her lap and fell on the floor. By midnight the storm had passed and the bright stars shone on a snow-covered earth. The wind fell. Mary continued to feed the stove with bits of hardwood furniture until the room became sufficiently warm for her to go to bed. The mattress lay on the unchopped floor close to the stove. She lay down and covered herself with the thin blankets. She could not sleep. She pictured her husband lost in the blizzard, how glad she was that she had given him the blanket. Then she saw him sleeping comfortably in a neighbor's house, and the wagon partially filled with lumps of coal stood outside—how good it looked. She argued with herself and tried to be cheerful, but there was a strange, unwonted pressure on her heart which would not be reasoned away. At intervals, she slept fitfully, and visions rolled through her brain. She was up early, just as the whitish-gray light began to appear. She was strangely weak and nervous, and she marveled at her condition. While she was trying to build a fire, she heard the crunching of intensely cold snow as wheels rolled over it. She arose and walked to the door, saying, "Thank God, he has come at last!" She opened the door and saw the team of horses, with low hanging heads, wearily approaching the house. No driver sat on the wagon seat. "John is walking behind the wagon to keep warm," she said as she pressed her hands to her bosom to quiet her throbbing heart. The tired, storm-beaten horses slowly approached the house. She saw that the lines were tied around the dashboard. John was not walking behind. "The horses have run away and left him," she whispered with white lips. "That is it. He will come presently." The horses halted in front of the door. She grasped the doorpost with her hands to keep from falling and gazed wildly through terrified eyes far beyond the wagon over the frozen plains. She shrank from looking into the wagon. Her white face became deeply lined. Her heart was compressed as with slowly-shrinking bands of steel. "I know he has remained behind," she whispered lowly. Then, with a supreme effort, she grasped her nerves strongly and walked with firm strides to the wagon and looked over the high sideboard. She staggered back with the infirm steps of age. Did she see her husband? No. She saw a frozen corpse with its legs drawn up as if in pain. She saw a distorted face with a frozen lolling tongue, and eye sockets filled with snow, and the long black hair matted with snow and ice. And the arms of the corpse were extended and the outstretched fingers grasped at the bottom of the wagon as though greedily trying to clutch lumps of coal that were not there. Mary tottered into the house. She crouched on the mattress for a moment and looked wonderingly at the small, white garments which were lying on the floor. She felt tired, very tired, and sleepy too. She tried to rouse herself to action, tried to realize her loss. She reproached herself for not caring for the exhausted horses. But she was so tired and cold and sleepy that she resolved to lie down for a minute before she attempted to do anything. She lay down on the small mattress and gently pulled the blanket over her. She closed her eyes and nestled a little, as though to obtain more comfort. A warm glow pervaded her entire body, and she was mildly surprised that she could have thought the morning was cold. She was motionless for a few minutes. Then a rare smile played around her white lips, her eyes opened wide, and she looked through the open door, and far to the eastward, where the rising sun reddened the heavens. The Kansas life and all its hard, cruel realities disappeared as a troubled dream, and she saw her husband standing under a full-blossomed apple tree in the old orchard. Bees were humming in the overhanging limbs. The Miami River shone as a broad band of silver. The westerly hills were bathed in warm, rosy light. Her husband smiled at her, and with outstretched hand beckoned her to come to him. Mary smiled radiantly in reply and went to him.

18880117: PARSELL SPEAKS He Predicts an Early Government Defeat and Urges Moderation in Parliament, at which His Followers are Offended. Dublin, January 16. A reporter of the Freeman's Journal has had an interview with Mr. Parnell. Mr. Parnell believes there is no doubt that grave dissension exists among the members of the Cabinet, and that a government party crisis may occur at any time next session over some English question. He urges the Parnellites and Radicals to facilitate Government business and thus avoid the charge of obstruction. He says the Liberal Unionists are sure to separate on English matters. Mr. Parnell says the recent reductions of rent made by the Land Commission are not half what the tenants of Ireland are entitled to and urges the party to take such action as will oblige the sub-commissioner to re-examine the whole question. He expresses the belief that the Nationalists will gain three members in history at the next election. The followers of Parnell in Parliament are greatly dissatisfied with the advice given in the interview with a Freeman's Journal reporter to abandon obstruction methods in the House of Commons. Father Point, January 16. At a special meeting of the municipal council of this parish today, Mr. Pierre D. Kuuleau, J.P., was appointed commissioner.

**Reality Threatens to be Added to Canada's Happy Contrast**  
St. Paul, January 10  
The terrible storm which has swept over the Northwestern states, blockading railroads in five states, is now over, and the victims of its fury are being counted. The list is growing almost every hour. It is not improbable, when the record is complete, that it will show that over two hundred lives have been sacrificed to the fury of the blizzard. Next to this, the worst blizzard that the Northwest ever experienced occurred January 7, 8, and 9, 1873. In that storm, seventy people were frozen to death, and thousands of dollars' worth of property was destroyed. The present storm promises to be even more terrible in its results. It came without warning.

**THE BLIZZARD'S HOME**  
The St. Paul Pioneer Press recently entered a vigorous protest against the promulgation of the idea that blizzards are indigenous to the Northwestern States, or, in fact, that they are even known there at all. It gives a graphic description of what it thought a genuine blizzard was and repudiated all acquaintance with storms of that character. It is to be feared that our contemporary will have to withdraw its remarks. Despatches from St. Paul and its neighborhood state that the great storm of last week was not only a blizzard and the worst of the season, but the worst ever known in the Northwest. It exactly filled the bill drawn up by the Pioneer Press and certainly was a blizzard, if ever there was one, unless, perchance, the press correspondents have conspired to deceive us.

**Mail**  
She (just in from an afternoon's shopping and running to her husband): "I've had such a lovely time! I've just come from Blank's, and I saw two such lovely jackets, one at $113 and the other at $225."  
"Well, and which one did you finally buy?"  
"You know, dear, how superstitious I am about the No. 13, so I simply had to buy the $225 one."

**THE DEATH ROLL MOUNTING UP**  
Over 200 lives now believed to be lost—Why?  
St. Paul, January 17  
The recent terribly disastrous blizzard came suddenly, with little or no warning. At sunrise last Wednesday, Dakota never had more lovely winter weather. The air was clear as crystal, and every object about the horizon was distinctly visible. The wind was from the south, warm and balmy, and before the sun was high in the sky, a decided thaw set in. Farmers took advantage of the beautiful weather to go to town, to draw wood and hay. About noon, a cloud was seen along the northwestern horizon, lying close to the ground, but strengthening from the west to the north in a dark semi-circle. Little attention was paid to it, but in an hour the cloud had swept over the country, the sun was obscured, the snow was falling fast, and a gale was sweeping from the northwest with terrific fury. The blizzard had begun. The mercury fell rapidly, and by 5 o'clock it was 15 degrees below zero, and the next morning it registered 30 degrees below. All the while, the wind increased in fury, the snow fell thicker, and the large amount that was already on the ground was blown into powder and whirled along by the wind. On the prairie, an object forty feet distant could not be seen. A man's voice could not be heard six feet distant. The air was full of snow as fine as flour, and the roaring of the wind and the darkness caused by so much snow in the air made the scene the most dismal, drear, and forsaken that man ever looked upon. The death roll continues to pile up, every state, even as far south as Texas and Tennessee, reporting disaster. In addition to the list of 140 heretofore published, the following reports have been received: Tyndall, Dak., says six persons are known to have perished near there. Appleton, Minn., reports that Ole Vig was frozen stiff in his sleigh as his team turned up in his lake in Cerro Gordo. Mrs. Joseph Keff of Yorkton, Dak., started a short distance to get a child home from the schoolhouse and got bewildered and froze near her home. The body of a man was found at Utica. A man named Bruce deserted his team and wandered some twenty miles. When found and brought to Yankton, he was badly frozen and is now in a critical condition. J. Robinson, of Yankton, and A.H. Huid left here for Bon Homme on Thursday and have not been heard from. At Sioux Falls, Dak., the eighth victim of the blizzard was discovered yesterday. It was Erie Erckoon, a farmer living six miles from the city. Henry Bliss, a farmer near Montrose, went to his barn but never returned. James Kennedy, who passed the night in a haystack, was but slightly frozen. His wife and son, who went out to find him, were both frozen.

**IN TENNESSEE AND TEXAS**  
Memphis, Tenn., January 17  
The blizzard which set in Saturday morning still prevails and business is almost entirely suspended. A.L. Davis, a drummer of this city, was found frozen to death this morning in his lodgings.  
Fort Worth, Tex., January 17  
Saturday's storm is abating and five deaths from freezing are reported. Communication with the cattle regions has not yet been opened. The Colorado River, for the first time since the settlement of the country, was freezing over yesterday. Stockmen fear great loss on the plains and prairies. At Belleville, Tex., Chas Jones (colored) was found frozen near his house.

**GRAND FORKS, DAK., January 17**  
An old Englishman, who was lost in the blizzard, buried himself in the snow and lay there all night, and escaped with a few touches of frost.

**STRANGE BUT TRUE**  
Winnipeg, January 17  
Although the cold snap existing over the western part of the continent has been felt here with more than usual severity, no loss of life is reported, save that of one man who foolishly sat in a cutter waiting for help. In Dakota, Minnesota, and the Western States, the number of casualties will reach about 150. A large number are reported missing. There were a number caught in the storms in Manitoba, but, strange as it may appear, there is no loss of life like there was in the American West. The weather is now very moderate; Pacific railway trains have been running with fair regularity and no trains have been cancelled. The first train out of M.P. for nearly a week arrived late. The snow is not nearly so deep this side of the border as further south, nor was the cold as severe. The difference in fatalities is attributed to the fact that the climate of Manitoba is much different than that of the United States. John Maiden, the fourteenth victim of the Bradford disaster, died yesterday morning. He leaves a widow and four children.

Famine-Stricken Christians Call for Help  
St. Paul, January 18  
The most heartrending episodes of the recent blizzard are the loss of life of school children in Dakota and Nebraska, not less than fifty and very probably more being reported dead. Thirty-one school children are missing in Turner County, seven were lost near Lennox, and a teacher and sixteen children at Clear Lake, six of the latter's bodies having been discovered. An Omaha special says: Miss Louie Royce, a school teacher stationed eight miles from Plainview, had three pupils on the day of the storm. She started at 2 o'clock with the children for a house twenty rods distant, but lost her way. All lay down in the snow and Miss Royce wrapped up the little ones as best she could. Early in the night, one child died and later a second one, and just as morning broke, the third child succumbed to the cold. Miss Royce then managed to reach the house less than twenty rods away. Both her feet are badly frozen and will have to be amputated. A school teacher and eight children, names unknown, are reported from Neligh to have perished.

**DIED IN A STRANGE CITY**  
New York, January 19  
Two stalwart middle-aged men applied for a room at the International Hotel yesterday morning and registered as T. Parker and L. Totten, wholesale hardware dealers, were gutted by fire tonight, causing a total loss of $100,000; insurance $15,000.

**A Bad Advertisement**  
St. Paul, January 20  
An evening paper figures the loss of life in last week's blizzard at 235. It is reported from Vermillion, Dak., that over thirty persons were frozen to death in Lake County and that the local authorities are suppressing the news. This rumor lacks confirmation.

**Met a Horrible Death**  
Wellsville, Ohio, January 20  
Samuel Irkit, an old man, who lived with his son-in-law, J. Stinker, on a farm near here, was eaten by hogs last evening in his barn. It is supposed Mr. Irkit, who was very feeble, slipped and fell, and, being unable to rise, was torn in pieces by the savage animals.

**TAKING A LESSON**  
A Sincere Magistrate Dismissed from Office for a Very Good Cause  
(From our own correspondent)  
Toronto, January 20. About two years ago, John T. Partridge was appointed police magistrate of Simcoe County to administer the Scott Act. When the case became few, he hired a fellow named Rathbone on a regular salary to hunt up cases. Rathbone, besides, got a bonus on every case brought into court. The company, however, fell out, Rathbone splitting on it. An inquiry was ordered, and after evidence was taken under oath, the Inspector of the office recommended that Partridge be deprived of his commission. Today, the authorities carried this recommendation into effect. This is the first case in Ontario where a magistrate has been extremely dealt with.

**THE ARCTIC WAVE**  
Halifax, N.S., January 20. The tail end of the blizzard struck this province hard today. It was one of the worst days here for years. All trains are delayed. The cold is very general, as will appear by the following records at the different places mentioned: Below zero—Quebec to Sioux City, IA 15; Cedar Rapids, IA 27.

**NOT A GENUINE BLIZZARD**  
St. Paul, January 20. Specials to the writer indicate that yesterday's storm in southern Dakota and Minnesota, while severe and accompanied by extreme cold, is not to be classed as a genuine blizzard and is not likely to be followed with the disastrous consequences of its predecessor. It has, however, had the effect of filling up the cuts and temporarily suspending railway traffic which was just beginning to be resumed.

**MASONIC**  
Installation of the Officers of Dorchester Lodge, No. 4, St. Johns.

**18880123: C, January 22**  
Mr. Henry Norman, the special commissioner of the Pall Mall Gazette, who is making a tour through the different colonies that form the British Empire, arrived here last night and today carried on a conversation over the Canadian Pacific Railway company's wire. At one end of the wire was Mr. Hearst, of the Examiner, San Francisco, and at the other end Mr. Stead, of the Pall Mall Gazette, London. There was an unbroken telegraph circuit extending from San Francisco to New York, 4,600 miles, the distance from New York to London, via Canso, N.S., being 3,500 miles, or 8,100 in all. The telegraph lines making up this circuit ran from San Francisco to New York, via Vancouver, B.C., and Montreal, connecting at New York with the Mackay-Bennett cable. The telegrams exchanged between San Francisco and London were, therefore, only repeated at New York, Canso, and Bristol, England, the latter place being the landing place of the Mackay-Bennett cable. The object of this experiment was to demonstrate the fact that London and Vancouver were practically within speaking distance of each other, which would, in case of war complications in the East, be of the greatest importance to the British Empire. This unbroken line of telegraph also demonstrated the fact that the Canadian Pacific company's system of telegraphs could be successfully maintained during the most rigorous season of the year. That the railroad could also be kept open, Mr. Norman had just had the very best evidence, as he left Winnipeg at the time the American transcontinental roads were suffering from the recent blizzard, and arrived here with but a few hours' detention en route. At 1:12 PM, Vancouver time, but 9:12 London time, Mr. Norman asked Mr. Stead a question, receiving a reply in five minutes. Then Mr. Stead asked, "How far off are you from London?" "Six thousand nine hundred miles, which, with 1,200 to San Francisco added, makes a grand total of 8,100 miles, the longest circuit ever worked and the greatest feat yet accomplished in telegraphy." The conversation was kept up for a couple of hours, Mr. Norman relating some of his many experiences. Among other things, he said: "This is something more than an exhibition of telegraphic prowess. The trip has been such a revelation of the reality of the empire that I greatly desired to do something to exhibit this in a striking concrete form, and the very kind permission and assistance of the managers of the magnificent telegraph system of the Canadian Pacific Railway and of Mr. Ward, manager of the Commercial Cable Company, of which all the world knows, enables me to do this. I have sailed in an English ship, the Polynesian, 3,000 miles across the Atlantic with an English cable below, travelled by an English railway 3,000 miles through primeval forests, by the greatest lakes in the world, across splendid prairie wheat fields of the empire, over four colossal mountain ranges to here, where I can see the Pacific as I write, and in a few days shall start for a 4,000 miles' voyage in another English ship, the Parthia, over another ocean, and yet I am able here to report myself to you and talk as quick and as easily as if we were speaking through a tube in Northumberland Street. The trip transcontinental and the Saxon yet spoken, as an American poet wrote. Indeed, 11,000 miles, nearly half round the globe, and still the Luton Jack will be overhead, and time and space are annihilated for 7,000 of them. Another year and another cable will annihilate the rest. Is not the wire which unites us the most striking symbol of our imperial unity and an amazing foreteller of the federation which will one day girdle the globe? And is not the click of this key, heard in two hemispheres, more eloquent than all the arguments of the empire's enemies ever penned?"

**GRAND MEETING OF BOOTHS**  
There was once held a grand meeting of Scottish song. The date thereof was some time before or after the year Auchty-nine; the place cannot be fixed with the same exactness, but it was probably near "The Banks an' Braes o' Bonnie Doon," in honor of the "Lad that was born in Kyle." "MacGregor's Gathering" was nothing to this. Songs came pouring in from every quarter. Here came "Jolly Shepherds that Whistle thro' the Glen," and "Braw, braw lads from Gala Water;" and there was an abundance of national music in the shape of "A Hundred Pipers, an' a', an' a'," accompanied by "The Pibroch o' Donal' Dhu;" while yonder, in gallant array, "The Campbells are Coming," "The Bonnets o' Bonnie Dundee," and a numerous company of others. It was moved by "Auld Robin Gray," and seconded by the "Laird o' Cockpen" that "Logie o' Buchan" take the honored place in "The Old Arm Chair." The repast that followed was not what mortals would be apt to think the choicest, the delicacies being such as "The Haggis o' Dunbar," "Bannocks o' Barley Meal," "Caller Herrin'," and "Cauld kail in Aberdeen." For this meeting, however, "Willie Brewed a Peck o' Maut;" and Neil Gow had not yet bade "Farewell to Whiskey," so that after all they might have sung something else on the occasion that "Contented wi' Little, an' Canty wi' Mair." Among the ladies of high rank present were "Annie Laurie," "Mary Morison," "Bonnie Lesley," "Roy's Wife of Aldivalloch," "Highland Mary," "Bonnie Jean," "The Lassie wi' the Lint White Locks," "Maggie Lauder," and "Auld Joe Nicholson's Bonnie Nannie;" while prominent among the other sex were "John Anderson, my jo, John," "Duncan Gray," "Tam Glen," "John Grumlie," "Wanderin' Willie," "Jock o' Hazeldean," "The Rantin', Roarin' Hielanman," "Johnnie Cope," "Alister M'Allister," and "The Soldier Laddie." The chairman gave an account of his wanderings, which had extended from "Maidenkirk to John o' Groats." He had seen "The Bonnie Woods of Craigleath," had wandered by the banks of "Afton Water," among the "Braes of Bredonmyle" and "The Birks o' Aberfeldy." Many hours had he spent "Among the Bloom of My Ain Native Heather;" he had plucked many "A Rosebud by His Early Walk," and knew by name all "The Flowers of the Forest." But wherever he strayed he had never forgotten that he was "Woo'd and Married and A'," and that "For the Sake o' Somebody" he loved best "My Ain Fireside." At every point of the compass he had consoled himself with "I'll Awa to Nannie, O," and indeed, he hoped they would all be able to say at the close of life, "Happy We've been a' Thegither." "Duncan Gray," having just been rejected by "Maggie," was in a very morose mood, wished he was "Where Helen Ho," said "She was fair and fause that caused his smart," and to cheer himself sang, "Oh, are ye sleeping Maggie?" at the end of which "Maggie Lauder" requested him to "Behave himsel' afore folk." "John Grumlie swore by the Deil o' the moon" that "Once he wished he'd ne'er been married," and that for this purpose he had "Gone o'er the water to Charlie," but that now he had learned that his wife was "A Winsome Wee Thing," and that as she "Loves him best ava," he should henceforth go "Marching along," with the motto, "O'er the Muir amang the Heather." At this point entered "Dainty Davie," accompanied by "Jessie, the Flower of Dunblane," and "When she cam' in she bobbit, she bobbit." Envious a little of her sister, "Annie Laurie" whispered, "Gang Doun, the Burn, Davie, and then 'Whistle, and I'll come to Ye, my Lad.'" Davie took her at her word, and in going hummed "Dinna Think, Bonnie Lass, I'm Gaun to Leave You." Then "Laird o' Cockpen" thought there was "Nae Luck about the Hoose," where such sentimental songs were sung; he didn't care for "A Kiss Aboot the Door," "Come Under my Plaidie," "Ulona ask me if I Love Thee," "My Nonnle O," "O could I with Fanav Stray," and such like. He preferred something he could clutch; for instance, "Gie me a Lass wi' a Lump o' Land," "Hey for a Lass wi' a Tocher," and "Jemmy's Bawbee." "The Rantin' Roarin' Hielanman" suggested that for the remainder of the evening the laird should be tied up in "Rab Horn's Bonnet," but Rab interposed, saying, "Jest na, matinna, winna be." After this there was a dance. "John Anderson" began to play "Within a mile o' Eulburo' Toon," when he was interrupted by "Jock o' Hazeldean," who wished him to play first "God Save the King." "Never mind the King," cried "Bonnie Prince Charlie," who was immediately knocked down with a branch of the "Auld Oak Tree" by "Johnnie Cope." As he recovered he grumbled out that he didn't like "A' that and a' that," when he was politely requested to "Whistle ower the last o't." So the evening passed away till the chairman intimated that, as he "Saw the mune, and kent the horn," and as some of them had evidently more than "A wee drappie in their e'e," it was time to break up. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

F. Kinney, agent of the Yankton Sioux Indian agency, arrived at Nebraska City after being nine days on the road. He estimates that the loss of life by the recent blizzard is considerable, but this is denied by Editor McLain of the Minneapolis Journal, who says the Judge's story is ridiculous, as it is impossible he could know the facts after being snowed up himself. The bodies of KoecheriU and his hired man have been found near Big Stone City, Dak., and Charles Wilson of Castlewood, Dak., has also been found. Miss Little of Geneva, reported lost, has been found safe and well with her pupils at a neighboring farmer's.

New York Bay Frozen  
New York, January 22  
The bay at sunrise was one solid mass of ice from Staten Island shore to Long Island. The health officers boarding tug succeeded with great difficulty in ploughing its way to the incoming steamers lying off in the stream. The steamers were a mass of ice up to the foreyard. They all report a heavy gale from the Northwest with intense cold for the past forty-eight hours. The weather quarantine is intensely cold and the ice in the bay is so very thick that it is only barely possible to get through it.

Frye to be Heard  
Washington, January 22  
The Senate has no program of work for the coming week beyond the consideration and, if possible, the passage of the deficiency bill and the educational bill. Should there be any time to spare, it is likely to be consumed in the consideration of miscellaneous matters on the calendar. The regular order will probably give way tomorrow for a speech from Senator Frye, and later in the week for speeches from Senators Palmer and Ingalls. Senator Frye's subject is not certainly known, but it is assumed that he will speak upon the question of the fisheries.

Driven to Desperation  
Omaha, Neb., January 22  
A large number of telegrams have been received at the Union Pacific headquarters, stating that the coal cars of the company have been sacked by farmers in the western part of the state. There is great scarcity of coal along the line of the road in Western Nebraska, and the inhabitants during the recent blizzard have taken forcible measures to replenish their stocks of fuel. On Wednesday last, 100 men took possession of two cars loaded with coal at Coid, and the performance was repeated on Friday at Shelton. Similar occurrences are reported from Gibbon and Kearney.

18880127: Y, January 26  
The worst snowstorm experienced in this vicinity this winter set in last night and continued well into this morning. All the railroads centering here are badly drifted and trains are all delayed. The wind is making their condition worse hourly, and the chances are that several of the roads will be completely blocked before night. The sleeper from Montreal on the Delaware & Hudson road, due here about 7 a.m., is still in a snowbank between Fort Edward and Smith's Basin, and it is not known when it will be able to get through. The blockade is the worst north of here, but it is bad on all sides. The St. Louis limited express on the Erie Railway, due at New York at 11 a.m., is badly snowed in one mile west of Middletown. A Whitehall dispatch says a terrible snowstorm is raging along the west shore of Lake Champlain. It is the worst storm that has visited the section in years.

Boston, January 26  
Reports from Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont state that the heaviest snowstorm for years prevailed all night and travel is badly impeded. Advices from Old Orchard and stations west on the Boston & Maine Railroad say a regular blizzard is prevailing.

Quebec, January 26  
A blinding snowstorm set in last night and continued all day. The country roads are almost impassable in places, the drifts being six and seven feet, while on the levee it has fallen about 18 inches. All the trains have been delayed.

Toronto, January 26  
The heaviest storm of the season was experienced here and in the west today. Trains in all directions were badly delayed, and in some cases abandoned.

Reading, Pa., January 20  
The worst snowstorm that has visited this section for several years prevailed here today. Some of the country roads are simply impassable. Trains on the Reading Railroad and branches were all late, and on the Reading & Columbia Railroad, the train due here at 2:30 p.m. had not arrived at 8 this evening, and is not expected in tonight as it is lying between two snowdrifts at Marretta Junction. At some places along the railroad, the snow has drifted ten and fifteen feet deep. It is learned that a similar state of affairs exists throughout the coal regions and that in consequence not a single colliery was in operation this afternoon and not a ton of coal has been shipped since yesterday.

Saratoga

18880206: B company posts have tended to illustrate what could be done, with knowledge and skill well applied. But we have yet much to learn, and M. Dupuy's paper was a contribution of value to the discussion. The Washington Post, in urging the advisability of directing the tide of emigration from the New England, middle, and old Northwestern States to the South, does not fail to mention the recent blizzard as an argument which nature herself has furnished in favor of the project. That dread invasion of resistless and ruthless climatic forces which left hundreds of hearths desolate and inflicted more injury on humanity than a great battle would have done, furnishes, in the opinion of the Post, a kind of logic which is not easy to gainsay. It may certainly be regarded as a warning to persons looking for a new home to avoid the path of the destroyer. But that path can be avoided as safely and profitably by keeping a little to the north of the range of destruction as by going thousands of miles to the south of it. It is, indeed, a phenomenon that should not be lost sight of that during those weeks of terror, when all persons living in the eastern portion of the continent were in a state of painful suspense as to the fate of their western friends, the tidings from Manitoba and the Canadian Northwest offered hardly any unusual features. The class of persons who go to the American Northwest are more likely to be suited within the confines of the Dominion in the boundless prairie lands of Manitoba and the region beyond than they would be in the Southern States.

A TALK ABOUT THE TREATIES  
Concerning the Chinese and British Convention  
THE SENATE  
THE BOODLERS' FRIEND  
Important Statement About the Passage of Banded Goods Through Canada  
Frye Gets the Information He Wants  
Washington, February 8  
An Associated Press reporter obtained today from Mr. Belmont, chairman of the committee on foreign relations, an important statement with regard to the Chinese question, and also as to the pending treaty with Great Britain. In reply to the questions of the reporter, Mr. Belmont said he felt he could properly state that negotiations had been pending for some time for an amicable settlement of the Chinese question. They had been suspended during the summer in consequence of the absence of the Chinese minister, but had now been resumed and were reaching completion. He understood, in fact, that a draft of the proposed treaty had been transmitted to the Chinese minister today, containing such modifications of existing treaties as would bring about the complete exclusion of that class of emigrants to which the people of the western coast objected. It was only just to the Chinese Government to say that there was no disposition on their part to stand in the way of such an agreement, and he believed there was a strong prospect that within a month we would have a treaty.

which would satisfactorily dispose of the question. It would, of course, be necessary for Congress to enact legislation to carry out the purpose of such a treaty and, therefore, it was desirable that the bills now pending before the House should not be hastily acted upon. Speaking of the pending treaty with Great Britain, Mr. Belmont said as the matter had been so widely discussed through the papers he thought it only just to the administration that it should be known that no clause permitting the extradition of a citizen of the United States for any political offense was included in the treaty sent to the Senate. If there was any such provision now under consideration it must have been inserted as an amendment in the Senate. He declared emphatically that there was no clause in the treaty as submitted to the Senate which surrenders any right which this Government has always upheld, nor was there any provision which could be construed as permitting a surrender on account of political offenses. 

The Passage of Bonded Goods  
Washington, February 8  
In response to the Senate resolution of inquiry, the Secretary of the Treasury today transmitted to Congress a communication relative to the passage of bonded goods into Canada. The last question the Secretary answers by stating that no communications have been had with the Dominion of Canada nor any agreements arrived at touching the transportation of goods across the boundary line in bond, since the abrogation of article thirty of the treaty of Washington. As to what methods have been taken to protect the revenue derived from bonded goods passing the frontier, the Secretary says that he has from time to time made regulations to govern this transportation. The experience of the department is said to have shown that these regulations were sufficient for the protection of the revenue in cases of transposition through Canada of merchandise from one port in the United States to another. All transportation companies doing business within the United States, which have complied with these regulations, have been bonded for the transportation of merchandise and have been permitted to make that transportation by way of connecting routes through the Dominion of Canada. No case has come to the knowledge of the department where any loss to the revenue has resulted from the exercise of this privilege. 

As to the last branch of the inquiry seeking information as to what has been done to enforce the second clause of section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Secretary lays that under the section collectors of customs on the frontier, who are not satisfied that the established through rates are posted at the ports from which the goods were shipped for transit through Canada, are required to treat the freight as foreign production and subject to customs duties. 

An Innovation in Ironmaking  
Washington, February 8  
Acting-Consul Hornstedt, of Moscow, has made a report to the Department of State in regard to an important invention recently patented by a Russian subject and now being successfully worked in Russia. He says: The invention consists of a method to produce iron and steel direct from the ore. The whole secret of the process is the construction of the furnace, which is simple and inexpensive. It will be difficult for our iron masters to believe that under the new process iron ore, after submitting it to the ordinary smelting process, is taken direct from the furnace to the rolling mill and turned into sheet iron, yet such is the case, there being to my knowledge, three furnaces in this country now in full operation and working with great success. There can be but little doubt that this new invention will create a perfect revolution in the manufacture of charcoal iron. Whether the process can be used with equal advantage where coke is the fuel I cannot positively assert, as the furnaces I refer to are worked with charcoal. I am, however, assured that an experiment made with coke was crowned with equal success. 

Mr. Frye's Ignorance Dispelled  
Washington, February 8  
Among the executive communications presented was one from the Secretary of the Treasury, in response to Mr. Frye's resolution of January 20, as to agreements arrived at with the Dominion of Canada touching the transportation of goods in bond. Mr. Frye's resolution, instructing the committee on foreign relations to prepare a statement showing the political organization of the Dominion of Canada and of the several provinces of which it is composed and of the geographical relations sustained by them to the United States and various other matters, was adopted.

The highest fine he knew of was $1.75 out of $11. He produced a copy of the agreement each employee had to sign. It read as follows: "All employees intending to leave the service of the company shall be held to give two weeks' notice of their intention to their overseers, and upon failure to comply with this stipulation shall forfeit to the company the amount of two weeks' wages which shall be deducted from whatever amount may then remain unpaid in the hands of the company. The company may at any time, without notice, discharge any employee for incompetence, unfaithful service, or improper conduct, or for any willful damage done to the property of the company. The employees shall work on all holidays, except on Christmas and New Year's, or any other day that the company may see fit to grant. A copy of the above regulations shall be given each employee at the time of registration." 

Another witness, who gave his name as Garand, is now a fireman but had been a foreman in the cotton factory. In his time there had been children in the factory under years of age. They worked from 6:10 a.m. till 9 p.m. He had seen a foreman kick a child and he felled him with a stick. He was reprimanded for it, but the matter ended there for the foreman had to leave. His own child had been ill-treated and kicked. He had had in his department girls who were earning 40 to 50 cents a day and who were fined $1 in a day. The board then adjourned till Thursday afternoon. 

THE CHINOOK WINDS  
They are described by a Western Clergyman - Origin of the Same  
Rev. John McLean, B.A., of the Blood Reserve, Alberta, writes an interesting article on Chinook winds, peculiar to this country, the warm wafts from which were felt in this city a day or two ago. He says: The Chinook winds are warm winds from the Pacific, and have doubtless received their name from the Chinook Indians, a tribe on the western coast, where, also, there is in extensive use an intertribal form of speech called the Chinook jargon. The cause of this singular phenomenon lies in the warm currents of air flowing northward along the coast from the Gulf of Mexico, passing at irregular intervals in large quantities through the mountain passes and in lesser quantities over the crests of the mountains. In their course eastward they lose their moisture in the form of rain and snow, and as dry warm winds reach the plains on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. They blow throughout all the seasons of the year, but are most susceptible in the winter, owing to the sudden change in the temperature. Sometimes in force they resemble a gale, driving the snow from the prairies into the coulees, and again they come as a gentle zephyr, causing such a sudden transition in temperature as to melt the snow in two or three hours. The Chinook belt of the Alberta district is in width about 125 miles, extending from Calgary to the international boundary line, not including the stretch of country in Montana affected by it. The influence of the rise in the temperature is felt as far eastward as Maple Creek. During a spell of cold weather the experienced observer will notice a heavy mist gathering around the base of Chief Mountain, and in a short time the change will come. Oftentimes have I gone out when the thermometer registered 20 and 30 degrees below zero, not a breath of wind was stirring and no sign of a change was apparent, but suddenly I have heard the sound of the wind in the Kootenay Pass, resembling the rumbling noise made by a railroad train at a distance, and in half an hour the snow began to disappear rapidly, the ice in the river became rotten, and in three or four days, although it had been two feet thick, it was carried away, leaving the river clear. There are striking differences of temperature in these winds; from the cold blizzard driving the snow, and becoming dangerous for man and beast to travel, to the almost imperceptible wind that causes the water to flow down the creeks for several days. The first Chinook I experienced was in the winter of 1880, when the thermometer registered a change of 18 degrees in as many minutes, and the domestic cattle that had remained in town during the short period of cold weather went off alone to the prairie for pasturage. Having spent a few days in Calgary nearly every winter since coming to the country, I was peculiarly impressed, after the railroad had reached there, when a telegram arrived from Winnipeg stating that the thermometer registered 40 below zero, and there we were feeling quite comfortable in summer clothing, and the fires in the houses all out, save those used for cooking purposes. I have seen men playing cricket and engaged in outdoor occupations on Christmas and New Year’s days. Ploughing has been done in January, and potatoes planted in March. Still, we cannot rely upon these precedents, as the winds are irregular. Last winter we had a period of cold weather that lasted seven weeks, with not more than four warm days during that period, and the present winter is similar in its character. Were it not for these winds, the prospect of our country being suitable for grazing purposes would be very serious. I have been asked if these sudden changes in temperature were not very injurious to the health of the settlers, and invariably I have answered, "Not to my knowledge." I have had one singular experience on this matter, which may be worth recording. From the time when I buried the first person in MacLeod's new cemetery, every funeral at which I have officiated or attended there has been when the cold was over 20 below zero. Meteorological records kept by the settlers in different sections of the country would prove a great help to our interests and be an important addition to science. The data thus collected would assist scientific students in solving the difficulties in connection with this important subject. A man's wife should always be the same, especially to her husband, but if she is weak and nervous and uses Carter's Iron Pills, she cannot be, for they make her "feel like a different person," at least so they all say, and their husbands say so too.

Day until Sunday. The velocity of the wind, which came from the southwest, was something frightful. All trains were abandoned.

18880220: A CAPITAL SPEECH Cowan, of Gait, Depicts the Greatness of Canada and her Happy Condition. Mr. At the annual banquet of the Canadian manufacturers held at Toronto, on Wednesday evening last, the following excellent speech was delivered by Mr. Thomas Cowan, of Gait, in response to the toast "Fair Canada." It is well worthy of careful perusal at the hands of our readers: After some introductory remarks he said: I have not language sufficient to respond to this toast as I would like to do. Before going any further, however, I will take the opportunity of thanking the Toronto members of the association on behalf of their brother members from the country for the exceedingly kind manner in which you have entertained us, your country cousins. This is the first occasion in the life of the association in which our annual gathering has taken the character of a festival, and now at last our opponents may say that we are bloated monopolists (Laughter). Toronto is a city fighting for the development of a Canadian national sentiment which we give expression to on the present occasion. I am Canadian and Canadian is all I expect to be, and I am happy to know it. We have developed a Canadian policy, and all we want now is to put a curbstone to what we have done by developing a Canadian national sentiment (Applause). We admire any man who is proud of his country no matter where he comes from, whether from the sunny South or from Greenland's icy mountains. We admire that man for his national pluck, and though it may be carried too far at times, the offence is one which leads to virtue's side. You may know from my accent that I am a Canadian with Scotch proclivities (laughter), and I will tell you a little story of Scotch conceit. A little boy, in pointing out his native town of Paisley, after calling over with pride the names of many celebrated Paisley men, said, "And I was born in Paisley myself!" (Laughter) That is Scotch national conceit, and we, whether we come from Scotland, England, or Ireland, bring it with us; but while not laying that aside, let us endeavor for our new country to build up such a national sentiment that any young Canadian travelling in any country of the world may say with pride, "I was born in Canada, and am a citizen of no mean country." (Applause) Let us CONSTRUCT THE AMI, OF CANADA. It is 3,000,000 square miles, while the area of the entire continent of Europe is only 1,000 square miles larger than our Dominion. The area of our Dominion is thirty times larger than Great Britain and Ireland together. It has been said that Scotland could be buried in one of our inland lakes and no one would know where it had gone to except that he might smell the Scotch whiskey (Laughter). When I was in Scotland, I went to see St. Mary Lake and expected to see a magnificent sheet of water with all the poetic surroundings which Sir Walter Scott had given it. And when I stood in the presence of it after coming from Canada, I thought I was looking at a pool (Laughter). Comparing our country with the United States, we find that it is 60,000 square miles larger without Alaska and 14,000 square miles larger than the United States and Alaska combined. Yet as Canadians, we are always coming to the conclusion that we are a small country. Why, the seven provinces of the Dominion are 17,000 square miles larger than the whole of British India. It is a country of illimitable possibilities, and a land whose mountains bring forth iron and other minerals is not to be despised. I was glad to hear our chairman refer in such fine terms to the pioneers of the country. There is one sentence of Goldwin Smith's which shows a true appreciation of the work done by the young settlers. Speaking of the past political history of the country, which to him means a rivalry between contending parties, he says, "The record of those rivalries and controversies will be gathered by the historian into a very narrow urn, but there is a history, if it were recorded, or able to be recorded, which would be interesting indeed and would be to us a religion of gratitude, and that is the history of the pioneer in all his lines. A monument of that history is the fair land in which we live." These men came from the old country with pluck, determination, and heroism, to make a home out of the Canadian forest. This afternoon we heard many loyal expressions of Canadian sentiment to follow up in the grand work of our fathers. We cannot do that by relying outside of Canada except the grand old British Empire of which we are the subjects (Applause). Let us be Canadians first and Canadians always, however. Here we have absolute self-government and more absolute control than the people of the United States or any other country. The President of the United States is elected for a term of four years, and it would take nothing short of civil war to upset any decision of his. Now look at our Canadian Government; take the Mowat Government for instance. A majority of one vote on the floor of the Ontario Legislature would send Mowat into the cold shades of the Opposition (laughter), and in the Dominion Government also, though it would be a terrible calamity, one vote would unseat Sir John (Laughter). We are more republican here than our neighbors to the south. In the old country, they are wanting home rule for Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. We could give them here as much home rule as they want out of what we have too much. The Canadian people have home rule. Will you allow me to say to remember the altar hymn? (Applause and laughter). We have little differences such as the present in the Northwest. I would give Moronsy and Greenway a little advice. Why should they speak disparagingly of the great Northwest and Manitoba? Are the people of the Northwest laboring with any such difficulties as the people of Minnesota and Dakota have? (A voice: "No, sir!") Why, if the people of the Northwest had any such thing as a blizzard, it would give some excuse to the pessimists. While the 125,000 cattle are secure under the shade of the Rocky Mountains, the cattle in Dakota and Minnesota are dying by thousands from blizzards in winter and drought in summer. But let us in our prosperity here still remember the glorious old flag which gives political and religious security in any country over which it floats. (Loud applause) Omaha man: "Went to a spiritual séance down in Arizona, eh? Anything happen?" Arizona man: "Well, yes. The medium went into a trance and then announced that he was a spirit of a man who had been murdered, and that the murderer sat in the audience." "Well, well! Did anybody run?" "We all ran!"

18880225: THE WESTERN HARVEST. It gave him great pleasure this year to be able to congratulate his friends from Manitoba on last year's bountiful and abundant harvest, which enabled her now to send her millions of bushels of the best grain ever grown on Canadian soil to the markets of the world (Applause). It is only now we are beginning to learn of the immense wealth and the abundant resources of Manitoba and the Territories and their immense importance to this our common country. The immense harvest of last year showed that they could form no adequate idea of the future possibilities of this fertile land, which, in a short time, would become one of the greatest, if not the greatest, agricultural provinces in this confederation. The only want he could find in the country was the want of population. Their schemes for turning the tide of emigration from the countries of the old world to this portion of the continent of North America were not so successful as they could have wished. They could hope for better prospects in this direction in the future, but they had this fact to be proud of: eighty-five percent of our population was a native-born population, and when they considered the development of their country and the great and valuable public works constructed, they could point with pride to the fact that this development and those works were the result of native energy (Hear, hear). He spoke of the libels which had been circulated about the severity of the climate of Canada, with the object of preventing immigration, and pointed out that while this year the Canadian farmer was enjoying in peace and comfort the proceeds of his bounteous harvest, lives and property were being sacrificed to the severity of the blizzards in Dakota and the American Northwest (Hear, hear).

18880228: REPATRIATION OF CANADIANS. Mr. Burgess devotes a couple of paragraphs of his report to this subject, being of the opinion that an extensive movement among Canadians settled in Dakota to return to Manitoba and the Northwest exists. He quotes a letter from Duncan Sinclair, the Dominion Land surveyor, who, with his family, left Manitoba for Dakota several years ago, because, as he says, he was discouraged by the summer frosts and because of the Canadian Pacific Railway monopoly. In his letter, he expresses the opinion that care on the part of the farmers will enable them to escape the effects of the frost, and certainly the improved farming of last year and its results would indicate that Mr. Sinclair is right. In respect of the railway, "Manitobans," he says, "would find railway monopoly as grasping here as any part of Canada." The following quotation from Mr. Sinclair's letter is given: "The terrible blizzards which we have had for the last three weeks have sickened me of the country more than anything else. It is a hard thing to be on the prairies of this country without shelter of trees, and it is sad to think that so many people in this territory have lost their lives in snowstorms. The Canadian settlers of this territory are now in a poverty-stricken condition. All their pre-empted lands are mortgaged to the capitalists to pay the Government price, and their cattle are held under chattel mortgage for small sums at short periods bearing 50 percent interest, payable to the pawnbrokers, who euphoniously call themselves bankers." Mr. Sinclair and his whole family have made arrangements to return to Strathclair on the Little Saskatchewan. The information which he gives about the condition of settlers in the Western States was confirmed by a statement in a recent Chicago paper, to the effect that $200,000,000 of foreign capital is invested in mortgages in Kansas and Nebraska, and that the foreign lenders are about to foreclose and will in a short time become the proprietors of these lands under their mortgages. 

ROCKY MOUNTAIN PARK. Reference is made to the operations at Banff. Fifteen miles of road have been opened up to the 31st of December leading to the Hot Springs, the Cave Spring, and the Basin, to Bow River Falls, to the new Canadian Pacific hotel, and to Devil's Head Lake, constituting most lovely drives for summer tourists. An iron bridge across Bow River was opened on the 19th of October last, and also one across Spray River near its junction with the Bow. The necessary piping to conduct the waters of the Hot Springs to an iron reservoir specially constructed for that purpose, and piping to connect the hotels and bath houses to this reservoir with a view to the distribution of the water have recently been completed. The work of underbrushing the park and the removal of all clean timber, with a view to reducing to a minimum the chances of fire, has been going on. There is now a permanent population in the town of Banff of 650, and it is estimated that during last summer upwards of 3,000 guests remained over. The probability is that, with the opening of the new hotel and the partial completion of the drives through the park, there will be a very large increase of visitors during the coming season. The report contains appendices giving details of the work done and altogether constitutes one of the most interesting of the blue books produced this year.

could not get goods direct. Mr. Edward Mutu'tir, of Frothingham & Workman, knew nothing of a combine among colliery hardware manufacturers. Mr. Hall'in said he knew of the combine who bought from a Three Rivers manufacturer of these goods. Guard Mu was to sell to three or four firms here. Some undertakers were not a credit to the profession; as soon as they saw a crape on the door they would solicit the custom. An undertakers' association was formed. The association requires members to have a certain equipment before they can become such. It was understood that certain large undertakers should control, in a measure, the sale of colliery trimmings. Every undertaker in the city, with the exception of one in the outskirts, is a member of the association. The manufacturers will not sell to undertakers unless they are of good standing. There is a colliery called the hospital coffin. Witness could not tell the profit made on trimmings. Mr. Hall'in made a motion that the Allan line be requested to furnish the Labor Commission with the number of ship laborers contracted for in 1886-1887; hours of work, insurance, number of hours worked continuously and otherwise, insurance paid, fines and deductions. Carried. Also, that the St. Aune's and Hudson mills be required to furnish particulars of fines and wages confiscated in 1887, hours of work, and other particulars. Carried. The above companies are given till the return of the commission to Montreal to prepare these.

18880314: KNOCKED OUT BY A STORM The Empire City Gets The Full Force of the Blizzard BUSINESS AT A STANDSTILL All Railways Blocked as Never Before The Loss Put at Ten Millions Many Frozen to Death New York, March 13 New York, in the expressive language of the boxer, was completely knocked out by the blizzard yesterday, and is today in the condition of a man struggling back into vitality and action after a stunning blow. The city is still dazed and a good many of its functions are still completely suspended. There are hopeful signs, however, in all directions. The big railroads are blocked in all directions, but the elevated roads are beginning to show symptoms of renewed activity. Sleighs are taking the places of the almost useless wagons in the streets and trains are running with something like regularity across the East River bridge. There has been a very big boom in pedestrianism within the last forty-eight hours and thousands of estimable persons have found that a pair of legs are very useful articles at a pinch. The storm reached the height of its fury yesterday afternoon, but it was not until this morning, perhaps, when the air was clear and it became possible to look out, that the full extent of its power and the mischief wrought by it could be appreciated. Many years have elapsed since such scenes of desolation have been witnessed in the streets of New York and Brooklyn. In almost every case the traces of sidewalks and curbs had been obliterated, and nothing met the eye but drifts of varying depths, some of them as deep as five feet. Front stoops in thousands of instances, especially on the north side of the streets, were buried out of sight. Here or there was a stranded wagon or horse car, bearing mute but eloquent testimony to the power of the elements. Signposts and awnings are down in every direction, some of the largest and heaviest of them completely blocking the sidewalks, and on all sides are to be met tangle of wires, telegraph, telephone, and electric light, in all of which there may lurk a subtle but terrible danger. There is a great demand for snow shovellers and no laboring man who can buy, beg, or borrow a spade or a pick need want remunerative employment. The Brooklyn horse cars ran longer than those of New York yesterday, but they too gave up the battle early in the afternoon and this morning all the tracks were in the same hopeless condition as those in New York, buried two or three feet under the snow. To make matters worse, the snow on top of them is becoming rapidly solidified into a mass closely resembling ice, which will last until May if it is not speedily broken up. When the horse cars will be running again is a question which is vitally interesting to everybody, for the Elevated road, although it ran with tolerable regularity this morning, is, of course, utterly incapable of affording accommodation to the mighty host of Brooklyn men who do business in New York. Most of those who do not live near the line of the Elevated road, boldly set out this morning to walk to the former on the bridge and a good many of them had to do a vast amount of wading before they reached a latched track. In the business part of the city walking was tolerably good. In one respect, however, Brooklyn folks were worse off today than yesterday, for the ferries were almost stopped by ice floes and the bridge cable had not been got into working order, although trains were run over both roads by the aid of locomotives. Many hundreds availed themselves of the permission of the bridge authorities to walk over the structure. The whole roadway was clear soon after noon, a big gang of Italians having been set to work upon it. Some hundreds of men and boys who did not care to walk over the bridge, and got tired of waiting for the ferries, walked across the river between Fulton ferry on one side and Martin's stores on the other. By hook or by crook the residents of Brooklyn, or most of them, contrived to make their way to New York places of business, but the New Jersey men were in just as bad a plight today as they were yesterday, and perhaps were not quite so well off. All the roads running out to suburban neighborhoods were snowed up as tightly as ever, and even the most fortunate persons who live within easy reach of the ferries experienced great difficulty in getting across the river on account of the ice. At the Signal Service station, Sergt. Dunn said: "The worst of the storm has passed us, and is now central somewhere off the coast. New England is getting what we had yesterday, only probably a little more of it. We have no reports from any point in New England, as all of the wires are down in that section of the country. The total amount of snow which fell in this city during the storm yesterday was just two feet on the level. The highest velocity recorded by the wind gauge was fifty miles an hour between 1 and 2 o'clock this morning. The temperature as recorded by our thermometer at 5 o'clock this morning, was 5 above zero. This is the lowest point reached by the thermometer during the storm." 

A Coal and Milk Famine The complete blockade of traffic of all kinds in the streets has interfered with business very greatly in the hotels, restaurants, and eating houses. It is impossible for the managers of these institutions to get supplies of coal and provisions sufficient for their needs. There was no milk received at any of the railroads, and the stock of condensed milk has been exhausted. No trains had arrived at the Grand Central depot this morning since Sunday. Drifts in some places are nine to ten feet high, and it is impossible for trains to get through. Hundreds of people were caught in the snow drifts on the other side of the Harlem River and stayed in the trains all day yesterday and last night in the bitter cold. The greater part of the passengers preferred trusting to the trains to risking their lives in the snow and wind, but this morning they decided to risk it and made various shifts to get to quarters. During the night the steam gave out and the people had to keep in motion in order not to freeze. Hunger was added to the discomforts, but a speculative Mott Haven man reached the trains with a supply of whiskey and sandwiches which were eagerly taken. A milk train from Riverdale was caught with the others and this was filled quickly by the passengers. The Elevated roads began early trying to put trains through and made good time to the northern terminus, but had difficulty in getting back and engines were sent out with only a single car. This was a mere prop in the racket and the waiting crowds at the stations turned away and either went back to their homes or walked downtown. At about 11 o'clock two cars and occasionally three-car trains were run through to the City Hall station and the traffic steadily improved. The drifts on the west side of Broadway were in many places at least 6 feet high and only a narrow space between the shop fronts and the drifts was left for people bound for their places of business. At times for nearly a whole block only the tops of their heads were visible above the snow. Here and there along the roadway and in the side streets loaded trucks were standing evidently abandoned yesterday. It seems impossible to get Broadway in condition to run cars under a week. The snow is easily two feet deep on the level, well packed down and in some places it is packed just as hard and fully four feet deep. Business in the dry goods district is almost at a standstill. No mails have been received from out-of-town points since yesterday. At the ticket offices of the railways, placards are displayed today announcing that "all trains are abandoned," etc. Seven pilot boats went ashore in the blinding storm of yesterday. They will probably all prove complete wrecks. A sorrowful crowd of pilots crowded the office of the pilot commissioners today and told of their awful experience of yesterday. Many had their hands so badly frozen that amputation may be necessary. George D. Barremoro, an importer of hops, was found frozen stiff in a snow bank on Seventh Avenue this morning. He had started for his office yesterday and was overcome by the storm. The body of Annie H. Fisher, aged 30, was found last night frozen stiff in the hallway of a house on 30th Street. 

The Telegraphs Crippled The condition of the telegraph and telephone wires is quite as bad as yesterday. Nearly 300 men are at work repairing the wires in this city. Occasional messages from the West and South have been received. The company expects to be able to resume by tomorrow. Hundreds of poles are down in and near this city. The telegraph companies have never been so seriously crippled before. It is estimated that the storm caused a loss of at least ten million dollars to New York's railroads, business men, and wage earners. At 8 o'clock tonight a fine penetrating snow was still falling, but early tomorrow morning an army of men and carts will try to clear up certain of the most-needed streets. Hour by hour additional casualties are being reported by the police, and the victims whose arms or legs have been broken are almost innumerable.

Blocked Legislators Albany, N

18880315: ALL QUIET IN THE WEST Rumors of Impending Trouble with the Indians and Breeds Denied. Winnipeg, March 14 Despatches received in the Call office tonight from Regina, Edmonton, and Battleford state that there is no trouble among the Indians as reported. There is some distress among the Metis and Indians who sold their treaty privileges last year owing to the failure of their crops and it is believed they will have to be assisted, but beyond that, matters are quiet.

The Chinese Treaty Washington, March 14 The Chinese treaty was signed yesterday. It prohibits the entrance of Chinese labor into the country during a period of twenty years, and gives an indemnity of $275,000 for violence to the Chinese. It allows Chinese having families here or property to the value of $1,200 or more to go to China and return to this country on proof of facts.

THE TWIN CITIES RECOVER Somewhat from the Effects of the Great Blizzard MANY LIVES SACRIFICED Malden Island completely Blockaded Several Vessels Reported Lost Railways Somewhat Relieved. New York, March 14 The battle against the snowdrifts, which was carried on all day yesterday and throughout the greater part of last night, has effected a considerable change for the better in the condition of the two cities of New York and Brooklyn, so far as the means of internal communication are concerned, and the streets of both began this morning to show some signs of renewed activity. The New Yorkers had an advantage over their Brooklyn brethren, for they had four elevated roads running with something like their ordinary regularity, and an immense number of business men were thus enabled to get to their offices with comparative speed and comfort, whereas in Brooklyn there is only one elevated road in running condition, and that was so vastly overtasked that it was of little appreciable benefit to anybody who did not live almost on the line of it. Thousands of Brooklynites trudged manfully along the various thoroughfares leading to the East River bridge and seemed to enjoy the unusual exercise. The side streets everywhere are still in a very bad state, both in this city and Brooklyn, and miles of sidewalks are still covered with drifts, through which the occasional wayfarer is compelled to flounder shoulder-high. Broadway in New York has been partly cleared from Madison Square to the Battery and all the principal avenues will soon be opened if no more snow comes along. In Brooklyn, Fulton Street has been partly cleared for miles. One of the chief inconveniences arising out of the present situation is the want of milk. The supply of fresh milk gave out long ago and there is reason to fear that the supply of condensed milk will not last much longer. A great many households, too, especially among the poorer classes, are suffering for want of coal. There is plenty of meat and flour, so that the city...

is not likely to suffer from starvation, even if another snowstorm should befall it. But the improvement in business in general is very slight. The retailers, of course, find plenty of customers, but the big wholesale men who depend on the mails, the telegraphs, and the railroads for their transactions are helpless. The tangle of telegraph wires is almost as bad as ever, and it is difficult to communicate even with neighboring towns. Staten Island Blockaded It is impossible to get any word from the interior of Staten Island and the amount of the damage done by the storm cannot be ascertained. It has been learned that three trains on the Rapid Transit road are snowed in at Annandale, about ten miles from Stapleton, and the passengers are being cared for at an inn. Several calamities on the water are reported. The ferry boat Maid of Berth was sunk at her dock at Staten Island, but all the passengers were saved. Alex Bennett, John Leo, and another employee of the Singer company at Elizabethport were lost in crossing Staten Island Sound on Monday afternoon. Nailed Without Cargoes The wires between this city, Sandy Hook, Quarantine, Fire Island, and the Atlantic seaboard are down, and marine news is obtained with great difficulty. The belief is that a number of wrecks occurred on the coast during the blow, but on account of the loss of the wires, nothing definite can be learned. The North German Lloyd steamer Lahn sailed today for Bremen without cargo, as it was impossible for shippers to deliver freight. She had only forty passengers on board. There were a hundred others booked, but they are snowbound and could not get here. The steamers France and Britannic, which should have sailed today, will sail tomorrow. Like the Lahn, they will go without cargoes. Sarcastic Sympathy, Mayor Hewitt has received several dispatches from points in Dakota and one from St. Paul expressing sympathy with the blizzard sufferers of New York and tendering aid. The dispatches say that the weather in the Northwest is mild and beautiful. Funerals Snowbound Long Island City March 14 Another train arrived here from Jamaica.

18880316: WHAT PRODUCES HOWLING BLIZZARDS In this same condition seems to lie found the valuable immunity which western Canada and the northern border of the United States enjoy from those fearful blizzards that devastate southern Dakota and make cattle and cattlemen shiver even on the coast of Texas. These winds all come from the far Northwest and have blown, perhaps, a thousand miles across Canada before they become blizzards. But their course over the Saskatchewan, Qu'Appelle, and Assiniboine plains, and down the Winnipeg valley, is continually impelled. First, the country is everywhere uneven and often broken by respectable hills; second, large areas of it are covered with a scrub of bushes, or dotted with copses of trees, all of which check and divert the gale; third, these winds are moving steadily uphill, and their speed is as continuously checked by friction against the earth, as is that of a railway train climbing a gradient. A wind will blow downhill faster than up, just as a stone will roll downhill easier than it can be pushed up. Finally, the air in the north is so nearly the temperature of the gale that it is not sucked forward with greatly accelerated speed until it nears the warmer latitudes where more heated and rarified air is rising from the more southerly plains, and this cold northern air is drawn in to fill the vacuum. But by the time the "norther" has reached Nebraska, it finds itself blowing across plateau lands, at the top of the hill, where there is not a bush nor tree nor range of hills to check it, and the vacuum is close in front. It has been a respectable wind in the Northwest; a terrible gale in Montana; in southern Dakota and Nebraska, it becomes a death-dealing blizzard. How do the people who live in the West like this climate? They universally praise it and laud especially its healthfulness. They speak of it as extremely stimulating and conducive to good spirits and courage. The secret of this is its dryness. The atmosphere is bright, and when in winter it is very cold there is seldom any wind. Let a man take ordinary care of himself, and he will live longer and grow stronger on these prairies than anywhere else in the world. A peculiar exhilaration of body and soul belongs to the climate, especially in and about the Rockies, which is the choicest of regions for camping excursions and sporting trips. The senses are so quickened by the clear, vivifying climate of the western uplands in summer that an outdoor life is tenfold more pleasurable there than it would be in the East. And then one's sleep in the crisp air, after the fatigues of the day, is sound and serene. You awake at daylight, perhaps, readjust your camp blankets, and want again to sleep. The sun may pour forth from the "golden window of the East," and flood the world with limpid light; the stars may pale and the jet of the midnight sky be diluted to that pale and perfect morning blue, into which you gaze to immeasurable depth; the air may become a pervading champagne, dry and delicate, every draught of which tingles the lungs and spurs the blood along the veins with joyous speed; the landscape may woo the eye with airy undulations of prairie or snow-pointed pinnacles lifted sharply against the azure, yet sleep claims you. That very quality of the atmosphere which contributes to all this beauty and makes it so delicious to be awake, makes it equally blessed to slumber. Lying there in the open air, breathing the pure elixir of the untainted mountains, you come to think even the confinement of a flapping tent oppressive, and the ventilation of a spruce-bough bad. Mr. Ingersoll was warmly applauded on the conclusion of his lecture.

18880319: The cattle market was quiet. Receipts, 3,400 head. Local Provisions A fair amount of business was done in local provisions, and the market was fairly active with prices steady. Pork changed hands in small lots at quotations: Canada short cut, brl $17.50 & $18.00. Mess pork, western, brl $17.00 to $17.50. Shortcut, western, brl $17.50 to $18.00. Thin mess pork, brl $16.00 to $17.50. Mass beef, brl $6.00 to $10.00. Indian mess beef, brl $6.00 to $10.00. Hams city cured, lb 11½ to 12½; canvassed, lb 12 to 12½; green, lb 10 to 11. Flanks, green, lb 8½ to 9. Lard, western, in pails, tub 10½ to 11. Canadian, in pails 9 to 9½. Bacon, lb 10. Shoulders 8 to 8½. Tallow, com refined, 4 to 4½. The hog market has continued quiet, there being little demand and business was quiet at steady prices. We quote jobbing lots $7.50 to $7.75 per 100 lbs. Ashes There was no change in ashes, business being quiet on account of the light receipts, and prices were unchanged. We quote pearls $7.50, first pots $4.25 to $4.30, and second $4.90 per 100 lbs. Butter The market for butter was quiet and practically unchanged. There was a moderate local trade, from which source there was about the usual call for finest, which realized full prices, while low grades continued dull and easy. The New York Commercial Bulletin says: "The past week has been one that will long be remembered in the history of New York City. The blizzard reached here early Monday morning and completely paralyzed business of every description. Railroad trains were stalled on all roads leading into New York, telegraphic communication was cut off from nearly all points, all lines of city transportation were compelled to cease running, people were unable to reach their places of business, and nearly all channels of trade were at a complete standstill. Very little trading in butter was possible on Tuesday or Wednesday, but Thursday and Friday there was a moderate demand from retailers, who were out of stock, but the snow blockade made it only possible to move such small quantities as were absolutely necessary. Stocks in store here have greatly diminished, as there have been no freight trains in all the week, and the market presents a strong tone for all edible grades, but it is hoped the delayed stock or enough of it to prevent a famine will reach here in time to meet the increased wants of the trade, which will be expected as soon as the streets are in a condition to make deliveries less difficult. In the meantime, dealers are taking such small lots of most any grade they can work along with to tide them over." 

Cheese, The market for cheese has ruled quiet. Bids have been made, but were not accepted by holders, who refused to take less than 11½ for finest white. The exports from New York are given at only 1,000 boxes for the week. The New York Commercial Bulletin of today's date says: "There is practically no cheese market to review this week, as for several days no business at all appeared to have taken place, and the few subsequent transactions are hardly of a character to shape affairs. Entirely independent of the temporary snow blockade as a quieting factor, however, some of the trade evidently commence to worry, and the easier tendency referred to a week ago is more pronounced. Indeed, there seems to be quite a little effort to place colored stock and at such shading on value as to warrant a modification in the line of quotations, with pretty much everything else except strictly fancy white in sympathy. The standoff has continued longer than calculated upon, and, with no present indication of reviving demand, holders undoubtedly feel a little tired and more or less anxious to close out. Advices from abroad, too, are lacking in encouragement, and some quote slightly easier figures. A private letter from Liverpool reports 40,000 boxes New Zealand cheese landing, equal to about 16,000 boxes States, and somewhat significantly adds that if the New Zealand business should increase it must make quite a revolution in trade, as the cheese arrives during the period when both our own and the English production is suspended, and, the correspondent claims, would, if plenty enough, do away with the necessity for carrying stocks." 

Finest September and October 9 to 10. Fine 10 to 11. Finest August 10 to 11. Medium 8 to 9. 

THE CATTLE MARKET During the early part of the week the cattle market was quiet owing to the light supply offered, which was on account of the severe snowstorm, and cattle for Thursday's market did not arrive until Friday; consequently, butchers could not fill their wants, but at the end of the week the market was active, there being a brisk demand for good cattle and all the offerings were taken at firm prices and a good business has been done. The receipts of cattle for the week were 482 head, and sales for the week 393 head. On hand for export 10 head, and for sale 29 head. Good export cattle averaging from 1,250 to 1,400 lb sold at 3½ to 4½; medium from 1,100 to 1,200 at 3¼ to 4½; good butchers from 1,000 to 1,100 at 3¼ to 4½; medium do at 2¼ to 3¼, and culls at 1½ to 2½ per lb, live weight. There were no sheep or hogs received during the week. The receipts of calves were thirty-five head which sold from $6 to $8 each as to size and quality. The Boston Advertiser says: "We are given to understand that the export business is very changeable. Some steamers are loaded that bring owners a fair profit, while other lots are sold at a loss. Since January 1, the losses in shipping cattle to England have exceeded profits. We quote American cattle this week at a decline of ½ or 1 cent per lb dressed weight. There have been but few cattle lost on passage this season. Steamer Michigan that sailed from this port two weeks ago with 575 head, landed all but three head. Shipments were as follows: Steamer Roman, for Liverpool, sailed with 34 cattle for Gould & Morgan, 50 for T.

Introduced the Local Government Bill for England and Wales. An important feature of the proposal is the division of the whole country into urban and rural districts, within which women ratepayers will be equally entitled to vote for members of the councils. London will be created a county by itself under a lord-lieutenant. The Metropolitan Board of Works will be transformed into a council. The city will lose all administrative duties, and the whole police force will remain under the charge of the Home Office. Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, Bradford, Nottingham, Hull, and Newcastle will also constitute counties in themselves. Mr. Gladstone called attention to the entire absence in Mr. Bitchie's statement of any reference to Ireland. It was obvious, he said, that both Ireland and Scotland were specially excluded from the bill. Regarding the proposals now presented for England, there was every disposition on his side to treat them in a broad and candid spirit (Hear, hear). The proposals were too large to be criticized at once. The House must retain absolute liberty of judgment both as to the bill as a whole and as to the details (Hear, hear). Leave was therefore given to introduce the bill. 

The Blizzard in Britain, London, March 19. What is already known as the American blizzard has prevailed for two days past in the north of England. The telegrams from the north are almost as full of facts about snow ploughs, blockaded trains, deaths from exposure, etc., as if they were dated in Dakota. All the roads and railways about Sunderland are blocked. Seventeen trains are snowed up between Berwick and Newcastle. Seven feet of snow lies in the Durham roads. The Flying Southern is snowed up at Morpeth, and for a time, railway communication in the north is entirely suspended. Sheep have been frozen by the hundreds, and many people have been injured or killed by the storm, which, in many sections, in Westmoreland in particular, is the worst ever known. Some English etymologists working at the derivation of the word blizzard have concluded that it comes from the German Blitz (lightning). The journal Notes and Queries claims its English nationality, as the word has been known in the midland counties for 150 years in its present form, or as "bliz-er" or "blis-Bom," and as an oath, "May I be blizzard," which is common. 

The Courier, March 19 - Prince Bismarck had a long interview with the Prince of Wales prior to the latter's departure from Berlin. The Emperor Frederick, in bestowing the rank of field marshal upon Gen. Von Hildebrand, sent his own baton to the general with the request that he should use it until a new one is ready for him. The Emperor has resolved to send special envoys to all the reigning sovereigns to announce his accession to the throne. Gen. Von Loe accompanies the Prince of Wales as envoy to the English court. The Emperor has conferred the grand cross of the order of the Red Eagle upon Gen. Von Loe and Gen. Von Albedyll, and the order of the Black Eagle upon Gen. Von Schlotheim. Preparations are being made at Friedrichsruhe for the reception of Prince Bismarck next week. Prof. Bergmann paid a visit to the Emperor Frederick yesterday. He afterwards conferred with the other physicians. The Emperor gave a special audience today to the representatives of China, Japan, and Turkey. 

Snowstorm and Floods, March 19. The whole northern and eastern portion of Germany has been visited by a very severe snowstorm. There is so much ice that communication with Sweden has been suspended for ten days and with Denmark for six days. The Swedish envoys appointed to attend the funeral of Emperor William have not yet arrived. Disastrous floods are reported throughout Hungary. Thirty villages have been ruined, and the town of Szathmur-Nett has been partly destroyed. The towns of Békés and Czalá are menaced, and the inhabitants are struggling for their lives against the overflow of the River Koria. Many houses have fallen. 

Farms, March 19. A violent snowstorm is raging here this evening. All communication by railway with Lille and Havre has been cut off. Mails from Paris to Switzerland are snowed up. 

London, March 20. A heavy blizzard is raging in the southeast of England. The storm is slight in London. The storms in France and Germany continue. In Spain, the storm is very heavy, especially in the north. In the south of Spain, floods are doing enormous damage. 

The Dreadful Incident, Paris, March 19. 

18880321: D. McGibbon, advocate, of this city, who returned from New York City on Monday. Mr. McGibbon left Montreal on Sunday afternoon, March 11th, and was one of the passengers on the Montreal express which narrowly escaped the Chicago train at Dobbs Ferry, twenty miles from New York. Mr. McGibbon said the accident appeared to be the result of criminal carelessness on the part of the New York Central officials, and the serious results of the collision were utterly inexcusable. The accident occurred about 7 a.m., and at about 10, an engine and one car started south. In half an hour, the train came to a standstill at Mott Haven, further progress being impossible owing to the frightful blizzard prevailing. Mr. McGibbon and several other venturesome gentlemen left the train and ploughed their way on foot through the blinding snow to 138th Street and 3rd Avenue, where, after much difficulty, they secured an express driver who agreed to drive them to 42nd Street. "I have never seen such a snowstorm in Canada," said Mr. McGibbon. "The drifts were immense, and the wind, blowing across the island at the rate of over 60 miles an hour, punctuated the trip at each intersecting street in a very disagreeable way. Dozens of abandoned surface cars, cabs, sleighs, vans, and other vehicles impeded the avenue, and several times we saw pedestrians actually unable to extricate themselves from the drifts. Signs and awnings were flying on the wind in all directions. It occupied nearly three hours, and when we finally reached the Murray Hill Hotel, we were nearly exhausted, being lightly clad and totally unprepared for such inclemency. My fellow passengers who remained at Dobbs Ferry did not reach New York till Tuesday evening. The city was COMPLETELY PARALYZED by the storm. Tram cars were stopped, the elevated railway ceased running, hackmen wanted $50 to convey one any distance, and a general suspension of business supervened. The courts were closed; the Stock Exchange adjourned for the first time in its history; only two theatres were open on Monday night. One elevated train became stalled midway between 10th and 17th streets on the 6th Avenue line, and the passengers, unable to reach a station, were for four hours in the cars, which became colder and colder every minute. The native ingenuity of the American, however, came to the rescue, and a man with a long ladder placed it in position and announced to the frigid passengers that they could descend for $1 each. A number descended, and then the fare was lowered until it finally reached 25 cents when all got down. Several of my friends were on the train and naturally feel very proud of their unique experience. The downtown hotels reaped an immense harvest on Monday night, as many merchants and others who had gone downtown early in the morning were AFRAID TO VENTURE HOME at night and paid fabulous prices for beds for the night. One gentleman told me he paid $25 for a cot in a room with twelve others. On Tuesday," continued Mr. McGibbon, "the people went bravely to work, and that afternoon a few elevated cars were working. It was not until Thursday that the surface cars got started and railroad travel began. My own valise, which was checked in Montreal on Sunday afternoon, reached me on Thursday night, over four days from Montreal. In the meantime, supplies of provisions were giving out, and all the hotels were furnishing condensed milk to their guests. Several sad cases of people overcome by the storm and frozen to death have occurred. The good humor of New Yorkers was never more severely tried, and it came out triumphantly. Walking down Broadway on Tuesday evening, one saw on the immense piles of snow on the street signs with such legends as 'Please keep off the grass,' 'This snow for sale,' '$500 reward for the body of Jack Frost, dead or alive,' 'Marble quarry for sale,' 'Bathing suits to rent,' etc., planted in the beautiful snow. One florist had decorated the mountain in front of his establishment with his choicest flowers, and a sign 'The flowers that bloom in the snow.' Pedestrians in grotesque costumes were unmercifully challenged by street gamins, and snowballing seemed to be indulged in with impunity. On Wednesday, the courts got to work and the sidewalks were clear by Thursday, though the streets are frightful and the crossings DANGEROUSLY MUDDY. The storm seems to have demonstrated the absolute necessity for underground railways and also for underground telegraph and telephone service. In Montreal, we ride over a snowstorm, but in New York, they burrow through it. People were consuming the snow by means of bonfires and by steam hose, and occasionally humbler citizens would be seen pouring hot water from the domestic kettle on the ice-covered pavement. The street department of New York deserves praise, in my opinion, for their efforts, but I certainly prefer Montreal to New York in a blizzard." Before our reporter left, Mr. McGibbon said that an edict from our Police Department should be promulgated enforcing not only the removal of all snow from our sidewalks, but also the digging of a gutter at once. If this were done, our pavements would be much safer than they are. 

MUSIC AND THE DRAMA

18880322: "WESTERN WAFTINGS. The Daily Fundset of News from the Prairie Province. Winnipeg, March 21. A farmer from Manitoulin Island is at Medicine Hat spying out a location for a number of the islanders who want to remove to the Northwest. The tail end of the New York blizzard struck here yesterday, but has only slightly interfered with railway traffic. The case of Mack Howes, charged with forgery, has been postponed to the next assizes owing to his illness. Judge Dubuc was presented with a pair of white gloves by the sheriff at the opening of the Brandon assizes, there being no criminal cases. It is reported that the provincial police force will be disbanded and only two or three detectives retained in connection with the Attorney-General's department. Harry Jennings, manager of Brett's sanitarium at Banff, skipped yesterday with $700 of the doctors' money. The Speaker of the Legislature met himself today and adjourned until tomorrow. 

CONFEDERATION WILL WIN In Newfoundland if Terms are Favorable, But Only After a Bitter Fight (From our own correspondent), St. John's, Nfld, March 21. Premier Thorburn arrived today. The mail steamer had to land her mails in the Bay of Bulls owing to the ice pack at the entrance of the harbor. It is expected a deputation on Confederation will leave soon for Ottawa, and that Premier Thorburn, Attorney-General Winter, and Sir 

18880326: 30. The estimated receipts were 8,000, against yesterday's official 15,045, with shipments of 5,031. There were left over from yesterday about 5,500. The receipts for the week were 85,508, with shipments of 30,000. There were packed to date 170,000, against 103,000 at the same time last year. The receipts of cattle were 1,000 head. The Cincinnati Price Current says: "There has been a more liberal marketing of hogs the past week, and packing operations have been larger than during the corresponding time last year, with but little complaint as to quality of hogs, as compared with other seasons at this time of the year. At the nine leading points, the packing for the week has been 137,000 hogs, against 100,000 last year, and since March, a total of 310,000, against 332,000 a year ago. Other points have packed about the same number as for the corresponding time last year in the aggregate. Prices of hogs were somewhat reduced during the week, but are firmer at the close at about the same position as a week ago. At Chicago, the average price of hogs is about the same as a year ago, the range not being as wide as then; here at Cincinnati, the average is 15-20 cents per 100 lbs lower than a year ago, and for all the Western centers now opening, the general average is probably but little different from a year ago. In the provision trade, there is the usual movement of product to consuming districts, orders being generally restricted to current needs, and not reflecting apprehensions of any quick upward turn in values in the near future. Better indications as to foreign needs are being shown, although this is not yet made apparent in the clearances. Last week's exports were small, but were interfered with by the storm at the seaboard. English shippers are taking liberal quantities of pickled meats from Western markets." 

Local Provisions. A fair amount of business was done in local provisions for a Saturday.

Hogs: The demand for hogs was quiet and the market was steady, business being of a small jobbing character. We quote $7.50 a $7.75 per 100 lbs.

Ashes: There was no change in ashes, the market being quiet and steady. We quote first pots $4.25 a $4.30, pearls $7.30, and second do $3.00 per 100 lbs.

Eggs: The egg market opened strong under a good demand, and in the forenoon mostly all the offerings were taken at an advance of 1¢ at 18¢ cash. Later in the day, supply became very light, and buyers could not fill their wants, and the market ruled much stronger and active with some sales at 20¢, but later in the afternoon the receipts were larger and the market eased off, closing sales being made at 18¢ a 20¢ per dozen.

In another column, we reprint an article from the Toronto Canadian Grocer, together with extracts from the Toronto Empire on the same subject.

Butter: There was nothing of interest in the butter market, business being quiet and confined to local wants at unchanged prices. The New York Commercial Bulletin says: The delayed stock of butter began to come in rapidly early in the week, and though demand was considerably interfered with by the blockades of snow in the streets, making trucking so difficult, still most of the local trade had run down very close, and the outlet was about enough to take the increased supply promptly and freely sustain the higher prices established last week. As the snow disappeared, the demand increased, and an active call came from out-of-town points, mostly for under grades, from 25¢ down, which relieved the market of most of the accumulations of both fresh and held stock. For a day or two past, the movement in fine grades has been moderate, and with the bulk of current supply being of such quality, there has been a little surplus, and the tone is weaker on grades from 27¢ to 28¢ up to 32¢. In fact, the latter has become extreme for Elgin and Pennsylvania, and 30¢ for other Western, but anything from 26¢ to 29¢ down is in light supply and held firmly and with confidence. State dairy new tubs ruled firm at 30¢ early in the week, but that is extreme at the close, though good quality sells readily. In the Western packings, all grades have been in moderate supply, good demand, and firm.

Creamery Townships: Morrisburg 19, Brockville 17, Western 17.

Cheese: Cheese continued quiet but firm, with the market unchanged. Cable 50s50s. The New York Commercial Bulletin of today's date says: "Cheese does not appear to have suffered any damage from the blizzard, but on the contrary, since the enforced rest of last week, the market has steadily gained both in the volume of trade and strength of values. Indeed, there is a positive recovery in price, established through actual sales, and the gain seems to be very well supported thus far, though a noticeable tendency to assume a mildly excited and buoyant position in some quarters is rather overdrawing matters and calculated to mislead. The business transacted has been of a very general character, commencing down among the Pennsylvania skims and running up through the State whole and part skims, and then into full cream stocks, with a great many of the latter costing from 10¼ to 11½¢ taken by exporters, who have also ventured to a moderate extent among the fancies, for which they made further bids. A great deal of the fancy stock, however, has simply changed hands between dealers, with one or two lots supposed to have been absorbed as a protective measure until the new owners' tone became convinced that quotations should be marked up to conform to what they ask. The regular spring game has in fact set in, and variable ideas of value even on specific grades may be expected until cheese has all sold out. The actual distribution on home account has been growing, but the principal feature of encouragement was the increased amounts handled by exporters. There does not appear to have been anything new to start up trade except a run of orders of larger volume than usual, though some dealers have been approached with more or less frequency, suggesting the propriety of consigning parcels of colored stock, but few, if any, consented. White cheese is in very small compass, and if the current belief that two or three shippers are anxious to get some of it holds, the chances are in favor of pretty high rates. At the close, the general feeling appears quite firm and cheerful, with holders in better humor than for some time past. Advices at hand indicate that nearly all factories in Western New York and many in the central section of the State have commenced work. The exports now indicated are 11,000 boxes, of which 4,500 are through "c c."

Finest September and October 10¢ & 11½¢. Fine 10¢ & 10½¢. Finest August 10¼¢. Fine 10¢. Medium 8¢.

THE EASTERN MARKET

1888-03-29: JESS There was a good demand for eggs, and the market was active, with a good business doing. The offerings were fair and prices were steady at 20¢ a 21¢ per dozen.

Butter: There has been no change in the character of the butter market, which has remained quiet, with trade limited to local wants. Finest table goods have a fair sale, but low grades are easy. 

Creamery Townships: Morrisburg 19, Brockville 17, Western 17.

Cheese: Cheese has a quiet but firm tone, and practically speaking, the whole interest of trade is centered on the other side, there being little stock left for sale here. The New York Commercial Bulletin says: "Fancy white in particular shows up stiff on value, aided by a fractional advance in the cable quotation and an apparent desire on the part of most holders to reserve their supplies for domestic use. Advices at hand by mail indicate an awakening of interest among some of the out-of-town customers, as a result of the recent advance; and this, it is hoped, will lead to a better trade at no distant date."

The Dairy Markets: The cheese market did not experience any bad results from the recent blizzard. On the contrary, the enforced quiet seemed to give a swing to the trade both in volume and prices. The amounts handled by exporters increased considerably, and the chances appear to be in favor of a good advance in prices. Nearly all of the factories in western New York commenced work last week, and many of those in the central section. One New York house took 2,500 boxes last week, an approximating amount including 1,700 boxes of colored, and a third is credited with 1,500 boxes. As all these buyers are large jobbers and not given to investing unless they have good assurance that trade will warrant it, the market looks very favorable on all accounts. The higher prices established in butter were freely sustained last week. The firmer grades are not in good demand, however, as stock from 25¢ to 26¢, which sells very readily. Thirty-two cents has become extreme for Elgin. New dairy tubs were firm at 30¢ at the beginning of the week, but at the close the price was extreme. The following is the usual table of cheese quotations: 

Receipts: Exp 11,510 March 27, March 20, March 23, 1880 13,024 1887 11,1888 11,970. Price, 12¢. 

Cable 50s (3s, 50s col, 50s wh). March 27, 1880, March 20, 1887, March 25, 1888. 

Cheese is again a subject of interest here, as it is in all cheese sections. Factory men and cheese buyers are discussing the probabilities of the opening of the market, which will soon occur here. It is the general opinion that prices will not start as high as they did last year. For the corresponding day last year, one small lot of cheese was delivered here, but no price was fixed upon it. On April 4, the Hasenelver factory sold a lot of 30 boxes of full cream cheese at 13¢. Some believe that prices this year will start at least 2¢ lower for the same grade of goods. Probably three-fourths of the factories are now in operation, and nearly all are receiving milk once a day. By the first of April, all will be in operation. We learn of resales of the late fall cheese here during the past week, by dealers, of about 450 boxes, at 11½¢ a 12¢.

Utica Herald

1888-03-31: N.Y., March 30. The Marietta Final Home of this city summarizes its crop reports from all sections of the country as follows: Winter wheat is in the most backward condition of any spring in the past five years. During February and March, this belt has had ample surface rains, but very general lack of sunshine. March has been a general disappointment to farmers, and practically no farm work has been done. In Dakota, there will be less spring wheat sown than usual, although in northern Dakota, the ground is in fair condition. Minnesota has had severe blizzards, and with the most favorable weather, spring seeding will be very late. The trying March weather has also lightened the prospects of the anticipated large average of oats. Last year, the bulk of the crop was seeded at this date, while this year nothing has been done. Further backward weather will tend to greatly cut the crop of oats short. In California, seeding is practically over, and conditions are generally good. Texas has had abundant rains, and promises the finest crop of winter wheat in her history. In Tennessee and Kentucky, the promising crop has been seriously injured by the Minnesota blizzard. The same is true, only more so, in the wheat centers of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Michigan has been more protected by snow, and in Kansas, the prospect is good. Crops are suffering only from lack of reserves of moisture. Missouri promises a fair average crop. Canada has been well protected, and her present condition is all that could be desired.

Defendant: No, sir, I'm a journalist.

A Final Opinion: 
Old Man (to daughter): Clara, I discovered Nero Mug dead in the yard this morning. 
Daughter: I am very sorry, papa, but I cannot help it. You know very well that young Mr. Harvard was coming to see me last night, and you should have tied the dog out of his way.

The Rotary

The rotary snow plough, which was recently placed on the Huntingdon and Dakota road, is now clearing the line. It was started out at five o'clock yesterday morning with a crew under the charge of Zach Cowles, superintendent of rotary power of the Milwaukee system. The company is so well pleased with the rotary plough that each division of the road will be provided with one next winter. This one, which was the eleventh and last one made last summer, cost the Milwaukee company $15,000, and it is calculated that it has already paid for itself by the work done in half a dozen or so trips over the division. The plough reached Bird Island at one o'clock yesterday afternoon. There was no interruption to the splendid time made to that point. The drifts were not quite so heavy as had been expected. At very many places between Glencoe and Bird Island the drifts were five and six feet high, and several hundred feet long, but these did not tax the capacity of the wheel. The snow was light, however. The rotary is quite a stupendous affair, weighing fifty-three tons, with two gauges of water in the boilers. The boilers are made to stand 175 pounds of steam. The front wheel is nine feet in diameter and cuts an opening of thirteen feet. The snow is thrown from 25 to 100 feet.

The Five Hundred

Young Ah Cum led us first to the temple of Five Hundred Genii, and followed by some sixty ragged and dirty boys, who seemed to have sprung out of the paving stones at the gateway, we went through a stone-paved court and into the lofty chamber of the temple. The Five Hundred were all there, sitting in a gilded row around the wall and on long cross pieces extending into the middle space. At one end of the room was a railed altar space with a gilded image of the Emperor Kien Lung in a gilded shrine, with candles, paper flowers, and smouldering incense sticks set before him. A horrible priest, with hard round eyes rolling from side to side craftily, like a beast of prey, an unpleasant smile that disclosed a double row of ferocious-looking white teeth, and a stealthy, cat-like tread, with pauses in it like something crouching for a spring, presided over the altar. There was the same creepy feeling and fascination in watching him as in watching snakes in a museum. One drew back when the priest came near, and if he had touched one of us, we were all agreed that we would have to shriek, except one brave tourist, who threatened to break his umbrella in self-defense first. Our guide was exact and conscientious, and he insisted upon marching us around the temple until we had faced every one of the Five Hundred, many of whom had whiskers and hair of bright Prussian blue. One wears a black sailor hat and passes as the image of Marco Polo, but without the least authority, scholars say. This temple is the place of worship of the Flowery Forest Monastery, but the forest was not visible, and the one cut-like, tigerish, snaky-eyed priest was the only one of the brotherhood visible.

1888-04-04: 

D. Fauquier, who had been admitted to Holy Orders in 1840 by Bishop Strachan, held for twenty-eight years the incumbency of West Zorra. Bishop Fauquier was consecrated on the 28th of October, 1873, and labored earnestly and successfully until his death in December, 1881. That event, which came upon his clergy and people with startling suddenness, left the scattered missions of the vast diocese without a head. The interval between the loss of the deeply regretted Dr. Fauquier and the acceptance of the charge by Bishop Sullivan was a time of suspense and trial. The Rev. Mr. Wilson did all that experience and zeal could prompt to make up for the deficiency, but even he was beginning to despair when Dr. Sullivan undertook the task of continuing Dr. Fauquier's work. He entered on his labors in 1882, and what progress has been made since then, those who have read his printed reports or who have heard accounts of that great mission field from his own lips have not to be informed. But it is impossible for missions, any more than any other enterprise, to succeed without money, and the lack of pecuniary support has been all along the main drawback to the progress of Algoma. We have the Bishop's own testimony to the liberality of the church people of the diocese. They are not, as a rule, wealthy, but they contribute as much as their circumstances permit them to do. 

It is the other dioceses, the well-to-do dioceses that... I have failed to do their duty. So firmly convinced is Dr. Sullivan of their laxness that he does not hesitate to charge them with lack of interest in missions, as compared with the members of other churches. It is for them to consider whether they have left themselves open to such a charge or have really done all in their power. In the latter case, no more can be expected of them, and the missionary diocese of Algoma must be pronounced a failure. Need we say that such a result of fifteen years' struggle would not be to the credit of the Church of England in Canada? We have again and again pointed out the connection between missions and colonization, and how much the success of the latter depends upon the generous support of the former. The Anglican Church of the ecclesiastical province of Canada is bound by solemn engagement to act fairly by Bishop Sullivan and his diocese. It is to be hoped, then, for many reasons, that His Lordship's appeal will not have been made in vain.

A very serious crisis has been averted in the United States by the action of the railroad operatives yesterday in resolving to forego their intention of striking on all railroads handling cars or freight from the Burlington & Quincy line. Though it looks much like a backdown on the part of the men, and no doubt required a good deal of moral courage, the course they have adopted is the best, especially for the laboring classes, whose loss from the disorganization of the business of the country from even a week's continuance of such a struggle as was spoken of would have been of such overwhelming extent as to a hundred times over offset the gain of the locked-out men on the Burlington road, even if success had rewarded their sacrifices. The lessons of recent great strikes are evidently having their effect.

The Winnipeggers must have something to agitate about. The Hudson River Valley matter is hardly settled before there begin to appear signs that the next thing there will be a newspaper blizzard over the Hudson's Bay railroad, coupled with all sorts of demands upon the governments, federal and provincial. The history of that road is the evidence of Winnipeg's instability of purpose. About two years ago there was a craze on for a short northern route to Europe. The contract was given out—there is always a contract in view when Winnipeg is excited—and within a couple of months some forty miles of roadbed were constructed parallel, most of it, to an existing line. And there it was left, and yet remains, never having been operated. The coming agitation will perhaps see trains started on it, and then will come a switch off to some other excitement.

There is every probability that Russian intrigue is at its most active stage just now in Romania, and that the ministerial crisis, resulting in Mr. M. Cristian's resignation, within three weeks after the formation of his cabinet and within a few days after a strong vote of confidence, was due to that influence. The treaty of alliance concluded with Austria is a rebuff which the Czar is not likely to endure with patience. The enmity of Romania would be a serious obstacle to Russian success in case of war. In 1877, but for the assistance of the little Roumanian army, the Russian invaders would have been virtually destroyed by the forces of the Sultan. The alliance of King Charles is, therefore, of grave moment to the Czar, in case of war, which is, as the Bulgarian question now stands, unhappily only too possible. For this reason, Muscovite agents will naturally halt at no measure that may defeat the anti-Russian party in the Romanian kingdom, and that they are busily at work at the present moment is almost certain.

Our Newfoundland correspondent's letter today discusses the prospect of the confederation proposal in the island colony. The condition of the people is depleted, their feeling towards the sea described, and the forces working for and against it detailed. It is quite evident there will be a powerful opposition to Confederation, even if the terms are made much more advantageous than the interests of the Dominion can warrant. The mercantile railway would fight anything that was likely to affect their control of the island's markets, are arrayed against it and will exert a great force in the contest at the polls that will decide the matter. They have also the assistance of a number of public men, some of them members of the government. In favor of the scheme are men foremost on both sides of politics—the fact that the country under present conditions is not prospering, and the desire to get rid of the French shore difficulty, which Canada should insist on being settled before assuming responsibility for the government of the colony. The struggle will evidently be a hard one, though our correspondent thinks it will end in the defeat of the antis.

Although for obvious reasons, several of the European governments thought it their duty to decline an invitation, the acceptance of which might be construed into an unqualified approval of the French Revolution, it is not for that reason to be concluded that the nations of Europe will refrain from participation in the exhibition. In Great Britain, it appears that preparations are being steadily pushed on by leading manufacturing and mercantile firms for due representation at Paris next year. The Times some time ago pointed out that the refusal of the government to take action furnished all the more reason for a display of zeal and energy on the part of private persons. A meeting was held at the Mansion House about a fortnight since, with the object of effecting such organization as may be necessary to secure a creditable illustration of England's industrial skill and progress. It would be very do, the Times urges, for Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, Leeds, and the other manufacturing towns of England to make no figure on an occasion when Lyons, Liege, Rouen, and other industrial centers of the continent will be showing to advantage. Belgium is also making similar preparations to be fully represented.

There having been a report that certain foreign nationals had settled in Cork and had been persecuted by some of the artisans of that city, the mayor of Cork, Mr. John O'Brien, has written to the Times to contradict the statement. He acknowledges that, at a time when work is scarce and many are suffering from want, the feeling prevails that it is hard for workingmen to have, as they think, the bread taken out of their mouths by the immigration of a number of refugees. But he denies, in strong terms, that the Jews in question were molested in Cork. Dissatisfaction prevailed at the attempt to introduce convict labor, but the foreigners who had headed that movement were not of the Jewish faith. The wanderers who had been driven to the shores of Ireland by ill treatment in their native country had the sympathy of the Irish people, so many of whom know what it was to suffer hardship and to be strangers in a strange land. Mr. O'Brien thought, however, that it would have been more judicious if the influential leaders of the Jewish community in London, the most powerful body for its numbers in the world, had diverted their coreligionists from trying their fortunes in a country like Ireland which had difficulty enough to maintain its own population.

The Rutherford people who have adopted resolutions against the formation of the territories into provinces are unquestionably in the right, though we believe there is no present intention of taking such a step. Our system of ministries responsible to the legislature is much too cumbersome and costly in its operation for such small populations as it would be applied to in the Northwest for years to come. The less complicated and costly the government machinery provided, the better. Representative institutions as we have them in Canada are ill-suited for small populations. They give a fictitious importance to the position of those who administer the government, and create an unhealthy competition for place that leads to such agitations as that conducted by the Farmers' Union in Manitoba a few years ago and later by the Hudson's Bay and Red River railroad contract seekers. They create a semblance of political party division when no ground for them exists in anything pertaining to the country and so cause a waste of public energy that might be better employed. This has been the experience in the past, and to avoid it in the future it might be a wise course to definitely fix the number of inhabitants a territory should possess before it was raised to the rank of a province, and the number should not be a small one either. Such a course might prevent much future misunderstanding.

M. Corriely has prophesied peril to France through the vote that the Republic has marked out for General Boulanger. He reminds his readers that he raised his voice against that demagogue of the charioteers two years ago, when Republicans were applauding him. He warned them that they had entered on the path of danger but they would not listen. He told them that Boulanger was a general of the circus, a warrior of the streets, a soldier of the mob, and that he would one day cause them trouble. But they laughed in his face. They gave Boulanger carte blanche to defy all authority and discipline, to set duty at naught as an obsolete tradition, and he did so and became the idol of the multitude. Now they have harshly rebuked him and the insurrectionists cry out "treason!" In vain the Opportunists retort that Logerot did right in putting down a soldier in command who had taught and practiced insubordination. "We are on the side of the national defense, and Boulanger is its champion," says one faction. "We are the advocates of military discipline," says the other faction, "and Boulanger was ruining it." But it is for that only reason that he is the darling of the mob, and M. Corriely, little as he likes or respects him, is forced to believe that Boulanger's future is assured. He is the necessary product of a system which introduced politics into the army. Ten years ago the army was an army of soldiers who knew how to obey, of officers who knew how both to obey and to command. An outcry was raised by the populace because it was not Republican enough, and an induced legislature yielded to the outcry. The discipline was contemned, and now those who continued it are asking for sympathy from the people in their onslaught against the man who did their bidding. But it is too late! That man has got to be the bridge of them.

Hon. George Brown, who is attending Cambridge University, was a member of the rowing crew which defeated Oxford. The Canadian did it! The New York Athletic Club thinks it has made a big step in securing William Farmer and Charles H. Sherrill, the two Yale champions, as members. The club will be represented by them in all the games this season. "Just why some clubs are making such efforts to get left-handed pitchers puzzles me," said Captain Hanlon. "For my part, I would sooner have a good right-hand man, as he will outlast the other every time." So confident are many of the league pitchers that this is going to be the pitchers' year and that there will be little batting done, that some of them are making wagers that few batsmen will reach 100 at the end of the season. Some of the members of the Hamilton Bicycle Club, accompanied by members of the Cricket Association, visited the cricket grounds on Saturday and had a surveyor go over the proposed asphalt track. It is almost certain now that the track will be built at a cost of about $1,000. Hamilton. The "Spider" looks like a millionaire coal mine owner with a fondness for horses and sports in general. Last night he wore his "new sporty-looking" shirt with red, white, and blue stripes, a fur-trimmed overcoat (which is so popular in the height of the blizzards), striped, skin-tight trousers, and a pair of patent shoes. 

A Forktown admirer of Mickey Jones, Hamilton's left-handed twirler, says: "Begorra, ye can talk about yer Johnny Wards and yer Mike Kellys, and all them other big 'uns, but that boy Mickey Jones is a daisy and no mistake. He can run around that square more times, throw more balls, and put out more men than any one of them. Mark that!" 

Mail: George A. Leitner, of last year's Indianapolis club, graduated as an M.D. last week. He was second in a class of 144 from Bellevue Hospital. The same week he was a successful applicant for the position of assistant physician at St. Francis Hospital, New York City. Leitner has received some fine offers to pitch this season, but this appointment prevents him from playing ball.

18880407: II. Small, Ottawa, was read. It dealt with the various theories accounting for this phenomenon, leaning to that which supposes it due to meteoric matter in the space between the sun and the earth's orbit. President Smith communicated two papers. One, written in answer to an inquiry put by a member at a former meeting, briefly explained "The Cause of Blizzards in the American Northwest," and showed why the Canadian territories were usually exempt from their disastrous fury. The second paper dealt at length with "Chaldean Astronomy and its Connection with Modern Symbolism," and illustrated the origin of many popular superstitions and customs connected with the existing calendar, besides explaining the probable origin of the symbols now used in astronomy.

18880409: "A MIDNIGHT RUN" Serious Fire in Rev. Smythe's Residence This Morning. An alarm was sounded at 12:30 this morning from box 50, corner of Fulford and Coursol streets, for a fire which broke out in the residence of Rev. Dr. Smythe, 387 St. Antoine street, caused by a lamp having exploded in the study, where that gentleman was reading at the time. Reels from 6, 10, and 12 were quickly upon the spot, and after an hour's dexterous work the fire was extinguished, but not before damage was done to the extent of about $1,000, it is estimated. All the furniture in the study, together with a large collection of books in the library, besides some valuable sermons, were destroyed. Dr. Smythe had his hands and head burnt. Seven covers were used by the Salvage Corps in saving the remainder of the furniture, which was insured, but it is not yet known if the house was also insured. 

A THESPIAN QUEEN GONE: Miss Lilian Olcott Dies Suddenly in a New York Hotel. New York, April 8. Lilian Olcott, the well-known actress, died at the Westminster Hotel at 10 o'clock this morning, of inflammation of the bowels. She engaged a room at the hotel about two weeks ago, and on Wednesday last called in a physician, to whom she said that she was suffering from a cold contracted during the blizzard. On Thursday she was feeling better, but yesterday her illness took an unfavorable turn and she sank rapidly. Her maid was her only companion at the hotel, and she asked the physician not to announce her illness to her parents lest it might worry them. Miss Olcott's father, Dr. Olcott, of Brooklyn, was promptly notified of his daughter's death, and with his wife came to the hotel. The body was removed to Dr. Olcott's residence in Brooklyn.

18880410: L. Weston shows two small pictures: "Evening Montreal Harbor" (137), both of them delicately executed and little gems in their way. They are both well worth inspection and much more than a passing glance. "A Blizzard" (107) by Miss Lida H. Lumb is a representation of the blinding snows beating about a country residence. It is realistically done. "A Study of Lilacs" (127) by Miss Zuleika M. Lambe is an ambitious coloring and it is successful. The leaves are very cleverly drawn and the colors artistically contrasted. It is creditable.

18880412: W. Horn, Newport, are registered at the Balmoral. Miscellaneous Items: Robinson Brown says that you owe him $15. Duniley (indignantly): "I do not owe Brown a cent! I did owe him $15, but the debt became outlawed last week. Any man who will lie like he does ought not to be trusted." 

A Rockland man who owned a cow made a bargain with a butcher to kill and sell it on commission. It so happened that the first offer the butcher received for the meat was from the owner of the cow, who did not recognize the carcass. Three-quarters of the meat was sold to him for five cents a pound, and he afterward sold it again at a small profit. The next day he bought the remaining quarter, beating the accommodating butcher down on his price, and sold that quarter for a small profit. When he settled with the butcher for his own cow, he was indignant that the meat man sold it so cheap and was dumbfounded when he heard that he himself was the purchaser. Rockland (Me.) Courier-Gazette. A gentleman was in town last week whose wits stood him in good stead during the blizzard. He was snow-bound at Osontn, N...

18880414: COMMUNICATIONS: LEGISLATION AND RAILWAY BRAKES. To the Editor of the Gazette: On the subject of protection to railway employees and the second reading of the bill at Ottawa, Mr. Shanly suggests that the Westinghouse brake should be adopted in all freight and passenger cars in Canada. Where is our National Policy and its benefit to patentees and manufacturers when we are asked to give a monopoly to a foreign company for an article which can be had here of a superior description and much more effective in its action? I do not depreciate the value of the Westinghouse brake in its own place, but I smile at its action when the thermometer is down among the thirties in a drifting blizzard or snowstorm. At less than a fifth of the cost of the Westinghouse, a train can be fitted with a much more simple and effective automatic brake, the work of our own country, and already patented here and in the States. Among its many superior qualities are: No steam, no rubber couplings; brakes can be applied from any part of the train or by the engineer; it is not affected by the weather, or liable to get out of order; stops a train in its own length; if a coupling pin breaks, the train is immediately stopped by the automatic working of the brake; does not skin the wheels, etc. These are but a few of its many advantages and improvements, and if the railway companies grant the necessary cars, the test can be made at once.

18880418: A VICTIM OF THE BLIZZARD. Emperor Frederick in Much the Same Condition, Great Improvement Perceptible. New York, April 17. Roscoe Conkling is dying, probably will be dead before this is read. Several times today did the report of the end come, but each time only to be contradicted. The turn for the worse began at 12:30 p.m. when he developed edema of the lungs, that is the settling of the blood in the base of the lungs. At 5:20 p.m., Dr. Anderson said Mr. Conkling was fast passing away and did not think he would survive the night. Mrs. Conkling and Mrs. Oakman are with him. At 6:00 p.m., Dr. Barker issued his official bulletin: "Mr. Conkling is failing fast. His lungs are fast filling up with blood, owing to the failure of the heart which has resulted from the gradual wasting away of his vital powers." Dr. Barker would not say definitely how long Mr. Conkling can live, but he says he cannot possibly survive the night. Dr. Fordyce Barker seemed quite overcome as he stood on the steps of Mr. Conkling's house this afternoon and told the reporters of the impending dissolution of his patient. The sad news spread rapidly in the Hoffman House and was telegraphed rapidly by wire to a sorrowing country. There was a hush in the corridors of the hotel nearby and a pervading oppressive quiet and solemnity, and all voices were subdued. The friends who came to make a last call went away with sorrowful faces. 

A victim of THE BLIZZARD. The doctors have based their hopes exclusively on the patient's splendid physique. Putting this magnificent physique to a severe test during the blizzard of March 12 is said to be the very cause of Mr. Conkling's illness. Mr. Conkling delighted in telling the story of his struggle through the snow on that evening when he walked from his office to his home. For two weeks afterwards he continued to work, and at last, on March 30, had to succumb. On April 3rd he called in Dr. Agnew, and on the 4th, Dr. Sands, after consultation, determined on performing one of the most delicate operations known to surgical science. Physical diagnosis proved that a pus sac lay inside the skull back of the ear. In the operation, the rather awkward trephine was dispensed with in order to give vent to the pus, which, doubtless, bore on the brain. Dr. Sands made a lateral incision in the scalp, and then, with a sharp chisel placed on the exposed mastoid bone, with one sharp stroke of a mallet, the chisel was sent right through the bone. Pus freely flowed and the fever was reduced. Temporary relief followed. All the afternoon the sick statesman lay motionless in his bed. He occasionally moved his arms which were under the bed covering. He lay on his right side in order that the wound on the left side of his head might not get irritated. This cut, it will be understood, is the one Dr. Sands made when he operated in his endeavor to save the ex-Senator's life. Dr. Barker called at 10:05 o'clock and remained until 11 o'clock. He said that Mr. Conkling was failing rapidly. His extremities were becoming cold, his legs were quite cold nearly all the way up. He was pulseless. His respiration was very quick. He did not think Mr. Conkling could live much longer. In fact, he did not think he would live for two hours. He was suffering from a general failure of the nervous system. At 11:30 p.m., Dr. Barker said of Senator Conkling: "No pulse, limbs cold, respiration slight, unconscious, will die in three hours." At 2 a.m., a similar report came from the sick room.

18880426: SOCIETY TALK IN GOTHAM Some New Effects in Ladies' Dresses and Headgear Clear Impressions of a Recent Dramatic Success at the Lyceum New York, April 25 My last letter reached you just as we were suffering from our ever-to-be-remembered blizzard, a storm which made this great New York in very truth a beleaguered city. Streets were blockaded, supplies cut off, men separated from their families, telegraph and railroad communication denied us, and life disrupted, and all by the beautiful snow. No wonder a French paper had a notice saying "a fearful epidemic was raging in America called the blizzards, and many people were dying of it." We know not how many impaired their health in trying to battle with that storm, but we do know that one of America's best-known statesmen has succumbed and on Saturday was buried. I remember seeing Roscoe Conkling on one occasion and thinking what an indomitable expression he had; it was that fearlessness in his nature which made him think he was safe in defying the elements. The grand old Kaiser is gone, the blizzard too, and Roscoe Conkling, to be followed too soon by the death of the patient, gentle, and wise Emperor Frederick. How filled the last two weeks have been with startling events! Spring weather alone seems tardy in approaching and makes one lose sight of the beauties in Kingsley's remarkable "Ode to the Northeast Wind." Easter calls for spring attire, and usually brings fitting weather with well-fitting costumes. Elegant tailor-made suits are in season for spring when it is not winter, and though the sun shines warmly, the wind is wintry. I was looking out of a window on Broadway, on Saturday last, when there suddenly came up a fierce snowstorm, lasting only a few moments, but long enough to see an amusing destruction and flight of much spring finery. In a moment, cabs, streetcars, and shops were taken advantage of. The day was too cold and bright to expect rain, and few were provided with umbrellas. The new dress goods are lovely this season, and checks and plaids are seen in great variety and of every texture, and are to be had in costumes, but the more elegant ones are made of the new fine Henrietta cloths combined with moire, broadcloth, or silk of the same color, many with a scarf drapery crossing the front and looped low down on one side, knotted and brought up again, the waist and back drapery being polonaise and braided, but of a contrasting color. Changeable silks with pinked flounces, and many of them (the flounces) are seen in imported dresses; these silks are in startling combinations, orange and blue, green and yellow, etc. They are a revival of the old-fashioned silks. Why they should have been called that I cannot imagine, unless it be that if one got shot, one's colors would be sure to get mixed. There are some daring uses being made of pink broadcloth. Whether these dresses will see daylight in the street has yet to be proved. I saw an odd wrap or street dress for a girl of 12 or 13 of mahogany brown and braided with hempen rope, common clothes line size. By the way, rope has many uses now-a-days not thought of a decade ago, and plays an important part in house decoration, is raveled into fringe, ties back curtains and makes very handsome picture and screen frames if tacked upon a common board frame and painted with gold paint, after first sizing with glue; in fact, any furniture can be ornamented with rope and painted over. Another way to do picture frames, and one I thought of myself, is to stretch a piece of coarse flowered net or embroidered muslin over a plain wooden frame, fasten into each corner a china doll, cupid or angel, or bird if you like, and color the same as the rope ones. Bonnets are presenting an improved back view, and like the new houses are front all around. In holding the new bonnets in the hand one can almost believe they could be worn either way. Bows of ribbon are placed upon the crown standing up as they did in the front a month ago, and on the top of the bonnet rests a cluster of flowers, or feathers, or lace with pretty ornaments. Hats are of every shape and material, the straws being finer than last season. One I noticed was of pink lace, having a bunch of roses so arranged as to appear standing in a bowl with a climbing rose stem going under the rim and bordering the face. Some sunshades are elaborately trimmed with feathers; in fact, I have seen some completely covered. I noticed a pretty tea gown of India silk, white ground with apple blossoms and leaves, gathered at the neck, then from just below the armholes to below the waist, the skirt falling full all around, the front filled in with fan-shaped flowers of soft Mechlin lace, with many ribbon bows of apple, pink, and green; the sleeves were gathered at the armhole and below the elbow, and finished with a frill of lace and bows. Braiding is very popular, mixed with tinsel, and often vests, cuffs, and collars of white broadcloth are covered with this handsome braiding. If the weather permitted, one might imagine summer was here from the abundance of fruit, fresh vegetables, and flowers to be seen. Purple lilacs abound and are sold in great bunches for 20 cents. For some time, spiritualism has been much talked about, and at present, the Marsh-Diss Debar case is much discussed, as one of the most extraordinary incidents of infatuation or hallucination, to give it a mild term, ever known. Mr. Marsh, a man advanced in years, a lawyer, educated and intelligent, believed implicitly in the woman who duped him, robbed him of property, reputation, and reason—a woman whose counsel have declared they can no longer defend her, so disgusted are they with her course, and it is said there are very grave charges of another kind to be brought against her, and she may wear a necklace more elastic than the diamonds she offers her counsel to get her out of this trouble. I know a case myself in New York of a maiden lady of the certain age of fifty or more, who was rich, luxury-loving, bright, and intelligent, until she became imbued with spiritualistic ideas, when a swindling man of spiritualistic calling gained such power over her that he robbed her of all her worldly goods, deprived her of the necessaries of life, and so dimmed her reason that she was willing to render up her life, too, if called upon. Monopolies are legislated against, and outrages of every character publicly exposed. May spiritualists get their deserts and their charlatanism be openly condemned and merited punishment follow. The ever-popular Lyceum still holds crowded houses spellbound with its splendid society play, "The Wife." I cannot tell when I have enjoyed a play more or seen such uniformly good acting by a whole company. The mounting of the play is rich and attractive, the house is unique, the dressing superb, and the acting all that can be desired. In this drama more than any other I can think of, the eloquence of silence is truly experienced. I have not space to more fully describe the ultimate thule of the Lyceum and "The Wife." I only ask you to see for yourself this delightful play, which illustrates many phases in life, and shows the nobility of soul possessed by true men, all that is sordid, cruel, and unscrupulous in the untrained man, and that Cupid can make a brave soldier tremble when the cry of battle and the roar of cannon would be unheeded.

18880517: P, and the most recent English and American authorities, such an affidavit was inadmissible, and no appeal has been taken from the judgment granting this motion. It is scarcely necessary to notice a lengthy affidavit made by George Wallace, agent of appellants, setting forth the Riel rebellion and the newspaper war connected therewith, with the view of showing that French Canadians in general, and the French-speaking portion of this jury in particular, must be biased against the appellant's newspaper. As His Honor Mr. Justice Johnson remarks, the jury were unanimous in declaring that the respondent had suffered a wrong, and that the appellants had failed completely to make out their plea of justification. The only difference of opinion was as to the amount of damages, and on this question, the jury were nine to three. Consequently, three at least of the English-speaking jurors were of the opinion that the sum actually awarded was the proper amount, and they cannot be supposed to have been influenced by the alleged prejudice of Frenchmen against the appellants. Again, we are not told at how much the three dissenting jurors were prepared to assess the respondent's damages; they may have been in favor of awarding $5,000 or $7,000 or $8,000 instead of $10,000, and without such data, it is impossible to compare their ideas with those of the nine jurors who agreed on the latter sum. But at all events, any weight that could be attached to such vague and insufficient suspicions would at once disappear if in fact the amount of the verdict rendered be really not excessive. The review of verdicts given in cases analogous to the present one which the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Review has made in his opinion can have no doubt that in view of the standing of the respondent and of the wanton malice of the attack made on him, the verdict is anything but excessive, but on the contrary follows the amounts which have frequently been awarded by English juries and which the courts have refused over and over again to set aside. When we reflect that the respondent, who has been a member of Parliament, a Minister of the Crown, and a leader of the bar, is assailed eight years after he has retired from the political arena, when he is quietly pursuing the avocations of his profession, and is charged with having invented and boasted of an infamous electoral fraud for which four persons were convicted in a criminal trial, and which the appellants themselves characterize as the grossest and most villainous outrage ever perpetrated on the electors of Canada—that, not satisfied with defaming the respondent in their newspaper, the appellants add insult to injury, and tell him in their written and spoken pleadings that he has no reputation to lose; that he succeeded in attaining to a "bad eminence" by dishonesty and fraud, and that while holding his high office he rendered himself utterly incompetent for the discharge of his duties by drunkenness and dissipated habits—that they charge him with having in vain solicited a judgeship, which was refused him on account of his turpitude—that after having written and said such things and many more, the appellants go to trial and fail to prove one jot of their foul aspersions—we may be surprised that the verdict was not twice as severe as it is. MANITOBA LANDS, A Policy for the Settlement of Vacant Lands Near Winnipeg Inducements Offered Moderate Prices Asked The Prospects of Immigration. Ex-Aid Archibald McNee, of Winnipeg, was in the city yesterday, having just returned from a tour through western Ontario. To a representative of the Gazette, he said: "I have been promoting the scheme of the colonization committee which was appointed by the City Council and Board of Trade of Winnipeg for the settlement of the vacant lands within a radius of twenty miles of that city. I think the scheme is proving successful, letters lately received from Winnipeg stating that already some fifty families have settled on the land. These vacant lands consist largely of the lands granted to the Manitoba half-breeds at the time the province was taken over by the Dominion. They were given the privilege of selecting their lands in the vicinity of their parishes, and the result was that they were largely located in the vicinity of Winnipeg, as of course the parishes were surrounding that city. These lands have largely got into the hands of speculators, who obtained them at a very nominal figure from the half-breeds after they came into their possession, and those speculators held these lands at high figures, the result being that people who came into the province to settle, hearing what prices were wanted for them, gave them the go-by. Then, of course, the boom came along, and matters were made somewhat worse. That excitement was fanned into existence by a lot of speculators from the east, who hearing of the increase in the value of lands rushed up there from the older provinces with the expectation that they were going to get rich suddenly and take a lot of money out of the province, and the consequence was that a still higher figure was put upon the lands there. Many of the people, however, who owned these lands mortgaged...

Please let me know if you need further assistance! Here is the corrected text:

them to loan companies in order to raise money for further speculations, and the consequence has been that they have got largely out of the hands of speculators and into the hands of private individuals, loan companies, banks, etc. I may say that the question of settling these vacant lands has engaged the attention of the City Council and the Board of Trade for several years, it being felt that it was a great drawback not only to the city and its trade, but to the province as well, because the first glimpse which the stranger got of the public lands of the Northwest was these uncultivated lands and the effect was tiny—but beneficial. "Can these lands be procured at a reasonable price?" "Yes. The owners of these lands were told that if their prices and terms were reasonable, an effort would be made to direct settlement to them. The result was that the owners have discovered that the high prices which had formerly been put on these lands had frightened settlers away and they were really losing the opportunity of selling them. The committee, therefore, procured from these settlers prices and terms which seemed to be most reasonable in view of the many advantages that would accrue to settlers from their vicinity to Winnipeg. The prices range from THREE TO TEN DOLLARS AN ACRE. The low-priced land is mostly low, wet land, but capable of drainage, and the higher-priced land is in the immediate vicinity of the city, and higher and drier, with wood conveniences. The resident population of the city, as ascertained by the assessors last month, is 23,000, besides a floating population of 3,000, making a total population of 26,000. Our school system is said to be as good as is to be found in any city in Canada and a great deal better than in most places; at any rate, that is the opinion of educationalists who have visited the schools from the older provinces. We have twelve common schools, and while only two teachers were employed when I first went there in 1874, there are now over fifty teachers. The city is now expending $100,000 annually on public schools. In addition, we have four denominational colleges: the Presbyterian, Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Methodist, the latter being only recently organized. We are the centre of education, legislation, and law for the Northwest, and under these circumstances offer many advantages to settlers. Farmers can sell everything they raise, from a load of hay to a carrot, for cash. And then we have also nine railways centering in Winnipeg and the Hudson Bay railway will be running to Lake Manitoba this spring. It must not be forgotten either that farmers can get from three to ten cents per bushel more for their wheat at Winnipeg than at points further west, the difference per acre almost enabling the farmer to pay for his land the first year. The land in the vicinity of the valley of the Red River and the Assiniboine is also stronger in character and will bear more cropping than the lighter lands towards the west. It must also be remembered that in the Northwest we are free from the blizzards and cyclones that cause such destruction in Dakota and the Northwestern states, while the soil is equally as good as that across the lines. We have had a very large influx of a superior class of settlers this year. "What accommodation have you for new settlers arriving in the country?" "We have provided an immigrant shed convenient to the station in charge of a man which can be had free by those who wish to remain over in Winnipeg to examine these lands, and we have also a mail to meet immigrants at the station and afford them every information. I may also say that we are very sanguine that the Province will make steady progress, now that the disallowance question has been settled, the crop of last year having been the means of enabling farmers to pay off their indebtedness for implements and stock. Messrs. Wastie and McMillan are now in the Province of Ontario, having been sent down by the Manitoba Government to represent the Province in matters of immigration. Three little boys in a downriver town attend the same school. They are but four years old and are in the same class. The other day they were called out by the teacher and asked to spell a certain word. They all stood up, and one of the little fellows looked at the teacher and said: "Now, Mr., if you ain't in a terrible fix, ain't you?" 

LORD LANSDOWNE'S SPEECH

The Folly of the Imperial Council

Farewell Words (By our own reporters)

Ottawa, May 10. The following is the continuation of Lord Lansdowne's speech at the farewell banquet last evening. After pointing out the difficulty of assimilating the various tariffs of the different portions of the Empire, he continued: "But there is worse to come. You have got the whole of the British colonies into line. Are you sure they will stay there? We all know there is no such thing as finality in these fiscal arrangements. Circumstances alter. New discoveries are made. Now that communications and connections arise, your Imperial tariff will stand in need of revision and adjustment to circumstances as they alter from time to time. We must have an Imperial council, which might in itself be no doubt a very admirable thing. When I look around these tables, I feel inclined to submit a list of Canadian representatives which would take away Lord Rosebery's breath and stagger Lord Dunraven. But of this, I am convinced, that the public sentiment of the Canadian people would not permit such an assembly to tamper with what would be regarded here as the domestic business of the Canadian Parliament. It would be almost possible to draw in our imagination a humorous picture of THE RETURN OF THE CANADIAN DELEGATES to their own country after the adjournment of the Imperial council. They might find themselves in the painful position of having to report that the duties on some articles in which you were largely interested here, some carefully reared offspring of the Canadian tariff, had been removed or reduced, and they would add that they deplore the decision greatly themselves, but that there had been some "log rolling" at Westminster and that they had been outvoted, perhaps because the South African and Australian delegates were anxious that ostrich feathers or opossum skins should be admitted duty-free in a foreign country. I suspect that before long they would wish themselves safely back in their own Legislature again." (Laughter and applause)

THANKS AND REGRETS

I cannot end these observations without expressing my gratitude, not only for your friendly references to the past, but also for the interest with which you have spoken of our future prospects. I rejoice to feel, not only that you do not look upon our departure with indifference, but also that we shall carry with us your good wishes in the new career which is about to open for us in another part of the Empire. I feel that I stand in great need of your support in the face of the heavy load of responsibility which will shortly be resting upon my shoulders. The post which I am called upon to fill is certainly one of which the responsibilities are heavy, whether we look to the historical interest of the nations which it has been inhabited or whether we consider the vast problems which present themselves to those who are today engaged in securing the safety of the Indian empire, in maintaining peace and order within it, as in taking the necessary precautions to guard the people committed to their charge from the inroads of pestilence and famine, or whether again we look forward to those other problems which as time goes on and as education leavens and fertilizes these great masses of human beings and leads them to regard with increasing intelligence and an increasing desire to take part in the public affairs of their own country. Of this no doubt can arise that no more splendid or interesting field exists for those whose ambition it is to serve their country and the Empire of the Queen." (Great applause) 

And now, Mr. Mayor, it remains for me to thank you once more for your kindness to us and for all the kindness which we have received at the hands of your citizens. We shall leave you, but nothing can rob us of the memories and associations which have grown up since we have lived amongst you—memories and associations which we shall preserve amongst the most treasured reminiscences of our lives. (Loud applause) How many and how pleasant will be the Canadian visions which, in years to come, will float across the field of our imagination when we are far from hence—visions of the Canadian spring and of wood and field bursting, as they are bursting now, into leaf and flower; visions of summer and of delightful rambles among your mountains and rivers; visions of autumn and of hillsides clothed in hues which no eastern splendor could surpass; visions of winter with its clear skies, its exhilarating sports outdoors, and within the bright fire of lathroom logs, with our children and friends gathered around us. (Applause) Visions of all these and many more will come back to us as we roam unconsciously through the past. But, sir, above all and through all there will stand out clearly, as it were, in the foreground of the picture, the recollection of the people with whom during these years we have lived in the happiest and most unconstrained relations, a people kindly, hospitable, and generous to a fault. (Applause) And of no part of the Dominion shall we carry away pleasanter or more affectionate recollections than of this city, the city which has been our home, and around which there have grown up all those tender and touching associations which belong to the word. We did not know how deeply our roots had struck here until the time came when it was necessary to tear them up. (Great applause)

A FUNNY CONFESSION

Mr. Mayor, I will close what I have to say with a confession. I spent three-quarters of an hour last night in endeavoring to compose a peroration for this speech, but I could not hit upon anything quite to my liking. I have often noticed that a speaker will make you a speech transparent in its sincerity and devoid of affectation until he arrives at his concluding passage. I became convinced that tonight anything of a conventional character would jar with my own feelings to such an extent that I consigned my peroration to the fireplace where it ended, as most perorations do, in smoke. (Laughter and applause) Under these distressing circumstances, I am going to ask your permission to read to you as a peroration one or two sentences from a document recently discovered at Government House in an apartment which, I understand, will shortly be occupied by Lord Mauley. It is evidently a fragment or a series of fragments of a diary, and you may be able to aid me with a conjecture as to its authorship. The first entry is dated towards the close of 1883. It runs as follows: "In for five years of expatriation. Almost wish I had stuck to North Wiltshire. Must make the best of it." (Laughter) The next entry is in 1884: "We are making the best of it, and find it very far from unpleasant. Fancy the five years will pass quickly." Then comes another in the following year: "Time passing very quickly and pleasantly. I take back what I wrote about expatriation." After this comes the following in 1886: "Time positively flying. We are beginning to feel quite at home here. Not quite sure that we shall not have to make it six years instead of five." Then, sir, there comes in 1888 an entry occasioned evidently by some event which exercised a very great effect on the mind of the writer: "These Canadians are splendid fellows and have stood by us nobly. We have quite made up our minds to make it six years." (Great applause) Last of all comes an entry written in rather shaky character and runs thus: "Why could not he remain where he was? It goes to our heart to leave this country and kind-hearted people. I trust they will remember us. We shall not forget them while we live." And, Mr. Mayor, take my word for it, we shall not forget them. (Tremendous cheers) 

When His Excellency resumed his seat, he received another ovation lasting for a considerable time.

18880524: The second innings. It is now thought in New York that the Cythera was in collision March 22nd, the first night of the blizzard, and her crew taken off by a vessel bound for some distant port. The Chicago papers have started a story about the immense strength of Borchers, the new pitcher, to the effect that he can tear a pack of cards with his fingers and split a silver coin with his teeth. The mysterious young unknown has been privately tried by the Hamiltons, and his performance was satisfactory. He has signed a contract but will not pitch a game until he develops sufficient confidence. At a meeting of the Argonaut Rowing Club, held for the purpose of revising the constitution, it was decided to limit the number of life members to fifty, and to raise the fees for such members to $100.

18880811: A WALL STREET BOOK Henry Clews Reviews his Experiences at the Money Centres Mention of "The Street—Nineteenth Century" and its business Commodore Vanderbilt, Daniel Drew, Jay Gould and Others. Seldom does a good actor make a successful dramatist. There never yet was an example of a brilliant soldier making an able historian of his own achievements. By parity of reasoning, it will not be surprising that in "Twenty-eight Years in Wall Street" Mr. Henry Clews, the banker, has made a rambling, dull, turgid book out of a theme with which he is as thoroughly familiar as any living American. It is now thirty years since Henry Clews found his way to Wall Street. It was on the heels of the financial panic of 1857 that he made his advent in the street, but Mr. Clews does not tell us how he came to go there or what he did after he went there. He does not say, however, that the panic of 1857 was called the "Western blizzard." Was it? The mention of the crash that preceded Mr. Clews' debut in the street recalls to his reflective mind the operators and methods of thirty years ago. The old-fashioned business men who did business in Wall Street at that time seem to have inspired the enterprising operator with a sort of contemptuous respect. Although Jacob Little made and lost nine fortunes in his day and Anthony Morse, "the lightning calculator," conjured up a million with assets as unsubstantial as those of Ferdinand Ward and saw it disappear with a magic that would startle Keene himself, these old-timers, the "antique element," as Mr. Clews calls them, knew nothing of the blessings of "corners" and "blind pools" and kept on "choking off salutary enterprise" by doing business in a legitimate way. And yet it seems to be the old fellows after all that make money in Wall Street. Few persons gain sufficient experience, Mr. Clews informs us, to command success until they have one foot in the grave, but when that happy time comes these "old veterans of the street" are seen "hobbling down on their canes to their brokers' offices" in times of panic to secure a big "rake in." According to Mr. Clews' account of them, they are a cross between Dives and the devil, but all the same, Mr. Henry Clews is terribly shocked at that "clerical obliquity of judgment" that has led the Rev.

18880831: THE PARADISE OF WOMEN An English Writer Says that Canada Is the Place. According to Miss Jessie Saxby, Canada is the paradise of women. There are too many women in England; too many men, too, but not enough in quantity nor good enough in quality, for the women. It is the west of Canada, naturally, that is the paradise truly required. In Quebec and Montreal, wages do not seem exorbitantly high. That rare article, a trained cook, only gets some £250 a year in Quebec and Montreal. In the wilder and more liberal west, a good cook may get about £1,000 a year, not at all too much if she is really a good cook, but more than she obtains in England. Moreover, the heavy work is done, and very properly, by men. Men scrub the floors and are hewers of wood and carriers of water, and churn, and milk the cows. Servants in the west of Canada become members of the family in farmhouses as in old England. Best of all, a woman in the west can choose her mate from "Britons of larger body and larger hearts than those at home." Home-dwelling Britons, at least in large towns, are notoriously degenerated and shambling creatures. Pity being akin to love and nobody else coming forward, a woman puts up with the existing race, but she will find in Canada affectionate sons of Anak. They are all most anxious to get married, whereas the Briton of this country rather inclines to defer the crisis in his existence, after which the road (according to America's adopted moralist) lies dusty and long and straight to the grave. The "Titans of the West" have no such hesitation and forebodings. England is advised to lend "the roses of her rosebud girls to soften and sweeten life in the wild West." It is not so much educated girls that are wanted, not our pale, etiolated, anemic girls, but our rosebuds, best quality, education being rather a drawback than otherwise. The pale prodigies of Girton and Lilly Margaret's (if they are pale) would not suit the Titans of the West, and perhaps each would consider herself mated with a clown. That is just possible. There must be some drawback to the most glorious lot in life. We (Saturday Review) would not for a moment discourage the transplantation of hardy rosebud girls, but they must remember that the climate of the wild west has the wild blizzard among its fauna, that the cold, though healthy, is extreme; that they will have to rough it a good deal if they go in an emigrant vessel, and that in the Paradise of Women they will find hard work as well as good food and Titanic husbands who, we trust, do not, like the elder Titans, devour their children. People who encourage female emigration to Canada deserve all praise, but they should beware of painting the prospects of the rosebuds too roseate. Disappointment is certain to come of that, even in a country where "there seems about one woman to every fifty men." In the original paradise, there was only one woman to one man, and philosophers have held that she was one too many. On the other hand, the Canadian proportions are exaggerated in the opposite direction. Each woman must be a queen till she is married to a Titan, but after that her estate will be a good deal more homely and less regal. The condition of affairs appears likely to encourage flirtation rather than marriage. At the very best, a wise virgin will be in no hurry to make up her mind, and this may just possibly lead to difficulties among the Titans. London Globe.

18880926: A Byrne and Arthur Wallack was produced for the first time at the Royalty Theatre, Glasgow, on Monday week, and has scored a distinct success. Both press and public support it warmly. The flowers that actresses like are as varied as the people themselves. Some of these favorites of the footlights delight in wearing or carrying bouquets made up of the most rare and costly blooms, while others affect the simple blossoms of the country. The actress is a good angel of the florist, for, whether the blizzard blows or the snow flies, she must have her bouquet. Mrs. Langtry, through her love for that flower, is known the world over as "The Lily." Mrs. Potter loves the red rose. Miss Pauline Hall has a penchant for the great ox-eyed daisy. Miss Marie Junsen prefers the pansy. Fanny Davenport loves the lily, the lotus, and the rose. Rose Coghlan in summer wears great bunches of goldenrod, plucked from the hedges about her farm at Yonkers, and in winter she wears La France and big Jack roses. The orchid is Mme. Modjeska's delight, although she wears the more readily obtainable roses. Maud Harrison loves flowers of all varieties. 

Ex A New Kind of Protectionist (From La Minerve): Because the workingmen's candidate refused to enroll himself in Mr. Laurier's free trade battalion, the Liberals have raised a fictitious opposition to him. They have set up against him not another workingman, for workingmen are not free traders, but a young politician without experience in public affairs, whose only title to the confidence of the electors is that he is Mr. Laurier's candidate. They have laid it down as a principle that, in order to have the support of the Liberal party in Montreal, the candidate must declare himself a free trader like Mr. Laurier and Sir R. Cartwright, and undertake, with these two Utopian theorists, to combat the government which has given the country the boon of the National Policy and rescued the working people from the misery under which they groaned under the reign of Messrs. Mackenzie, Cartwright, and Laurier. By such a course, they insult the workingmen, who are about all Protectionists and understand their own interests, and the latter are bound by respect for themselves to vote en masse against the candidate of a policy that is anti-national and annexationist. The young Liberal candidate, who is nothing more than a puppet in the hands of the Rouge leaders, knows only one sort of protection, that which procures places and sinecures. He has sought positions under all governments, Conservative and Liberal. He obtained a situation at Ottawa under the Conservatives, but he brought on his dismissal by grossly insulting the men whose favors he had solicited. He then sought and obtained another position from the Quebec Government, and it is on that he now depends for a livelihood. But that kind of protection cannot be extended to everybody. In order effectively to protect the masses, the working class especially, governments must adopt a certain policy. Now Mr. Poirier, who has hitherto confined his views on protection to what concerned simply himself, comes before the electors as the opponent of protection for the many. He wants it for himself and his friends, but he would refuse it to the people, to the workingmen. He knows very well that the electors will not send him to Ottawa to combat the National Protective policy in the ranks of Mr. Laurier; but his masters will recompense him by increasing the protection that he enjoys from the Liberal Quebec Government whose official he is. He is, in fine, only the creature, the instrument of Mr. Mercier and Mr. Laurier who consulted his own interests alone in imposing him on so important a constituency as Montreal East.

18881031: R; he was a law unto himself, nay, more, he was above the law. The last session of the Dominion Parliament was, accordingly, allowed to pass without any attempt on the part of the provincial Government to secure such legislation as would enable them to effect these crossings, and, without which, they knew they would be powerless to move except by violating the law. The responsibility, therefore, for the existing situation rests upon our own Government, and especially upon Mr. Martin as the Attorney-General, who is the law officer of the Crown in Manitoba. The defeat of the Manitoba lawbreakers ought to be a lesson to them. It may serve to teach Mr. Martin that even so high and mighty a personage as he esteems himself is amenable to the law, and that he cannot be allowed to outrage it and provoke riot and bloodshed in order to turn public attention from this worse than blundering bargain he has made with the Northern Pacific officials, a bargain the people of Manitoba will have good cause to rue before many months have elapsed. 

A THREAT REVIVED: The story that President Cleveland intends to proclaim the Retaliation act of March, 1887, in the hope of bettering his chances of re-election is revived. It is not an improbable rumor, now that Lord Sackville's blunder has embittered Democratic feeling against Great Britain, frightened the President's friends with the fear that he may thereby lose a large Irish-American vote, and rendered necessary in their opinion some strong and tangible evidence of Mr. Cleveland's hostility to all things British. If he proclaims the act now on the Statute book in its full force and entirety, the result will be absolute non-intercourse of trade between Canada and the United States, and for the serious loss and confusion to the commerce of both countries that would follow such an act of folly, he can throw some responsibility on the Republican party, which was mainly instrumental in securing the passage of the measure. It is not a little disquieting to think that the friendly and commercial relations of Canada and the United States can be suddenly snapped to win a sectional vote in a political contest, that the maintenance of the cordial intercourse between our neighbors and ourselves may hang upon the whims of the demagogic leaders of the Irish-American element. Mr. Cleveland has within a couple of days held close intercourse with men who profess to control this vote, and if he has heeded their counsel, we must prepare for even so stupendous a blunder as the proclamation of the non-intercourse act. Such a course might profit the Democrat and re-elect Mr. Cleveland, but a man of sensitive honor, of broad and courageous statesmanship, would rather suffer defeat a hundred times than purchase it at the price of embittered international relations and commercial hostility to a friendly and innocent neighbor.

If you have any further requests or need additional corrections, feel free to ask! Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

In consenting to advise a citizen of the country to which he was accredited as an ambassador as to how his franchise was to be exercised in deciding a domestic issue, the exigencies of the presidential election have precipitated Mr. Cleveland's action and compelled him, to face his chances with the anti-British voters, to take a step that for harshness has few precedents in diplomatic usage. It would have been better that Lord Sackville had voluntarily resigned the moment he saw the evil his blunder was likely to cause one of the parties in the political struggle now on the eve of decision. It would have been better even if Lord Salisbury had recalled at once a minister whose usefulness had ceased. As it is, Lord Sackville will depart under a sense of personal humiliation that has been made more intense by the unrestrained criticism to which he has been subjected by the press of Great Britain and the United States. This is a new experience for a British ambassador that will not likely have to be repeated. Lord Sackville will find no imitators in such free letter-writing, and henceforth diplomats in the United States will be even more than usually careful in their correspondence, knowing that when it serves a political party purpose, neither the obligations that rest upon the claimant to the title of gentleman nor the sacredness of private letters will avail to preserve their confidence from the public eye, nor their persons from the attacks of warring demagogues. "What went ye out into the wilderness to see?" would be an appropriate text for the Winnipeg divines to hold forth upon about this time. After weathering the Quebec provincialist gale and the Manitoba provincialist blizzard, the Dominion constitution seems to be just as good as new. Lord Sackville holds that the point west to which it is advisable for a diplomatic young man to go lies considerably on this side of the latitude of California. There is only one thing to be said for the correspondent who betrayed Lord Sackville's confidence; he has so much respect for his name that he will not reveal his identity. When Judas felt much as he must feel, he went and hanged himself. There are a number of old men yet alive who sat around the Council board when the basis of the federal constitution was laid; and how they must chuckle as they see Messrs. Mercier and Martin rubbing their bruised shins after foolish attempts to kick a hole in the solid foundations. Quebec's Mr. Mercier was not just handsome when he gathered himself up after his mill with the federal constitution, but he looked like an Adonis compared with Manitoba's Mr. Martin, as he wipes the dirt of the Northern Pacific roadbed out of his wounds, and looks around to see who the people are laughing at. The meeting to promote the formation of a citizens' league called for this afternoon should be well attended. The work it is intended to co-operate in is of the highest importance to the welfare of the city. Its necessity has been long admitted by all sections of the people. Legislation to advance it can only be secured by strong protestations coming from a strong organization. All who have studied the matter see this, and all who desire a remedy should join in the movement to secure it. The Toronto Young Men's Liberal Club is to include among its objects the promotion of a sentiment of Canadian nationality and the study of the resources of Canada and its people. As they progress in their task, they will come to have a somewhat small idea of some of the old men Liberals whom they have been following in the past. Lord Sackville may feel rather small today, but he would hardly shake hands with Mr. Blaine and the other Republican statesmen who have taken advantage of the betrayal of his confidence to advance their political interests at the expense of their feelings as honorable men. The shame of the matter does not rest alone on a British pair of shoulders. What the Witness calls the "fangs" of the Canadian Pacific Railway are soon to be inserted in the trade of Windsor. To bring this end about, the mayor and council of the Essex town have been exerting themselves at a lively rate and have promised the road substantial advantages. All of which goes to show that there are a great variety of opinions in this world of ours. Mr. Goldwin Smith, if the statement he correctly attributed to him is wrong, is saying that the proper title of the British Minister at Washington is Lord De La Warr. Mortimer, first Baron Sackville, was the son of the fifth Earl De La Warr and the younger brother of the present Earl. His next brother, Lionel Sackville-West, was, under a special remainder, constituted heir presumptive to the barony on its creation in 1876. Lord De La Warr's heir is his son, Lionel Charles Crantield, Viscount Cantelupe. As he also has a brother, there are really three lives, if not more, between Lord Sackville and the Earldom of De La Warr. The City Council has appointed Mr. Benoit, of St. Henri, to the chiefship of the Fire Brigade. Judged by the standard of experience in the duties required of him and acquaintance with the city, Mr. Dockinghain was best qualified for the position, and his selection for promotion would have given greatest satisfaction to the citizens most largely interested in the property that is at risk. The majority of the aldermen in their wisdom, however, have thought differently. Mr. Benoit, to a large extent, has his reputation to make. Justice to him, as well as regard for the welfare of the city, requires that he shall be given fair play by the citizens and that support from the council which alone enables a civic servant to efficiently discharge the functions of his office.

1888-11-08: T. Wesley Mills, in the chair. A student of human medicine of the second year related an instance of apparent heredity of a mental trait. A mare and seven of her colts, though not broken by the same person, showed the peculiarity of stopping with extreme suddenness at the word "whoa." A member of the society had known in Ireland a stallion that always, when going through a stable doorway, etc., made a sudden rush, lowering his head at the same time. This behavior was also evinced by his offspring to the fourth generation. It seemed to have originated from this stallion having been struck when passing out on one occasion, he then having hurt himself against the side of the passage. Another member stated that he had owned a horse perfectly gentle with ladies and when driven by a man that was intoxicated, even stopping if the sleigh was overturned and looking around, but comparatively unmanageable when driven by men if sober. Such an animal must be credited with much intelligence. The president pointed to the sense of humor of horses and their tantalizing behavior at times, as when in a pasture field. One member had known of a large horse that would allow the owner's wife to feed him, but not himself. He, on one occasion as an experiment, put on one of his wife's dresses, but the horse detected the imposture and behaved as usual. Gun-shyness in dogs was discussed. It was found that the same principle was illustrated in horses. One of the members had worked a horse that was greatly terrified by the sound of the whistle of locomotives, and on one occasion he had been held while the whistle was blowing and after a violent trembling had fallen dead. Reference was made to the conduct of the collie dog of an absent member. When the latter was packing his trunk, he could not be induced to leave the spot and contrary to his usual custom had insisted upon following him everywhere through the house. He had seen the same trunk packed for his master once before and moped during his entire absence. His human-like behavior could only be explained on the same principles as apply to our own minds. It seemed but right to take such a dog on the journey and this was done. The president said the realization of the fact that something very grave was to happen could scarcely have been shown more fully by a human being than in the case of a dog of unusual intelligence. He once had occasion to send off by express, when placed on the box that was used to transport him, it was very painful to witness the evidence of his deep emotion. A member from the West instanced the case of a collie that after the death of the herder had safely driven into the corral the 7,000 sheep that composed the herd. This same dog during a blizzard had remained out all night looking after the strayed animals. Another member related how a gentleman living at Point St. Charles, seeing a rat in a bad plight, had given the creature milk and continued to do so as it appeared day after day in his yard. It became tame like a kitten and played around among his children, but never entered his kitchen. It was expressed that a small portion of the press of the city saw fit to publish occasionally a series of narratives of animals, especially of encounters between them and men, which to say the least were very highly colored and not calculated to advance the cause of comparative psychology or truth in any form. 

A Fatal Suicide from Unrequited Love. A sad case of suicide occurred yesterday morning. A young girl named Marie Louise Higgins, aged 10 years, was left an orphan at the age of six years. Mr. Duguay, who resides at No. 679 Mignonne street, having no children of his own, adopted her. She grew up into a prepossessing young lady and fell in love with a young clerk, who, however, did not return her affections. She threw out all her endeavors to get his love, but to no avail. Seeing that she could not gain his love, she resolved to die. Yesterday she went to a chemist's shop and procured a quantity of rat poison. She then returned home and, going to bed, swallowed the stuff. The family were alarmed by her shrieks, which were caused by the agony occasioned by the arsenic in the rat poison. Medical attendance was at once sent for, but she died in a short time. The Coroner held an inquest at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, when a verdict of "Suicide while in a state of mental despondency from unrequited love" was returned.

Address to Mrs. Margaret E. Parker. Yesterday afternoon, Mrs. Margaret E. Parker, the founder of the British Woman's Temperance Association, addressed a crowded meeting yesterday afternoon at the Evangelistic Hall. Miss Dougall introduced Mrs. Parker, telling of her connection with the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, of which Mrs. Lucas, the sister of John Bright, was the first president, succeeded by Miss Wilhud, who is at present in office. Mrs. Parker is one of the organizers for the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union and hopes to visit the Sandwich Islands on this errand before returning to Great Britain. She is now on her way to California by the Canadian Pacific with a party of 32 British temperance women for whom she can secure very desirable situations. She told of the effect which the story of the Woman's Crusade in Ohio 15 years ago had in Britain and especially of the enthusiasm of the women of Dundee in the temperance cause. She spoke of the college house movement and many questions were asked by the ladies concerning the best methods. It was easy to get people to take shares, as there was an average return of 10 percent upon the money invested. Often a lady of means would purchase a public house and fit it up for a coffee house, generally giving the manager a pecuniary interest in the business. The Montreal ladies took much interest in helping to fill the lunch baskets of the party, and a collection of $13.50 was taken up for the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

A woman, charged before the Recorder in the afternoon, requested to be committed to jail for six months. She said she had been on a spree and wanted the time to sober up. His Honor granted her request and added a $10 fine or three months more.

1888-11-10: Kitting Yarns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 PLY Fingerlings: Snow, Frost, Arctic, Acme, Blizzard, Desideratum, Berlin, Merino, Lady Betty, Andean, Paxony, Non-shrinkable, Wheeling, Shetland. The largest stock of Knitting Wools to select from in the Dominion. A full range of colors in the celebrated Snowflake and Arctic always in stock.

1888-11-16: W. Stewart and Mr. Smith C. Lee, two members of the club, who left New York last March in the Cythera for a cruise in the West Indies. Nothing has been heard of yacht or crew since, the general belief being that she was lost in the blizzard of March 12. The Cythera was an English yawl-rigged cutter, brought to America.

1888-11-19: C., and all the money recovered. A Non Hills. His Father, Kt. R. A., Ohio, November 18. Last night Joseph and Louis Coon, brothers, engaged in a fight and John Coon, their father, attempted to separate them. Joseph struck his father with a stone, breaking his neck and producing instant death. Joseph escaped. Leprosy in Dakota. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

Rear Admiral Baldwin died in New York on Saturday afternoon. The New York World says that Congressman Perry Belmont has been appointed United States Minister to Spain. A special from Muscogee, Indiana Territory, reports the amicable adjustment of the difficulties between Governor Guy of the Chickasaw Nation and the Byrd faction. Frank E. Pooley, who sued the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railway Company for damages in a collision on the day of the big blizzard, March 12th last, was yesterday awarded $6,000 damages. The heavy Chicago wholesale clothing firm of Lindatier BrJ & Co. filed confessions of judgment on Friday, aggregating $181,052. The firm is one of the largest firms of wholesale clothiers in the country.

**Many Disastrous Conflagrations in Various Parts of the World**  
**Thessalon, Ont, November 17** The saw mill, stove heading, shingle and lathe factory, owned by W. H. Thompson and operated by Thompson, Tessant & Co., was totally destroyed by fire last night. By strenuous efforts, aided by a heavy snowstorm, the large stock of heading, lumber, etc., was saved. Loss about $5,000, insured for $1,000. 

In the Gore District, Mutual London, November 17, Brokerton's cotton mill at Preston has been burned. Loss $40,000. 

**Charleston, S.C., November 17** The British vessel Sundiiham, loading with cotton for Reval, took fire in the forward hold today. Seventeen hundred bales of cotton were destroyed.

**An Indian Murderer Sentenced to Death**  
**Immigration in October**  
(From our own correspondent)  
**Ottawa, November 18** Judge Priest has made a report to the Department of Justice of the trial at Ucluelet, B.C., of an Indian named Isennoquor for the murder in July last of an Indian boy named Moiso. Isennoquor was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged on the twelfth of December. Senators Sanford and Turner were here yesterday and obtained from His Excellency the Governor-General a promise to open the Hamilton Art exhibition. Immigration returns for the month of October show an increase over the same month last year of 3,180 in the total number of arrivals and of 3,043 in the number of settlers in the Dominion. The total number of arrivals since the first of January has been 186,807, of whom 78,212 settled in Canada, being an increase of 10,511 over the same period last year. West Lynne appears for the first time in the report, there being 246 entries at that point, all of whom settled in Canada. These are presumably either Canadians returning from the United States disappointed or American settlers blown by the blizzards of Dakota to the more congenial climate of the Canadian Northwest. Cunningham Stewart, comptroller of postal finances, is ill with typhoid fever. Dr. Ralph Bell, of the Geological Survey staff, who has been engaged all summer making a geological examination of the unknown regions between the mouth of the Mississagi River, the northeast coast of Lake Huron and the Montreal River, a tributary of the Ottawa River, has returned home and will make an exhaustive report to the Government. 

**ANOTHER BRIDGE ACCIDENT**  
**Cornwall Canal, for a Day or Two**  
**Cornwall, Ont, November 18** Another accident has occurred in the Cornwall Canal. About five o'clock yesterday afternoon while the barge Cleveland was entering Gillie's lock, the lock gates gave way, causing a stoppage of navigation. A force of men was put to work immediately to repair the damage and will be kept at it until it is completed. The gates will probably be repaired by noon tomorrow, when navigation will again be resumed. The last of the boats that had been delayed at the head of the canal before repairs on the break were completed had only just passed through when the accident happened. Another lot of delayed vessels is now gathering at the head and foot of the canal. They will all get through by tomorrow night. 

**THE MAIL STEAMER**  
**The Polynesian, First of the Winter Boat this Year**  
(From our own correspondent)  
**Halifax, N.S., November 18** The Allan steamer Polynesian, the first of the weekly winter mail boats, arrived at 3 o'clock this morning with 170 passengers. Her mails and passengers were promptly despatched west. She brings the following passengers: Mr.

**18881126: Y, November 25** A violent snowstorm, partaking of the character of a blizzard, set in here at noon today and still prevails up to a late hour tonight. The wind blew at the rate of 50 miles an hour. On the river, the storm was terrific.

**18881130: B** Thomas will also be disposed of under the hammer. No football eleven has scored against Yale this season, and this clean score is the first on record for the Blues. In the last seven years, the only game lost was to Princeton, 6 to 3, when Lamar made his wonderful run at the very close of the game. Yale scored 2,838 points in 57 games played in this period, against 147. The closest score against Yale in one year was 14 in 1884. This year, Yale scored 308 points to 0. During the mini blizzard of Sunday afternoon, a remarkable game of football was played at Fordham between teams representing St. John's College and the American Athletic Club of New York. The game was played in about a foot of snow, and to see the teams line up after each scrimmage, all covered with snow, was a picturesque if not very cheering spectacle. In the first half, neither side scored, and it was not until five minutes before the end of the second half that the winning touchdown was secured by St. John's, but no goal was kicked.

**18881217: 1L** M Johnson says Fred Davis, the runner, can go around the bases in 12 4-5 seconds, which is better than most players can do on a straightaway race for that distance. During the recent annual meeting of the Western Baseball Association, it came out that the several clubs lost in the aggregate $6,000 last season instead of $14,000 as heretofore published. The Canadian Sportsman has published a lifelike lithograph engraving of Champion William O'Connor sitting in his shell on Toronto Bay, and sporting his blue and white costume with the good-luck horseshoe on his breast. The Harvard Bicycle Club has decided to challenge Yale to a bicycle road race immediately after the final examinations in June next. The choice of distance, course, etc., is to be left to Yale, the number of competitors to be from 5 to 10. It is said the actual running expenses of Mr. William Astor's large steam yacht, the Nourmalial, are $6,000 a month, and that this sum covers only the cost of fuel, wages, and keep of the crew. She cost $300,000, and Mr. Astor uses her only about three months each year. The Victoria Football Club will hold their annual concert tomorrow evening at Victoria Rifles Armory. Among those who will take part are Mrs. Wallace, Misses McLeod, Chatwin, Allan, Hodgson, and Messrs. Niven, Stewart, Milne, Robt. Lloyd, Robertson, Tattersall, Wermelinger, and Detmers. An exchange asks: "What is the matter with the Bostons for next season?" Nothing at present, my boy. The flies hibernate during the winter months, and the odor that arises from a sugar-cured team is not perceptible when the blizzards blow and the thermometers are wearing overcoats. Wait until the torrid days of July and then ask that question. Mr. Frank Heroic, of Pittsburgh, Pa., proposes to institute a novelty in the shape of six days racing on the ice, at the Exposition Park, in that city, between Christmas and New Year's. The grandstand will be fitted up and warmed so it will be perfectly comfortable, and three or four races, for trotters and pacers, with liberal purses, will be given each day.

**18881219: IUNV** Albany, N.Y., December 18 The storm which ended in this city today was equivalent to two feet of snow. It rained steadily yesterday and last night, and after midnight snowed for several hours. The Hudson has risen rapidly and is overflowing the piers and wharves of the city. A rise of over seven feet since last night was noted at noon today. The storm locally had many of the characteristics of last March's blizzard. The lowest barometer ever recorded by the Signal Officer here was noted today at 29.08. The river is still rising through the southerly winds, but a warming thermometer will probably check the flood.

**TORONTO IS GOOD IN MILD**  
**Toronto, December 18** Toronto has got her winter at last. The mild weather which has prevailed up to the present has kept business at a low ebb, and the city has presented none of the bustle generally seen before the holidays.

**18881222:** I, as cook of the schooner Blizzard. There he fell in with Miss Mary Ann Sharp, and after an acquaintance of a fortnight, they were married, the event taking place on November 24th. They went to a hotel at Charlottetown, where they were spending the honeymoon, when Brown suddenly took his departure and Miss Sharp has not seen him since, but he recently wrote to her requesting her to come to Halifax to meet him there to go to Boston. After his departure from the island, her friends made inquiries concerning him and they learned that he had a family living at Lunenburg.

**In New York**  
**New York, December 21** DeBaun, who is accused of embezzling $90,000 from the National Park Bank, and who was arrested after a sojourn in Canada, was held in $40,000 bail for trial today. 

**Winnipeg Whispers**  
**Winnipeg, December 21** An effort is being made to form a branch here of the Imperial Federation League of Toronto. The last Canadian Pacific Railroad excursion is worth $18,000 to the company. 

**Epps Cocoa**  
By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operation of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast tables with a delicately flavored beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are flitting around us ready to attack wherever there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame.

**18881228: DAKOTA'S GREAT BLIZZARD**  
**Incidents Told by a Government School Teacher**  
(Atlantic Monthly)  
As the time for blizzards comes round again, I propose to invite the club to meet at our camp in Rosebud Agency, Southern Dakota. To prepare the minds of the members, let me recall our experience of last January. We knew before we got out of bed, in this little government schoolhouse, that the most awful storm we had ever witnessed was imminent. The sky was inky. In a few minutes, the storm began, and in half an hour from this time it was at its height. Lilia ventured a few yards out of the front door at its beginning and was near not getting back. The wind struck her with such violence as to bring her head down to a level with her knees and take away her breath. She said she was "near falling on her face, and she knew that if she fell she would not get up again." She got to the house, bent at the angle into which the wind had forced her. The storm raged, without one moment's abatement or lull, during the whole day and far into the night, when we fell asleep. At first, the little frame building creaked and shivered like a ship at sea, and we wondered how anything constructed by the hand of man could stand against that wind. After the first half hour, it was impossible...

It was impossible to distinguish the sound of groaning timbers, for the cars were filled with the rush of the elements. It was like the roar and surging of a mighty ocean. Being in the house, we could see out a few yards on one side—the side from which the storm did not come. On the other three sides, the snow beat and came in (though the house is close and tight), and went halfway across the schoolroom. It hung in a beautiful fringe, several inches long, from the drying room, stretched across the room, and festooned the maps on the walls, and finally blocked up the windows till they were as impenetrable as snowbanks. It was a comfort for us to believe, as we then did, that this greatest of all the blizzards had set in as early in other camps as in ours, and that no human being was exposed to its fury. No sun had risen over our heads on that day, and we had rung no school bell; we could not know that bells were ringing from many a prairie schoolhouse, and that the fair promise of the day was luring men, women, and children to their doom. 

On the afternoon preceding this destructive day, no snow fell, but the force of the wind was so great that it lifted up from the boundless prairie the accumulated drifts of weeks and carried them along in great waves, so that the whole earth seemed in motion and rising heavenward. The outline of these vast billows and the intervening troughs, as seen against the horizon, was the most impressive sight that had ever met our eyes. On the morning of the 13th, the mercury registered 25 degrees below zero, and the wind was blowing cruelly. The drifts between us and the village were so deep that we thought it unsafe to ring for the children. But they came over the half mile, through drifts waist-deep to large children, and the two faithful policemen, Stiff Arm and Cut Boot, came to see how we had got through the blizzard. 

The schoolroom was not to be thought of on that bitter day, and we brought the children and the policemen into our bedroom to thaw out. We ran the mercury up to 110 degrees within two feet of the stove; at a distance of eight feet, it was ninety-five degrees lower. Not one of the children uttered a sound of complaint, but the big tears rolled silently down the swollen cheeks of one of the little girls when the genial warmth of the room began to make her comfortable. Our fifteen-mile-off neighbor, the young teacher at the next camp, stepped in one evening to ask if we could give him a bed for the night. He had been trying all day to get to his camp and had consumed four hours in traveling one mile and a half. His plucky little Indian pony dragged the wagon through the heavy drifts by main force, the wheels not turning and the horse waddling where he could not walk. The faithful creature was quite exhausted. A sheet of ice enclosed his nose, and an icicle more than a foot long hung from it. This gentle animal, during the blizzard of the 12th, not only broke his halter but pawed down a thick stable door with hinges a foot long. His master went out into the storm to see how he was faring. He spent two hours looking for him, though he was only a few yards from him. When found, he was a mass of ice, his eyes nearly closed by it and a giant icicle hanging from his nose. Mr. Warner's own eyelashes froze every time he winked, and he had to hold his hand to his face and send the hot breath up to them before he could open them again. We hear this is common enough in Dakota, but we didn’t stay out long enough to wink. 

Winnipeg; News Notes. Winnipeg, December 27—It is understood the Northern Pacific Manitoba Railway, despite the recent decision of the Supreme Court, will press for a Dominion charter at the forthcoming session of the Commons. Shadilen's outfit has arrived from Montreal and is already engaged in freighting merchandise goods. The Board of Trade has petitioned the Postmaster-General to extend the mail service on the Glenboro branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway. It is believed the Northern Pacific will erect a large first-class hotel in Winnipeg, as announced some time ago. Treasurer Jones is expected to return to Winnipeg shortly. A clerk named H. I. Ton was a very creditable one, and showed the lodge to be in a very nourishing condition, both financially and in regard to membership.

PREDICTING THE WEATHER. V. by the Meteorological Office. Sometimes full reports are a blizzard. John P. Fluley, of the U.S. Signal Corps, in a paper in Harper's Weekly, says: "In making weather predictions, the officers have great difficulties to overcome, owing to the limited number of signal stations, the sharp gradients of temperature, and the great variety of local peculiarities that must be kept in mind. There is a constant demand for completeness when, owing to the nature of the phenomena, it is impossible to draw a line and predict rain on one side of it and none on the other. The exact extent of a downpour in case the probabilities indicate light rain cannot be measured in advance closely, especially near the Atlantic coast or the Great Lakes, because the coldness and moisture of great bodies of water increase the rainfall. In fact, the correctness of predictions for the Atlantic coast would be improved by the presence of signal light-ships in the Atlantic Ocean. This has been thought of by the Signal Service officers, and the scheme was definitely proposed on three occasions. It was abandoned, owing to the great expense and the difficulties in anchoring and construction. But aside from this lack of observing stations, the difficulties of prediction in the known regions of the central West are very great. Storm centers, as indicated on the tri-daily charts, may move with more than double the speed calculated, or they may remain at rest, or unexpectedly vanish. "Local rain" means rain at half the stations in a district, and when none results in many miles of territory, people think the prediction has failed, yet it may be found verified when the charts are examined. In autumn or winter, the prediction of local rain may mean heavy or continuous storm. For this reason, the word "local" is often omitted in winter. It is the custom of the officer in charge to predict rain as far as possible, that the people may take umbrellas unnecessarily rather than be wet through. The officer usually predicts for forty different districts, for which temperature, weather, and wind must be determined. Each decision must be made in sixty seconds, which requires great quickness and accuracy. It is the most difficult and responsible work required of any government officer. An error in temperature prediction at critical times in the autumn may freeze up the river traffic, causing boats to be detained in midstream, resulting in great damage. A mistake in a cyclone prediction might cause great loss of life and property among the shipping along the coast or on the lakes. The summer predictions are most difficult because the barometric centers lack intensity or are undecided. Decided storm movements have a regularity that can be foreseen better in regions where most of the great storm centers originate, along the northern ranges of the Rocky Mountains. It is far from easy to estimate the special direction of the eastward movement of storms, but as they leave the Mississippi Valley, they become more calculable. They advance toward regions of great moisture, and the knowledge of these regions is an important element of the predictions. The principal use of the weather prediction is to establish averages that shall progressively leave narrower margins of uncertainty. From a local situation, they must often seem to fail; yet it is always best to heed the morning predictions because nearly seventy percent of them will be found correct from the point of view of personal experience, and aside from the verifications by agencies in the Signal Service charts. The skill of officers varies with their natural ability and the extent of their meteorological education. One of the serious defects of the science is the comparatively low pay of officers who undertake so serious a responsibility. Resignations or other changes at times make it necessary to put men in charge who lack the many years of practice and the thorough training necessary for so difficult a task. It is well to remember that failures to forecast the weather are exceptional, and that the average result is unquestionably valuable. 

New York's Great Blizzard. In the United States and part of Canada, the situation of a great storm, like the New York blizzard of March 11th and 12th, is promptly reported by telegraph three times daily. The rate of progress made by the storm and the velocity of the wind are then known almost hourly, and their probable course foreseen to an average extent of about 68 percent correctness for thirty-two hours in advance. The storm track of the great New York blizzard was traced from the very slight atmospheric disturbance at San Francisco to the hurricane of cold air and snow that swept down upon New York City and Long Island. The path of the blizzard and its growing severity were at once drawn upon the Signal Service tri-daily weather maps until it came within three or four hundred miles of New York City, when the fury of the storm became so great that telegraphic communication was very largely interrupted, only here and there a report coming in. There was no combination of reports from adjacent stations whereby the exact movement of the storm center could be then known. Its path and severity through New York and the New England states could not be plotted on the Signal Service map on the morning of the 15th. But the missing data have been gradually filled in to an extent that reveals the remarkable nature of this storm, which in the peculiarity of its track as well as in the velocity of its wind force is unequaled since the establishment of the Signal Service as a regular organization in 1870. In the weather map of March 12th, the storm began to manifest its first indications of power in Southern Colorado on the 11th, where it split into two storm centers of five or six hundred miles in diameter, one center moving southward, along the Gulf, and up the Atlantic coast to New York, the other moving northeast, over the Great Lakes, and on to the same destination. The two storms seem to have been kept apart by the Appalachian ranges of mountains for at least the distance from northern Georgia to northern Pennsylvania. Both steadily increased in severity as they approached their point of reunion at New York City. The southerly storm that came up the Atlantic coast was the more severe, as evinced by the destruction to vessels in the Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River. On the morning of March 10th, indications of tremendous storm energy were apparent, extending from Arkansas to northern Wisconsin and Michigan. Warm and cold bodies of air were distilled, with marked contrasts of temperature, over narrow areas of regions running north and south for 2,000 miles or more. A venerable sergeant of the Signal Service, a veteran of the Civil War, once pointed to a weather map and said to the writer: "If it were not midwinter, I would say that tornadoes would result from that map"; and great loss of life on the lakes took place from the severe winter storm that the old sergeant had foreseen. The warm air ought to remain south and the cold air north, and whenever the map denotes that this normal distribution is nearly reversed, there is sure to be a combat during the restoration of the equilibrium. The Dakota blizzard of January 12th and 19th was very severe, but its field of operations was much lessened by its...

Truck forming a short sharp curve through the Northwest, almost doubling back upon itself, as will be seen on the map. The wind blew at a rate of from thirty to sixty miles an hour, and at some points there was a fall of 18 inches in temperature in twenty-four hours. With a temperature of from 40 to 30 below zero and a furious wind blowing, it is not surprising that the loss of life was great. Not even signals accustomed to an arctic temperature could endure it. The number of lives lost was greater than in previous storms owing to the increased number of travelers, and because the blizzard came on in the morning about 10, when people were away from home. Mild weather for two or three days had thrown them off their guard. The Signal Service cannot warn the people of Dakota in these emergencies because there are no chains of stations in that bleak region north of the Canada line, from which a cold wave or a blizzard can descend upon the people with dangerous rapidity. The blinding snow, even by daylight, is equivalent to absolute darkness. Adequate meteorological stations north of the Canada line might result in saving many lives, owing to timely warnings by telegraph; otherwise life in Dakota in midwinter must continue to be extremely hazardous.

1889-01-19: A.V. Wiman, of this city, and Mr. Erastus Wiman on the subject of the designs of the latter upon the commercial and political integrity of the Dominion. From the day he started the agitation of the trade relations between Canada and the United States, Mr. Wiman has been playing a double game. To Canadians, he has professed the utmost solicitude for the material prosperity and national welfare, and has given as the motive of his active propagation of the commercial union project a desire to extend the trade and develop the resources of the Dominion without impairing her legislative independence. His eulogies of the soil, climate, resources, and capabilities of our country have been glowing to the length of gush, and ostensibly no truer or more disinterested friend of the Canadian people than Mr. Wiman lived. But for his audiences in the United States, he had another object. Commercial union he first freely preached to them, not as a scheme to benefit Canadians, but as a certain and sure means of giving American manufacturers control of the markets of Canada. He praised and extolled the vast latent wealth of the Dominion, indeed, but the means were designed to excite the cupidity of the Americans. Annexation has been the goal of Mr. Wiman's efforts from the beginning of his work. He is shrewd enough to understand that anything savoring of annexation will be summarily rejected by the people of this country, and he has carefully endeavored to disguise his motive with honeyed phrases and professions of American loyalty; but the double game has been so transparent and so difficult to play for any length of time that Mr. Wiman appears at last to have thrown off the mask. How any sane man could ever have regarded the commercial union movement as other than an annexation plot passes understanding. The very essential part of the whole scheme is the surrender by Canada of control of the tariff, and assuming the attitude of a pensioner on the bounty of Washington; and only a fool or a knave can think of maintaining such a position with the maintenance of the political integrity of the Dominion. Mr. Wiman in openly propounding annexation has put himself in line with Senators Sherman and Blair, with Lutterworth and Blaine, with the American politicians to whom he has been wont to point as prepared to extend to Canada his scheme of commercial union. Annexation is understandable; it is the honest avowal of the purpose and intent of the new trade policy our Liberal friends have espoused, but it is not a destiny which Canadians are prepared to accept. 

As supplementing the views of Mr. Wiman published yesterday in our Toronto correspondence, we give the following report of this gentleman's latest public appearance: 

New York, January 10. Mr. Erastus Wiman was before the members and friends of the Lincoln Club, Brooklyn, last night, and told them the reasons why the United States should include Canada. He talked for two hours on his pet scheme, but did it so entertainingly that nobody grew tired. In introducing Mr. Wiman, President William Herri said it was evident that Mr. Wiman was very much in earnest in support of the annexation of Canada to the United States, for he had offered, at his own expense, to take the Canadian Parliament through the United States that they might see its greatness and be impressed by it to favor union. In his address, Mr. Wiman made some comparisons which somewhat surprised his audience. In giving them an idea of Hudson Bay, he told them to think of a bay which began at New York and ended at Chicago. The canal at Sault Ste. Marie, he said, did more business last year than did the Suez Canal. It seemed by his glowing description that the only hope for the future greatness of the United States was its annexation to Canada. He said the potatoes of Canada were much larger than those of the United States, that Canada had more sun than the rest of North America, and that it was free from any chance of drought by natural provision. The wheat of Canada more than equaled the cotton of the South, and its iron was better than that of any other country, and this country wouldn't have to send to Spain for iron if the Canadian mines were properly developed. After praising the natural greatness of Canada as an inducement for annexation, Mr. Wiman spoke of the political reasons. Silence is golden, especially Mr. Francis Langelier's Montreal's ice palace has suffered badly from the warm weather; but preparations for the great carnival still go on. Montreal is not St. Paul. The Opposition cause does not seem to be so strong as its talk in Manitoba. The party has no straight nominee in the November bye-election. As a direct advocate of annexation, Mr. Wiman occupies no new position. It is years since he publicly regretted that the Declaration of Independence stopped short at line 45. Liberal journals are busy advising their friends to look after the revision of the voters' lists. Conservatives had better keep an eye on the mortuary records and see that no townships have double voting powers conferred upon them. The Herald formally announces that Hon. Henry Barnes will shortly occupy the seat and draw the salary of Speaker of the Legislative Council. Would it not have been kinder to have waited a little? It was only on Tuesday the vote was given. Old Boreas has taken a wild revenge on the boisterous Dakotans. The mail accounts of their fan and linen duster picnics are not done coming east when the mercury has gone down to 42 below zero on the inhabitants of the blizzard afflicted state. Mr. Murder's bill to increase the chances of escape for the political corruptionist becomes quite a mild little thing beside the provision for wholesale corruption that his lieutenant, Piletier, thinks the law should contain. The revenue police report that one-fourth of the licensed hotels and restaurants they have inspected fail to meet the requirements of the law. This should afford an opportunity for reducing the excessive number. There can be no vested right in an illegally maintained business. The German Emperor's idea of discharging all the French cooks of the palace just because they are French is about on a level with that of the statesmen of the Kansas Legislature who proposed to change the titles of the chancellor and regents of the state university just because they happen to be similar to those borne by men in like positions in England. Neither French cookery nor English scholarship is likely to suffer from the execution of those designs of little men in high places. In reply to "The Last Word" of the Quebec Chronicle, Mr. J. Israel Tarte says over his own signature in L'Événement, "Do you have finished, while I am only beginning? My evidence in court was, in your opinion, incomplete. If I should speak of the masqueraders that practice political assassination in the dark, who with money get compromising personages out of the way, and close the mouths of dangerous witnesses by means that I know of!" At this point, Mr. Tarte leaves the public to make its own interpretation of these dark hints. Even Liberals must now admit the usefulness of the veto power when it is exercised in circumstances like those of the District Magistrates' Act. The new bill is so framed as to avoid some mistakes of its predecessor. It does not undertake, for instance, to abolish the Montreal Circuit Court, nor does it attempt to rob the Superior Court judges of any portion of their jurisdiction. The last act was clearly ultra vires by the terms of section 96 of the British North America Act, which gives to the Governor-General the power of nominating judges of the Superior, District, and County Courts in every province. The new bill has been more carefully framed. Yesterday, Talleyrand joined Mississippi, L'Assomption, and Barrie, the Quebec counties that have declared for unrestricted reciprocity since that policy became an issue in the country, and Prince Edward, Kent, and Halton in Ontario, so that the strengthening of this policy is such as to cause alarm on the Treasury benches. The policy may cause alarm on the Treasury benches, if the occupants thereof forget that "since that policy became an issue in the country," those have declared against it. East Huron and South Victoria, Restigouche and Digby, South Renfrew and Charlotte, Colchester and Cumberland, Haliburton, Victoria, and K...

BAR & CO., 738 Craig Street, Montreal: It has been triumphantly proved that the Sprague system of electric railways can be successfully operated in all conditions of weather, and this last straw, which a few railroad men are making as an excuse for not giving patrons better transportation at an admitted less cost than by horse or mule power, is gone.

ELECTRICITY ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. 

Davenport Tribune, Jan 10, 1889 (Morning paper): "Where are the croakers now? Yesterday morning when the rain ceased, the street and hills became coated with ice, then it was doubtful to many if the cars would be able to ascend the Brady Street hill, but they did not remain long in doubt, for the electric cars went up and down the hill at their usual speed. When the first car started over the line, an interesting pyrotechnic display appeared on the trolley wire: the passage of the current melting the ice and emitting a bluish flame. As we are likely to have a snowstorm this evening or tomorrow, our citizens will get an opportunity of judging how it operated in deep snow." 

Extract from Davenport Democrat Gazette, January 10, 1889 (Evening paper): "Snow has fallen on an average by daylight 8 to 10 inches, it was heavy and damp. The wind drifted it considerably. Long before daylight, street railroad men were at work with their snow plows. It was hard work."

(Copy of a Letter) Davenport Central Railway Company, Davenport, January 6, 1880

Sprague Electric Railway & Motor Company, Chicago, IL

GENTLEMEN, We have had as bad a snowstorm as far as street railroading is concerned, as is usually encountered in this section of the country, which you know is subject to very heavy snow and ice storms. Our cars made the usual time, while the horse cars ran slowly on their lines on a practically level road, and could not attain any speed over a walk all day. We naturally felt jubilant over our grand success. The president of a prominent Iowa street railway line was here today inspecting the system. He declared that it was not possible to do with horses what we did with electricity today. As we telegraphed you, our citizens are so jubilant over the grand success. The wind was very strong and blew the snow back on the tracks almost as fast as it was cleaned off. The only difference that we could notice in the propulsion of the cars was that, at our power plant, it took 50 percent more all day long to propel the cars. We would not have minded it had it taken 100 percent increase; we were so pleased at being able to satisfy ourselves and the public even in a blizzard. When any railroad men are in doubt when you assert to them, as you did to us, that you can operate better in a snow or sleet storm than cars propelled by horses, refer them to us, and we will only be too pleased to verify your assertions.

Yours truly, Davenport Central Railway Company, W. ALLEN, President

18890204: THE WEATHER PROPOSITIONS Carnival! 1880 will bring all predecessors' troop of visitors in the city. The week's panorama (Written for the Montreal Gazette) When Dickens wrote Italian scenes and pictured Rome in hues of light, an all-mill grandeur intervenes 'Twixt squalid art and glory. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

---

**The Coliseum's mighty strength,  
Its stately, lordly dome,  
Arise in contrast, till at length  
I see all monumental Rome.  
He leaves the ruins to decay,  
The Forum's pillars tall a while,  
The relics by the Appian Way,  
The Pantheon's antiquated pile;  
All disappear, the scene is new.  
King Carnival in costume strides,  
And on that wizard page we view  
How masquerade in splendor glides.  
Along the Corso sweeps the mass  
Of jubilant revelers, even there  
Across the yellow Tiber pass  
A peddler's flash and noise and glare.  
Along the bridge of St. Angelo,  
And the Palatine they rise,  
In the Piazza Popolo,  
Where modern palaces surprise.  
Rome masks and dominoes and din,  
Ariadne carriages, four abreast,  
Sweet flowers without, bon-bon within,  
And steeds in endless garlands dressed.  
And noise from hundred instruments,  
Amidst clatter, shouts, and wildest glee,  
Fantastic females, goblin gents,  
And hideous monsters, all we see.  
The sun on broad Campagna sets,  
Ten thousand rockets hiss in air,  
A fiery column here besets  
A palace built of prisms there.  
The pyrotechnic scene unrolled  
Beyond Arabian visions bright,  
When Lent's great bell is slowly tolled,  
And all the splendors fade in night.  
Not so our own Canadian scene!  
No sweet Italian zephyrs bland;  
A shroud of white on fields of green,  
The Ice-King reigns o'er all the land.  
But blue and deep Canadian sky,  
And crystal splendors 'round us glow!  
The Forest-god, in accents high,  
Proclaims the Carnival of Snow!  
One hundred feet of carved ice,  
The stately tower and walls appear,  
With motto, flags, and quaint device,  
The wintry palace columns rear.  
Its lordly roof, the stalactites,  
Pure icicles, like prisms seem;  
And from below the stalagmites,  
In bright electric glories gleam.  
Behold that frosty palace now,  
In floods of light of rainbow hue;  
With joy in the masked skate show,  
And, dancing, glide in grand review.  
Then music in voluptuous swell  
Gives life to every changing scene;  
The throb of timbrel, sound of bell,  
And roars of laughter intervene.  
Then clad in deerskin moccasins,  
With blanket coats and tuques of blue,  
On snowshoe tramps, loggans they go,  
The kids their divers sports pursue;  
Around the mountain, Indian file,  
Or down the inclined plane they glide;  
Mid frost or snow, and ice, they smile  
In Winter's northern blizzard pride.  
The curlers to the rink repair,  
With brooms and stones to push their game;  
Kite lanterns brightly flare,  
Without, the streets are all a-tame.  
Talk not of Carnivals in Rome,  
Or in that mellow Southern clime;  
Give us our Carnival at home,  
Our glorious air, our winter time!  
And thousands flock that dream to see;  
Kaleidoscopic splendors crowd  
Upon the senses gloriously;  
And mirth is rich and rare and loud.  
The Roman Carnival ascends,  
Like rocket, in a flash of light,  
Then midst confusion, soon descends,  
And fades in penitential night.  
And like its icy palace, ours  
Is brilliant for a glowing space;  
Then warmer suns and April showers  
All relics of its pride efface.

**Everything in Readiness**  
The city hotels were all astir on Saturday afternoon and evening and yesterday, testifying to the large number of strangers that had come to the city for the Carnival which opens today. Among the visitors are many old-time Montrealers who have been away from the city for years, and they one and all express wonderment at the improvement of the city. Today trains will pour in hundreds at the three depots, and the hotels will fill up to their utmost limits. The arrangements made for the great influx of visitors are very complete, and will doubtless prove highly satisfactory in the prevention of anything like confusion or disappointment. Both the railway companies have made special arrangements for the regulation of public sleighs during the week.  

**L. White, abandoned off Delaware Bay, March 13, during the great "blizzard."**  
All her crew were rescued, and the vessel, with masts and portions of her sails standing and ensign set, with union down, drifted off to the southeast before the northwest gale. Upon reaching the Gulf Stream she turned away to the eastward and commenced her long cruise toward Europe, directly in the track of the thousands of vessels engaged in transatlantic commerce, and now, after an interval of ten months and ten days, she has completed her voyage and lies stranded on the coast of Lewis Island, one of the Hebrides. In her cruise of ten months and ten days she traversed a distance of more than five thousand miles, was reported forty-five times, and how many more times vessels passed dangerously near her at night and in thick weather cannot even be estimated. The cruise of this derelict, as indicated by the very complete records in the Hydrographic office, is by far the most interesting on record. To be free from sick headache, biliousness, constipation, etc., use Carter's Little Liver Pills. Strictly vegetable. They gently stimulate the liver and free the stomach from bile.

**Enjoying the Day at the Rinks**  
The continuation of Tuesday's storm, which developed from an ordinary snowstorm into an infant blizzard early yesterday morning, again did another good turn for the rinks. All day yesterday the different rinks were filled with the sounds of the scurrying of many feet, and it was not until the attack on the palace began that they were three more silent. At the Victoria matters were exceedingly lively. A good band, a good sheet of ice, and crowds of merry skaters created the amusement of the day for the Carnival visitors, a large number of whom were present. One gentleman, hailing from New York, who had previously passed some rather severe criticisms on the appearance of Montreal's fair sex, after making the circuit of the rink twice, remarked to his friend that he "would have to reiterate what he had said regarding the appearance of the young ladies of Montreal, as he had never seen so many pretty girls under one roof before," and glancing down the rink at two little girls who were waltzing to the popular air the band was then playing, he added, "Yes, and they can skate, too!" Some of the waltzing performed yesterday afternoon drew forth exclamations of surprise from the many Americans present. Among the visitors during the afternoon were His Excellency the Governor-General, Lady Stanley and the different members of His Excellency's party, and that of General Sir John Ross, who all partook of 5 o'clock tea in the directors' room. Mr. Louis Rubenstein, the world's champion fancy skater, was also present, and gave an exhibition of his marvelous skating before His Excellency, at the end of which he was presented by President Hemphill to His Excellency, who expressed his thanks and complimented Mr. Rubenstein very highly upon his proficiency. The vice-regal party left the rink soon after six. The skaters were by this time all at the Victoria rink and anyone who peeped into the Dominion rink would find large numbers of skaters thoroughly enjoying themselves.

**The British Embassy, Washington, February 9**  
No information has been received at the State Department in regard to the appointment of a British minister to this country. The department has, however, been informed that Mr. Edwards, first secretary of legation at Washington, who has been in London for some time, has sailed for this country. On his arrival here he will assume charge of the affairs of the legation. His return at this particular time is understood by certain officials to mean that there is no immediate prospect of the appointment of a successor to Lord Sackville.  

**The Remains of a Noted Gang of Counterfeiters**  
Pittsburgh, February 9  
United States Detective Sweeney and Deputy Marshal Chambers arrived here today with thirteen counterfeiters, who were captured in Butler County during the past ten days. Several other members of the gang are yet to be apprehended. It took about twenty-five officers to make the arrests, as the men are desperate characters. The band was regarded as one of the most dangerous and successful in the country. Thousands upon thousands of dollars of bogus coin have been passed in different states by the counterfeiters.  

**Can Canada Equal This?**  
Reading, PA, February 9  
The sheriff of Berks County yesterday sold ten fine farms in this county, aggregating nearly one thousand acres. During the present winter the sheriff has sold some twenty other large farms, besides the stock of twenty farmers, all of whom had failed. This indicates that farming no longer pays, as a similar state of affairs exists in other counties in this section of the state.  

**A Fight for Life**  
Portland, ME, February 9  
The fishing schooner Herbert M. Rogers, of Gloucester, had a terrible experience on Wednesday night in the storm off Thatcher's Light. The crew were forced to chop all night at the rapidly forming ice in order to keep the schooner afloat. When they reached this port, the vessel and men plainly showed the effects of their fight for life in the blizzard.

Minor Items
Prices of Lehigh coal have been cut down 25 cents per ton. The Ohio and Western Coal and Iron Company has failed. The Dakota Legislature has defeated the Woman Suffrage bill. The engineers of the Minneapolis Motor Street Railway are on strike. Minister Phelps and wife arrived in New York on Saturday from England. The ravages of pneumonia in Granite, Mont, are terrible. The doctors seem unable to control the disease. The bursting of a centrifugal machine in the works of the New York Tartar Company, Brooklyn, killed two men and wounded three others on Saturday. The Philadelphia Coal and Iron Company has been awarded the contract supplying the United States Government with three thousand tons of anthracite coal, delivered at Samoa. The managers of the Nicaragua Canal Company say they will begin work as soon as President Cleveland signs the bill incorporating the company. They have a preliminary fund of $2,000,000. 

At Hutchinson, Kansas, a pretty eighteen-year-old girl, who gives her name as Cora Wilson, has been arrested for passing counterfeit money. She says she is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister in Ohio. The Bronko Iron Company, of Birdboro, Pa, has reduced the wages of their puddlers from $3.25 to $3 per ton. This is the lowest figure paid since the panic. Nearly 200 men are affected and they do not seem inclined to accept. The mills at Pottstown and other places recently made similar reductions. Anillo Redmond, who was kidnapped from her parents in Chicago over a year ago, and whose father has gone insane over her loss, was recovered on Saturday. She had been abducted by a rascally captor, who brutally abused her. On seeing his child again, the father recovered his senses. The kidnappers were arrested.

A NEWSPAPER DEAL
The Winnipeg Free Press' Keen Resignation
Morning Monopoly, Winnipeg, February 10 — The air has been full of rumors the last few days in reference to the Morning Call as it was understood offers had been made for it by the local Government and the Free Press Company. Late on Saturday night it was announced that Acton Burrows, representing the Call shareholders, had sold the plant and franchise to the Free Press. The plant includes the whole outfit of the Morning and Weekly Call and a large job office, the whole having been put in new last summer after the Call's fire. The Call owned the franchise of the United Press and Press News, which combined with the Associated Press held by the Free Press, now gives that paper a monopoly of the morning field here. The consideration is said to be $64,400. Mr. Luxton will remain editor-in-chief of the Free Press. Mr. Burrows will wind up the affairs of the Call Company, and after that will probably take active charge of the Norwest Farmer Company, of which he is the principal stockholder. It is almost certain the local Government will get a paper established in their interest, but it will have to take an evening field. The Free Press contemplates getting out an evening edition at an early date.

18890214: H. Ottsman's Donnybrook has also been declared out of the Suburban, Sheepshead Bay and Bay Ridge handicaps. Despite the blizzard that was blowing yesterday afternoon, eight men stepped to the score on the Montreal Gun Club grounds. It was the eighth handicap competition for the club greeter, and as Cowicy had already two liens on it, he was looked upon as a probable winner, but he was not allowed to get the gun without a struggle for it. The scores do not come up to the average, but when the blustering weather is considered, they were very good indeed. The winners of previous competitions with their scores were: 1

United States Grain Markets
There was more activity in the Chicago wheat market and a larger volume of trading was transacted but a weaker feeling prevailed, and prices declined slightly, closing at 60c May, 61 jo June, 60c July. Corn was quiet and easier, and fell off 1c, closing at 35c May, 35c June, 30c July. On the other hand, oats were stronger and moved up 1c, closing at 25c May, 26c June, 25c July. Today's inspection was 40 car winter wheat, 23 spring, 341 command, 108 oats. Macdongall Bros, stock brokers and members of the Chicago Board of Trade, have received the following dispatch from A. Geddes & Co., their Chicago agents: 

June weather in March has quite a depressing effect on all our markets. It is too good to last. Wheat broke at two cents, closing a cent lower than yesterday. At the moment there is no encouragement to buy. Our private advices report heavy sales throughout California and prospects excellent. Foreign markets are heavy. Corn dull; no marked change. Provisions dull and easier. Warm weather unfavorable for packing operations.

New York, March 14 — The blizzard which the bulls have been looking for got lost en route, and the finer weather than expected has thawed out more long stuff, with a consequent decline of 1c this morning. The wheeling is still very soft for the market, which breaks through at every step under the load of long stuff. The road still looks very muddy and full of pitfalls, with Chicago 2c higher than New York, instead of 8c lower than New York, as it ought to be on a normal basis. How this breach of 10c is to be adjusted with a foreign demand not in the calculation is the interesting problem which has already worn out many pencils and exhausted the patience of the $3 bulls, who are now watching with increasing interest the deepening color of the bluebird's wing and wondering what relation there is between the pussy willows now blooming in this vicinity and the unsold and at present prices unsaleable stocks of wheat and flour, while the sower already is going forth to sow.

The New York wheat market was weaker and declined 1c, closing at 91c March, 92c April, 93c May, 94c June, 90c July. Corn dropped 1c, closing at 42c March, 43c April, 43c May, 43c June. Oats closed at 30c April, 30c May, 30c June. Ocean freight to Liverpool by steam was strong and higher at 3d per bushel. At Toledo, wheat was weak and dropped 3c, No. 2 red closing at 95-97c cash, 92c May, 92c June, 80c July, 85c August. Corn was dull, closing at 34c cash, 34c April, 35c May. Oats were unchanged, No. 1 white at Detroit was weak and broke 1c, closing at 98c cash. At Milwaukee, wheat fell off 1c, closing at 80c cash, 80c March, 87c May.

Montreal Grain and Flour
Owing to the weak western markets and the continued quiet advices from abroad, there was little life in the local grain market. Buyers held off and showed little disposition to take hold. In wheat, business was quiet and prices steady. Corn was slow and unchanged. Prices were dull, with offerings light. Oats met with a moderate demand at quotations. We quote Canadian spring wheat, $1.20; red winter wheat, $1.23-28; white, $1.23-28; No. 1 hard Manitoba, $1.33-35; No. 2 do, $1.30-31; peas, 67-68c per 56 lbs; oats, 32-33c; corn, 45-46c in bond; barley, 50-53c. There was no important change in the flour market to note. The demand was slow and the market quiet with little business outside of a small jobbing trade. Prices were steady all around. Manitoba strong bakers' was fairly enquired for, but no large sales were reported. Patent winter $8.78-90; full patent spring $6.29-00; high patent roller $6.40-110; extra $6.16-26; straight $4.26-30; city strong bakers' $6.10-20; strong bakers' $5.80-8.30 (seconds) $6.00.

18890321: LONDON MONEY MARKET. The Economist of March 9 says: "Apart from the uncertainty that has been imported into it by the financial crisis in Paris, the condition of our money market has not altered during the past week. The bank return shows a falling off in the amount of the reserve, due to the expansion of the internal circulation of notes and coin, but that is only what was to be expected at the beginning of the month. And in the course of a week or two, we shall see a still larger expansion, for the Government payments are always heavy toward the end of the quarter, and there are other movements of money that draw coin and notes from the bank and put them into circulation. In ordinary course, therefore, the bank reserve should be considerably reduced between now and the end of the quarter, and this will serve to bring into greater prominence the fact that the bank has not yet succeeded in attracting gold hither from abroad. A considerable amount of the metal is now on its way to Europe, but it was always doubtful if much of that would find its way to the bank; and the doubt must be all the greater now, when the financial difficulties in Paris will make the continental banks anxious to strengthen their position. For although, with the help of the other grand banks, the Comptoir d'Escompte has arranged to meet the run upon it, and has satisfied the claims of nearly all its depositors, its difficulties have not been surmounted. Indeed, its most serious troubles have yet to be faced, for it is burdened with a load of copper which has fallen fully 20 percent in price during the past few days, and, what is still worse, with onerous responsibilities in connection with its guarantees of contracts entered into by the Société des Métaux. The position in Paris thus remains extremely critical, and although, in any case, there is no reason to expect much disturbance to our money market, still the situation is one which calls for the exercise of great caution."

COMMERCIAL GAZETTE OFFICE, Wednesday Evening. Europe. H. B. Stebbins' cable today says: Cargoes off east, wheat very dull. Corn, slow. Cargoes on passage and for shipment, wheat and corn very little demand. California wheat, off coast, 37s; California wheat promptly to be shipped, 36s; California wheat, nearly due, 37s. French country markets steady. Liverpool wheat, spot very flat. Corn do, weaker. Liverpool standard California wheat, including club white, 7s 4d-7s 7d. Mark Lane English and foreign wheat weaker. Mark Lane American and Danubian prices quieter. Mark Lane English and American flour weaker. Australian wheat off coast 88s; present and following month, 88s 6d. Chilian wheat off coast, 36s 3d; present and following month, 30s 3d. Walla Walla wheat off coast, 36s 3d; present and following month, 36s 3d. London, March 18. The Mark Lane Express, in its weekly review of the British grain trade, says: English wheat values are lower. It is frequently impossible to effect sales. Prices in Scotland are even lower than in England. The sales of English wheat during the past week were 61,423 quarters at 30s 2d, against 77,228 quarters at 30s 6d, during the corresponding week last year. Most foreign wheat fell 1d. Flour is weak, although the supply of foreign is moderate. In London, barley has declined a fraction. In a majority of the country markets, prices have hardened. A large quantity of corn causes weakness in some cases, while in others prices are in sellers' favor. Oats have improved 3d-5d. The demand does not equal the hopes of holders. Rye is a trifle firmer. Beans are a little weaker. At today's market, English wheat was in moderate request at last Monday's prices. Foreign was weaker. There was no speculation. Flour was unchanged. The recent arrivals are not satisfactory, and drag. Barley was steady. Round corn was in fair retail request at the very low prices accepted last Monday. Flat corn was 3d cheaper on the week. There was a very small fresh supply of oats, and prices advanced 3d. Beans and peas were dull. Rye was steady. In the very latest dealings, breadstuff and corn were weaker. United States Grain Markets. In the Chicago wheat market, a stronger feeling prevailed and prices advanced 1-2c. The market was fairly active, and trading was more lively, closing at 83 1/2c May, 92c June, 89c July. Corn was quiet but firmer, and improved 1/4c, closing at 35c May, 36c June, 35c July. Oats were weaker and eased off 1/4c, except for the May option, which moved up 1/4c, closing at 25c May, 24 1/4c June, 24 1/4c July. Today's inspection was 14 cars winter wheat, 13 spring, 412 corn, and 124 oats. Macdougall Bros., stock brokers and members of the Chicago Board of Trade, have received the following dispatch from A. Goddard & Co., their Chicago agents: Wheat was firmer, though outside reports continue bearish. Our private cable reports that California cargoes arriving on French account are pressing on the English markets for sale. Hence we cannot look for much support from abroad. At the same time, there is danger in being short in the market. There is money under it, and the trade is liable to go a surprise any day. Corn was heavy, though there appears to be good buying orders at 35c for May. Provisions were stronger. Pork is seemingly well held and is likely to sell higher; closed at $12.25 May. James R. Barclay & Co., grain and stock and provision brokers, No. 18 St. Sacrament street, report the Chicago market as follows: 

Wheat - May, June, July. 
Corn - May, June, July. 
Oats - May, June, July. 
Pork - May, June, July. 
Lard - May, June, July. 

It was just about this time a year ago that contracts for May wheat were being kicked around. The April 10th Government report came out, and before anybody knew it, the price of May was up 10c or more. While this doesn't prove anything as to what will happen this year, it will do for a reminder. The great blizzard of last March got lost on its way here this year, although many people prepared for it; just as the same superstition is at work now in predictions of a big rise to follow the April crop report. Preparations for it will do much to avert it. However, good thinkers are going slow, at 62c for May wheat as sellers. It is the long wheat that is on top of the market now, and not the shorts. It broke the market down this morning. The shorts furnished the principal buyers, although some of the local traders bought for a turn. It looks as if there was too much long stuff in the market for any permanent or considerable rally. On January 1, 1889, France held in seaport granaries close upon 10,000,000 bushels of wheat; this during January was reduced to 12,000,000 bushels; but the receipts in February have been considerable, and the present stocks in "bond" cannot be far off 34,000,000 bushels. The ice and swollen state of the rivers have interfered with wider mills. The Indian market is quiet. Recent rains have improved crop prospects in the northwest, and an average yield is expected which would allow for shipment equal to the season now closing. There will be a short supply of Bombay soft grades; otherwise, the outlook is fairly satisfactory. Since January 1, Bombay and Karachi have sent to Europe about 3,700,000 bushels, of which about 1,410,000 were for the continent, against about 1,040,000 bushels for those ports during the same period last year. There is now on passage for Europe 2,206,000 bushels, against 604,000 bushels in 1888. The continued outpour of long wheat kept the market in weak and unsettled condition throughout the session. Exporters were moderate buyers (eight loads) of cash stuff; two loads for Scotch ports and the rest for Lisbon. At the seaboard, wheat was stronger and moved up, closing at 90c March, 90 1/2c April, 91c May, 92c June. Corn was weaker and fell off 1/2c, closing at 42c March, 42c April, 42 1/2c May, 43c June, 43c July. Oats closed at 30 1/2c March, 30c April, 30c May, 30c June. Ocean freights to Liverpool by steam were steady at 3d per bushel. In Toledo, wheat was weaker and declined 1/2c, No. 1 red closing at 91c cash, 90c May, 89c June, 85c July, 84c August. Corn closed at 33 1/2c cash, 33c May. Oats were nominal, No. 1 white at Detroit was weak and broke 1c, closing at 90c cash. At Milwaukee, wheat improved 1/2c, closing at 86 1/2c cash, 86c March, 87 1/2c. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

May - Montreal Grain Market - In the local grain market, business was quiet owing to the limited demand, and few sales were effected. Advice from abroad was quiet and weaker, with prices lower, while the western markets were stronger and higher. There was no change here, prices being steady all round. The demand for wheat was quiet, and only a few car lots were placed at quotations. Corn and peas were neglected and unchanged. There was a fair inquiry for oats, and car lots changed hands at 32c-32½c. Barley was dull and unchanged. We quote: Canadian spring wheat, $1.20; red winter wheat, $1.23-$1.25; white, $1.23-$1.28; No. 1 hard Manitoba, $1.33-$1.35; No. 2 do, $1.30-$1.31; peas, 67c-68c per 60 lbs; oats, 32c-32½c; corn, 45c-46c in bulk; barley, 50c-53c. The Winnipeg Commercial says: "In sympathy with the great weakness outside, prices in Manitoba markets were lower. Prices paid to farmers at provincial points were dropped about 60 cents during the week, and now average about 91c per bushel for No. 1 hard, against an average of $1 last week. In the different provincial markets, deliveries were very light, and business in wheat at primary points is thought to be about over until after seeding. Opinions, of course, differ widely as to the quantity of wheat being held for summer marketing, but it is thought to be even lighter than usual." The feeling in the flour market has continued to be easy, and holders generally were offering more freely at somewhat lower prices, but holders held off as they did not feel disposed to take hold. In consequence, the market was dull, with only a small jobbing trade in progress. There were no sales reported on 'Change. Patent winter $5.78; patent spring, $6.20; straight roller, $5.50; extra $6.15; superfine $4.85; city strong bakers' $6.00; strong bakers', $6.50; range bakers', bags, $3.80; napkins, bags, $2.00; extra bags $2.30; oatmeal, standard, per bag $6.00; oatmeal, granulated, per bag $6.00-$6.50; $5.80; $6.25; $4.75; $6.10; $8.00; $2.86; $2.26; $2.80; $2.00; $2.10.

18890322: JOHNS Hope for Hay Ulmatu-Ayr A factory - The Military School (From a correspondent) The great motive advocated by those wishing to have the military school removed here is the lack of a rifle range. Now, we are not to understand, I hope, that there is no way of effecting a remedy. Long ago, in a report made by Col. d'Orsonnens to the military authorities, the fact of our being without a rifle range here was dwelt on, and this drawback was clearly demonstrated; but, on the other hand, a suggestion was made concerning the estate Langolior property, which is perfectly adapted for a rifle range. The Minister of Militia has had the matter in hand ever since, and he is the one to decide the time and place concerning this matter, the opinion of the correspondent of the Canadian Militia Gazette to the contrary notwithstanding. The suggestion of the commandant was at the time supported by some of the citizens here, and the Minister of Militia knows what offers were made in view of securing the property in question, which for a mere nominal rental can be utilized for a rifle range. The matter could be fixed very quickly yet, and as soon as the minister decides it won't take long to do it. Should any aid from the corporation be required, I have no doubt that our City fathers will extend their courteous support, as they have intimated they are ready to do. The school will remain here, and it is without any doubt the most advantageous situation, at any point of view, of any in the whole Dominion. At least the outlook is much brighter concerning the early settlement of the Hay claims. Mr. Charles Arpin has received a letter from an Oswego counselor-at-law, who is working on the claims, who says: "I have just returned from Washington, and I consider the outlook brighter as far as regards claimants in the United States." No doubt claimants in the United States will have the preference over Canadian claimants from their government, especially now that the latter has appointed Mr. Walter O. Blaine, son of the Secretary of State, to the high position of adjuster of claims against the United States government. But on the other hand, the question at stake is one of national honor and justice, and Canadians will not be long kept waiting. It looks now as if we were to be benefited by the business of the Messrs. Ayer & Co., of Lowell, Mass. Mr. Mansfield, the agent, who was interviewed a few days ago at the Balmoral by Acting Mayor Arpin, gave him to understand that between the shoe factory building and the Bertrand property, the house would make a choice site, and locate likely in St. Johns. Mr. Arpin suggested to Mr. Mansfield to offer to Messrs. Ayer an exemption from municipal taxes for a series of years if they would come here, and also to build at the corporation's expense a drain for either of those properties. No better place could be selected by the Messrs. Ayer than St. Johns. The labor is already centered here, where the firm carried on their business for a great many seasons. Labor is cheaper here than it would be in a large city. The properties in question are situated along the railway, from which a large amount of hauling can be saved every year. Freight rates are just as low here as from Montreal, and there is no better distributing point. Boxes for packing can be had at less than city prices, and the exemption from taxes alone is quite an item compared to what taxes would be on such an enterprise in a large city.

LOST IN THIS STORM One of our local editors clipped from a leading magazine extracts from a vivid description of a western blizzard which we take the liberty to publish and suggest to H. H. Warner & Co., the proprietors of the celebrated Warner's Safe Cure, the feasibility of an extract for the introduction of one of their telling advertisements. The following is the description: "At the close of a dark day in January, a solitary horseman wends his way across the open prairie in one of our western territories. He passes at long intervals the lone cabin of the hardy frontiersman. Two or three old settlers, of whom he has inquired the way, have warned him that a storm is approaching, and with true western hospitality, urge him to accept shelter for the night. But he declines the proffered kindness and urges his tired horse forward. The sky grows suddenly dark. The storm increases in its fury. The rider dismounts to warm his numb chilling limbs. He can scarcely breathe. Drowsiness steals over him. The end is near. He is lost in the blizzard." The terror which seizes the bewildered traveler is similar to that which overcomes one when he learns that he is suffering from an advanced kidney disease, and is informed that he is in the last stages of Bright's disease. At first, he is informed that he has a slight kidney affection. Later, he begins to feel tired (slight headache), fickle appetite, failure of eyesight, cramp in the calf of the legs, wakefulness, distressing nervousness, rheumatic and neuralgic pains, occasionally pain in the back, scanty, dark-colored fluids, with scalding sensation, gradual failure of strength. Any of the above symptoms signify kidney affection. His physician treats him for symptoms and calls it a disease, when in reality it is but a symptom of kidney trouble. He may be treated for rheumatic or neuralgic pains, heart affection, or any other disease to which he is most susceptible. Finally, the patient has pulling under the eyes, slight bloating of the ankles and legs. His physician informs him that it is but the accumulation of blood in his ankles for want of proper exercise. The bloat continues and reaches his body. Then he is informed he has dropsical troubles, and is tapped once or twice. He notices it is difficult to breathe owing to irregular action of the heart, and finally is informed that he has a slight attack of Bright's disease. At last, the patient suffocates, is smothered, and dies from dropsical trouble. Or perhaps the disease may not take the form of a dropsical tendency, and the patient dies from apoplexy, paralysis, pneumonia, or heart trouble. Or it may take the form of blood poisoning. In each form, the end is the same. And yet he and his friends were warned by the proprietors of the celebrated remedy known as Warner's Safe Cure, of the lurking dangers of a slight kidney affection: he did not heed the warning that a storm was approaching. He declined the proffered hospitality, and recklessly went forward into danger. He struggled manfully for a time, but his strength failed, he grew gradually weaker and he was lost to the world. Not in a blizzard, but from a terrible malady which is occurring in every community, and which is treated as a symptom instead of what it is—a mortal disease unless properly treated.

Ontario Items: Nearly $11,000 has been subscribed for the new St. Andrew's church at Perth. The oldest man in Canada, says the Perth Expositor, John Vaughan by name, died last week at Easton's Corners. No one seems to know just how old he was, but proof is said to have been made that he was at least 110. Large numbers of our farmers, says the Perth Expositor, are leaving for Manitoba by the Canadian Pacific railway colonist trains every Tuesday. Montague, Beckwith, Lanark, and Lanark townships have the Manitoba fever very badly. Archdeacon Bedford Jones, at Napanee, in his discourse on Sunday week, styled prohibition and total abstinence "quack remedies," and claimed that the grace of God should be relied upon, rather than the legislation of a parliament, to suppress the liquor traffic. The action of the trustees of the Methodist church, Bolingbroke, against the Baptist minister and Mr. Korry has been settled. The Methodists retain the church, the burying ground is to be used as a general burying ground, and each party pays their own costs. The South Lanark branch of the Dominion Alliance has issued an appeal to the electors in view of the coming election on the repeal of the Scott Act, setting forth that the repeal of the Scott Act means a return to license; that license is not only vicious in principle, but powerless as a remedy for the evils of intemperance; that those whose wills are weakened by a depraved appetite are entitled to the protection of a Christian state against that which leads them astray; that wherever the Scott Act has been fairly enforced, it has undoubtedly lessened the amount of drinking and all its attendant evils; and finally that the Scott Act has not had a fair trial in Lanark.

18890405: THE QUEBEC BRIDGE Another deputation is to wait today upon the Dominion Government to urge the immediate construction of a railway bridge across the St. Lawrence at Quebec. This work would, of course, in one way be of considerable importance to the Ancient Capital. The expenditure of the sum the bridge is expected to cost in its immediate neighborhood would give a much-needed temporary boom to its trade, and the facilities for reaching the city from the south shore would be permanently improved. But there is more than a Quebec view to take of this question. The country is asked to expend upon this scheme a sum estimated at the least at six million dollars, and certain, before the completion, to be largely enhanced. Are these advantages to the country such as would warrant the increase of the national debt by such a sum? Would the traffic presenting itself, at a reasonable toll, pay interest on the original cost and the charges of maintenance? Those are questions that have to be satisfactorily answered before Parliament can consent to vote such a heavy subvention. The Quebec people themselves have not shown their faith in their own claims; the company formed to undertake the work received subscriptions of only ten thousand dollars from the merchants of the city whose trade is presumed to warrant so vast an expenditure. That certainly is not an encouragement to the Dominion to invest in a structure the traffic of which may be estimated from the fact that up to the present it has never been sufficient to warrant the operation of an ordinary railway ferry. Two small steamers accommodate the freight and passenger traffic.

lic between the north and south shores of the St. Lawrence at Quebec. A memorial presented to the Government last year dwells on the importance of an unbroken connection from ocean to ocean over Canadian territory. But this connection already exists. At Montreal and at Lachute, bridges now built unite the Intercolonial system with the Western lines. Within a year, a bridge at Coteau will give a third available connection for an all-Canadian route from the Atlantic to the Pacific. There is no object in freight from the lower to the upper provinces, or vice versa, crossing the river at Quebec. Cars delivered by the Intercolonial to the Grand Trunk at Chaudière Junction are practically the same distance from Montreal and points in Ontario as they would be after crossing the river on the proposed bridge. Traffic from Montreal and Toronto to Halifax, or from Halifax to Montreal and Toronto, covers the bulk of the Intercolonial's through business. I would be actually disadvantaged by having to use the bridge. The tolls would be an unnecessary and serious burden, and the extra distance to be traversed would be a drawback. The coal and sugar traffic would not find the bridge route; it reaches its destination in Montreal much better and more conveniently by existing lines. The east-bound freight from the cities at Montreal and points west will follow the route taken by that coming from the lower province seaboard. No argument based upon the traffic requirements can justify the demand for so many millions from the country. These demands are amply met by existing lines. The traffic in coal, lumber, live stock, fish, grain, flour, and other foodstuffs that constitutes the growing bulk of the Intercolonial's business neither arises nor ends in Quebec. The men who handle this merchandise do not make their headquarters in the ancient city. They live east and west of it; they are among the consumers at either end of the railway system. They would not be benefited by the bridge. As for the local trade of the city, as has been said above, ferry steamers accommodate it, and the need for a car transfer boat has not yet become imperative. These are facts that the Government and Parliament should take into very serious consideration before pledging such enormous sums of public money to any scheme, let alone one of such doubtful public utility, even from a Quebec view; for it is not yet shown how a bridge for through traffic some six miles distant from that city will build up its importance or its trade.

ENGLAND'S FRIEND, KING JOHN

The reported death of King Johannes of Abyssinia recalls the remarkable part that Prince Kassai was called upon to play in one of England's great modern military enterprises. Some of our readers may remember the time when King Theodore was a daily subject of conversation on the streets and a frequent theme for comment, more or less to the point, in the press. At that time Abyssinia was one of the least known of countries, and the obstinate potentate who deeply resented a slight to his dignity as a sovereign as to defy the power of Great Britain was only known by name and by vague reports of his doings. His rise to supreme power was not, however, without features of romance, and though he closed his life under a cloud of defeat and ignominy, there was a stage in his career when his power and reputation made him not the least enviable of semi-barbarous rulers. He was of noble lineage, fairly well educated, and early began to show ability as a leader of men. Putting himself at the head of the organized opposition, he successively defeated all the troops sent against him and finally had himself crowned as Theodore III. In 1860, the British consul, Mr. Plowden, who was strongly attached to Theodore, was mortally wounded. The King took a terrible revenge on his murderers. Captain Cameron, the new consul, arrived at Massowah in 1862, and soon after reached Theodore's camp. In October of the same year, Consul Cameron was dispatched with a letter to Queen Victoria, which was handed to the officials of the foreign office in February 1863. For some reason, it was not answered. About August, 1863, Captain Cameron returned to Abyssinia, without the King's authority. At the same time, Theodore was chafing at the failure of the Queen to answer his letter. Doubly offended, therefore, he had Cameron, and Messrs. Stern and Rosenthal cast into prison. Intelligence of what had taken place reaching England, Mr. Hormuzd Rassam was dispatched with a letter to the King, but not for over a year did he receive any satisfaction. He was then invited to visit the King and treated with courtesy and hospitality, but a change occurred in Theodore's mind and the released prisoners were again thrust into confinement. About the same time, Mr. Flad was dispatched with a letter to the Queen asking for European workmen and machinery. For a time, the prisoners were well treated but latterly they suffered from both cold and hunger, as well as constant apprehension. Mr. Flad's return with a reply to Theodore's letter saying that the workmen and machinery would be sent as soon as the prisoners were set free produced no effect. In 1867, it was recognized that force would have to be used. Accordingly, an army was especially equipped for the service with Sir Robert Napier (now Lord Napier of Magdala) as commander. The story of the campaign has been often told. It has long been part of our military history. The landing took place on the 7th of January, 1868, the task to be accomplished being the transport of over 30,000 men over 400 miles of mountainous country to Theodore's fortress at Magdala. On the 11th of April, the storming of that stronghold took place and Theodore's dead body was found within. The success of the expedition was largely due to the timely aid of Prince Kassai of Tigré. Had he been hostile, instead of friendly, the issue might, indeed, have been sadly different. Before leaving the country, the English General showed his gratitude by a gift of ordnance, small arms, and ammunition, of which the happy receiver made such good use that he not only declared and maintained his independence but made himself Theodore's successor. In 1872 he was crowned King of Abyssinia at Axum. On the throne he never forgot that to England's opportune present he was largely indebted for his good fortune. England did not always reciprocate the barbarian's good will. His confidence in her friendship must sometimes have been severely tried. For years the Egyptians proved a thorn in his side, of late the Italians have given him constant anxiety on one hand and the fanatical Dervishes on the other. Whether England could have turned the opportunities opened up in 1868 to better account for the advancement of civilization in nominally Christian Abyssinia, it is needless to discuss. Practically she did nothing with her knowledge or with King John's friendship—agencies which might, if properly employed, have been used as levers for the moral elevation, as well as for the material and commercial development of all East Africa. Now the country is once more in a state of anarchy and rulers may arise who will only remember that England, while quick to avenge her slighted honor and injured citizens, is also quick to forget those who befriend her in the hour of need.

It was a very wet day in Ontario yesterday. The new states of Dakota are getting a baptism of fire. The Globe has found a new position on the Jesuits' bill. It is that Mr. Hurdler, being a Catholic, did right to pass it; but Sir John Macdonald, being a Protestant, did wrong to allow it. This makes things right for the Liberals both in Ontario and Quebec. The Pope in his letter to Cardinal Gibbons and the American Catholics seeks the sympathy of "those even who, though not in communion with us, are at least witnesses" of the Pontiff's loss of power. Standard is needed in Europe more than in Quebec. The Mail has published the portraits of all Toronto's detectives. They make the worst looking lot of countenances that has appeared in public since the Witness printed its pictures of Montreal's alibis. The average criminal would gladly go to prison to be out of their way. Lieutenant William Grant Stairs, who is doing such good service with Buller, is a Canadian, son of the former M.P. for Halifax, a graduate of '82 of the Kingston Military College, and a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. With such a beginning as he has made, it is safe to say that his country will hear more of him before his career is ended. 

Patagonia has a plague for every season. Cyclones sweep it in the summer; early frosts parch its harvests in the fall. In the winter, its blizzards overwhelm the unwary traveler. The spring wind and rain combine to ruin its farmers. The only thing its people can do is to move up into Canada out of the ruin while yet some of them are spared. The United States Treasury is doing presently profitable business by buying two million dollars worth of silver every month and coining it into two million eight hundred thousand silver "dollars." This is a thing that can only go on for a certain length of time. By and by a United States dollar will only purchase 75 cents worth of goods, and then the silver kings will be deposed. 

Fleeing from France to Belgium has been like stepping out of the frying pan into the fire for General Boulanger. He is in imminent danger of expulsion from his present refuge, and his friends at home are divided. A number of them call him a coward. This is the worst appellative that can be cast at a Frenchman. Ordinarily it would kill him politically; but Boulanger is as hard to kill as he is to define. The annual fight before the commissioner over the "Oxford" license has resulted, as usual, in the success of the saloon in the contest between the application and the opposition as to which could be the more earnest without actually breaking the law. It must be acknowledged that the saloon did not by any means come out ahead. The commissioners never had better ground for their action than this year. The exhibition of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colors, which took place in the spacious galleries in Piccadilly a few weeks ago, while up to the usual excellence, did not rise above it. The drawings were extremely numerous, there being 823. There were few that did not mark a respectable degree of attainment, but works of really striking merit were comparatively few, and the artists showed a tendency to repeat themselves. As a rule, the pictures lacked individuality and freshness. The Herald says Mr. Merivale returned from his mysterious mission on Tuesday and is now at Quebec. This story is meant for the marines. The idea of the Nationalist Premier going to the capital like an ordinary public man is too much. Where were the tinpot demonstrations; where, the brass band; where Mr. Pacaud? Why, Mr. Morin would have had a bigger reception if the Premier arrived in Quebec without the sycophants turning out. Next, we will hear that the seal coat is only plush. The Arab report that Rumley and Euan Boy are marching on Zanzibar with several thousand of a following is not out of keeping with the explorer's letter published the other day. Euan then was apparently in doubt as to where his duty lay, but it could not have been hard to persuade him that no profitable object was to be secured by remaining in Central Africa as the representative of a power which long ago abdicated its authority over the province he was sent to govern. So large a body as the united forces will necessarily move slowly, but it has a shorter distance to travel than that over which the news came, and, unless some serious mishap occurs, it will not be long till the world welcomes back the gallant governor and brave explorer whose conduct has given full warrant for bracketing their names with those two great Christian heroes of civilization in Africa, Gordon and Livingstone. An explanation was recently given in the Monitor du Home, of a rumor which, it appears, had been circulated in parts of the continent, to the effect that Queen Victoria and the Empress Dowager Frederick contemplated embracing Roman Catholicism. The story seems to have originated somewhat obscurely out of some conversations that passed at Her Majesty's tea table. The subject of Italy and the Vatican coming up, the Empress Frederick repeated some remarks of her late husband after his return, when Crown Prince, from a visit to Pope Leo XIII.

The Isle Emperor expressed the utmost respect for the personal character of His Holiness. The Empress Dowager said that, ever since, she had entertained a sentiment of veneration for the aged Pontiff. The Queen at once recalled that she shared those sentiments, but nothing was said either of joining the Church of Rome or of the struggle between the Vatican and Italy. The Monitor bases its version of the incident on a communication from London to the correspondent of AW.

1889-04-11: F. Alloway, of Winnipeg. Mrs. Alloway and another lady were in the room and all were chatting pleasantly together. Mr. Rata had been saying that he was feeling so well lately, and the conversation had drifted to other subjects, when he suddenly fell from his chair and died almost without a struggle. The alarm was given, and in a very short time four physicians were in attendance, but it was a case where skill could avail nothing. The deceased was born in the Niagara district, and was for some years a resident at St. Cuthbert’s, having been a resident of Ottawa for a great number of years and filled the mayor's chair. In 1881 he built up a large grocery business here and amassed great wealth. 

Two Men Drowned: St. John, N.H., April 10. Word has been received that on Thursday last a sleigh containing Pahlel Harris, John McDougall, and a friend named Lambe, of Caraquet, while proceeding up the Restigouche River to O'Leary's lumber camps, when at a place called Two Finks, about 23 miles above Mclupedin, the ice broke through and they were drowned.

EXPLORING IN A BLIZZARD: Lord Lonsdale Has a Narrow Escape From Death in the North. T., April 9. The fishing schooner Cumberland, Captain Elliott, which arrived here today after a stormy passage of thirty-four days from Kodiak Island, Alaska, brings news of Lord Lonsdale, who started upward of a year ago on a trip overland to the North Pole. Lord Lonsdale and a number of Eskimo and Indian guides reached Kodiak about the middle of February in a famished and exhausted condition. They came from an isolated mission near the mouth of the Kuskokwim River, which empties into Bristol Bay, and encountered many hardships and privations during the journey of months' duration across the Alaskan peninsula. The explorer, Lord Lonsdale, was severely injured a few days after leaving the mission. While in the lead of his party, he slipped and fell into a crevasse. His left shoulder was so bruised that the arm was rendered useless and his hip was all but dislocated, incapacitating him for travel on foot. He was placed on a sled, and in that condition transported to Kodiak. The great stretch of territory between the mission and the island was covered to the depth of several feet with light snow. The terrible blizzard that prevailed caught up the light particles in clouds, obfuscating all tracks and landmarks familiar to the guides and making drifts through which it was next to impossible to make a passage.

A Terrible Experience: On February 3, the party reached a lake almost in the center of the peninsula. A stop was made to rest the dogs, which were in a worse condition than the men. A blizzard set in and continued for four days, during which time Lord Lonsdale, the guides, dogs, and all were huddled together under a shelter made by standing the sled on end. When the storm ceased, Lord Lonsdale was found to be so ill from fatigue and lack of proper nourishment and medical treatment that it was feared he would not survive the journey. The guides broke up one of the sleds and built a fire, over which they cooked some food and boiled water, with which they bathed the injured parts and reduced the swelling. Lord Lonsdale improved somewhat, and the journey toward Kodiak was resumed.

One Hundred Below Zero: The latter half of the trip was even more perilous and trying than the beginning. The temperature for several days registered 100 below the freezing point, and blizzards were continuous. Several of the dogs succumbed to fatigue, others wandered off and were lost in the snow, and just before reaching Cook's Inlet, two of the Alaskan guides died and were buried in the snow. The party was in the last stages of fatigue when they reached Kodiak, and had not food and shelter been found there, Lord Lonsdale would have died. Captain Elliott offered the erratic nobleman passage in the Cumberland to New Westminster.

1889-04-20: GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK'S: A year ago, the expectation was aroused by Sir Charles Tupper, then Minister of Finance, of a reduction in the rate of interest paid on deposits in the Government savings banks. The Finance Minister had taken authority from Parliament to reduce the rate below 4 percent, and at the same time obtained power to issue a large loan in the London market, a portion of the proceeds of which it was hinted might be required to pay depositors in the Government savings banks who desired to withdraw their balances because of the lowering of the interest rate. Nothing, however, has yet been done in this direction, and there continues to be paid to the public creditor in Canada a rate of interest unduly high when compared with that paid to the public creditors abroad, or to the rates paid by the chartered banks. In round numbers, more than forty million dollars of the people's money is held in the Government banks, upon which interest to the amount of $1,600,000 is annually paid. Now the last loan placed in London is costing less than 3 percent, and it is fairly presumable that money can be borrowed there to pay off the depositors in the savings bank at as low a rate, in which case the operation would effect a saving in the annual interest charge upon the public revenues of the considerable sum of $360,000. So long as the Government was required to pay 4 percent interest for its British loans, the argument that Canadian creditors ought to receive as much for their money as those abroad had force, but that argument no longer applies. Tomorrow, by a stroke of the pen, almost, the Finance Minister can make a reduction in the interest charge of the public debt of at least $300,000, a sum sufficient to pay the interest on a capital charge of $9,000,000; or, to put it in another way, the Government could make a capital expenditure of $9,000,000 in enlarging the St. Lawrence canals without adding a single penny to the interest account by simply equalizing the rate paid on savings banks' deposits to that paid foreign creditors. The fear that a large withdrawal of deposits would follow upon a reduction in the rate of interest is probably unfounded. In the first place, the Government savings banks are patronized by a good many people because they afford absolute security; in the next place, a considerable proportion of the deposits are drawn from localities where no chartered banks exist and where, therefore, competition for the money does not prevail; and, lastly, the rate of interest paid by the chartered banks during the past two or three years has been lower than by the Government institutions. No doubt the depositors would clamor loudly against a reduction of one percent interest, but after all the depositors are a small minority of the whole people, and it is to the general interests, to the greatest good of the greatest number, that the Government should look. It is manifestly unfair that one hundred thousand depositors in the savings banks should annually draw in interest from the revenues from general taxation three or four hundred thousand dollars more than would be paid if the money were borrowed abroad. It is well to encourage habits of economy and thrift among the masses, to place within their reach safe and convenient receptacles for their surplus earnings, but these objects may be quite as effectively attained with a 3 percent as with a 4 percent rate of interest on deposits, the more especially since the chartered banks, less widely distributed and affording less advantages in some respects, pay the lower rate. 

Another reason often urged for reducing the interest on deposits in the savings banks is that the present rate diverts money from the chartered banks and therefore from the channels of legitimate trade. If, however, this argument is worth anything, it means that no competition with chartered banks ought to be permitted, and that not only the Government but the private savings banks ought to be abolished. It is, of course, presumable that a lowering of the Government interest to 3 percent would cause the transfer of some deposits to the chartered banks, and thereby increase the resources and loaning power of the latter, but the amount that would be exchanged would, we are convinced, be unimportant. The chartered banks today have abundant resources; their deposits have never before been so large as now, and they have continued to augment in spite of the payment of a lower rate of interest than in the Government banks. The strong argument to be pressed upon the Finance Minister for a reduction in the interest rate is that all the money the Government requires can be much more cheaply borrowed abroad, that the continuance of a 4 percent rate to depositors constitutes an unfair discrimination, and imposes an unnecessary charge upon the public revenues for the benefit of a favored class. 

The body of another murdered babe was found on the street yesterday. There will be another inquest today. That will end the chapter in crime. It always does in Montreal. It must have been the Wilneim's fodder famine maker that discovered in the Municipal Reports evidence that "the population of the Eastern Townships has decreased, not increased." Here is Dakota with another plague. Mice are so plentiful in the blizzard district that the rat market has gone up, and turns and tabbies are being shipped west in carloads and sold at $2 apiece. How thankful the Ontario exodusters this year must be that they disregarded the Grit papers' advice and made their new homes in Manitoba. Someone in the West has started a scare over the danger of smallpox or other disease developing on ocean steamships between the time they pass the Gros Islet quarantine station and the landing of their passengers at Montreal. Somebody wants a situation. Are healthy immigrants more exposed to infection during a tool sail up the river than during the same time spent in crowded immigrant rams? Mr. Mercler objects to the settlement of the Ontario boundary as proposed by the Dominion Government, though it is accepted by Mr. Mowat. The chief principle of Mr. Mercler’s politics is that the removal of any subject from the arena of dispute in which the Federal Government is likely to be a party to the proceedings is a thing to be steadfastly opposed. But the public is getting tired of a party that can only curse its opponents' propositions. The proposed settlement of the Ontario boundary, accepted by the federal and local Government, will give the province a seaboard of some hundred and fifty miles on Hudson's Bay, and add to it a knowledge territory, an irregular area having a southern base of about four hundred miles, the eastern and western boundaries converging till the Hudson's Bay coast is reached, where they are about one hundred and forty miles apart. The eastern limit is a straight line drawn due northward from the head of Lake Temiscamingue, which is probably the part that excites Mr. Mercler's opposition. There does not, however, seem any good ground for dissent. The territory is not agriculturally valuable so far as the greater part of it is known. It is not a timber region, and its mineral wealth is problematic. Poor or rich, however, it may as well belong to Ontario as to any other member of the federation. If Quebec wants more, the Dominion can throw in any extent of territory out of East Maine.

The Hon.

1889-07-01: B. Cutler, of Salt Lake, a banker of unlimited wealth. Bid odds were given on the Brooklyn Handicap, and, as Exile won, the firm paid out only $100, but took in thousands. The firm made big money on the Suburban, while Whitney and his partner stood to lose on Spokane in the American Derby, and rather than pay anything to the lucky bettor, concluded to jump the town. It is said that Whitney acted in a similar performance.

Here today, the 2:40 was trot won by Alice Withers, half-sister of Fanny Withers. The track was heavy, the best heat being made in 2:18. Billy The Rover won the pony race, and Gray Eagle the half-mile running heat. Blizzard was the winner in the military skirmishing race. 

A Curious Case in England: A curious question has arisen in English racing circles in connection with pony racing in the early part of the year. A racing filly, not up to Newmarket form, was let to an owner of dubious credentials for pony racing, in which she proved to be about the best in England, winning all she started for. Here comes in the extraordinary part of the business. She was entered in all those races as a three-year-old, though as a matter of fact she is only two years old, and the result is that the Pony Racing Club has warned the enthusiastic young owner off, and the mare is disqualified forever. The owner is now breathing legal fire, and he, in turn, is to be made a defendant by the breeder on the score of a breach of contract. It might be urged that there were not sufficient grounds for the warning off, insomuch as though it would undoubtedly be a crime to run a three-year-old in a two-year-old race and thus gain a great advantage, to run a two-year-old in a three-year-old race would be to gain the very reverse of an advantage. To this, however, it is replied, and with great force, "Yes, but if the filly had been kept until she was three years old, she would probably have grown, and thus, being over the stipulated standard in height, she would not have been qualified to compete."

18890913: Sept. 12. The storm in this vicinity is the worst known since the great blizzard. No lives have been lost, but the following properties have been destroyed: Mooch's house and pavilion, Dubow's cottage, Rodger's house and pavilion, Burke's two houses, and the houses of Dr. Hutchinson, Nedham, Babcock, and Lulu, and more may go if the storm continues. At Wildwood, the Wildwood hotel is a total loss, and part of the seawall is gone. Anglesea is not submerged and has thus far escaped with little damage. Sea Isle City, Ocean City, and Avalon are entirely cut off from communication, and the extent of the damage there can only be imagined. The storm this afternoon is still raging, with the wind blowing fifty miles an hour.

Sandy Hook: Rapidly Gaining Long Branch, September 12. The high tide of this morning threatened to topple several more summer cottages into the surging waves. The new inland cut through the Sandy Hook peninsula is being rapidly widened and deepened. The streets on the west side of Seabright are still under six feet of water. Railroad Tracks Washed Out.

18891023: "Local Provision: There was no important change in the local provision market to note, prices having continued steady all round. There continues to be a steady demand for pork in small lots on both local and country account, and the market was fairly active. The demand for lard was moderate, and a fair number of sales were effected at steady prices. Canadian cherry cut, per bbl $9.00; pork, western, per bbl $12.00; short cut, western, per bbl $10.00; hams, city first, per lb 12c; hams, canvassed, per lb 11c; lard, western, pails, per lb 10c; lard, Canadian, in pails, per lb 10c; tallow, commercial, per lb 6c. The demand for eggs continues good and the market was active and steady with a large volume of business being done. Buyers look to hold more freely and some large sales were made at 17c to 18c per dozen. The demand for game today was good, of which the offerings were fair, and the market was active with prices steady. Choice partridges sold at 45c to 50c, and culls down as low as 25c per brace. Butter: There is no change to note in the butter market. The demand is fair and there is a steady movement sufficient to keep stocks in order. Prices are maintained: creamery, late made 21c; choice 20c; medium to good 15c. Merchants 14c; 18c; 15c. Western, choice 18c; medium 14c. Cheese: "What will the morrow bring forth?" is still a question agitating the minds of operators, both of buyers and sellers. The former appear to be confident of better bargains later, while the latter hold to the stand they have adopted all along. A good many eyes are turned towards the country, and "how long are they going to hold out?" is a problem that is agitating a good many buyers' minds. That some have decided to come down from the stand they adopted, there is no doubt, but there is no pronounced intention as yet as far as can be learned. It must be understood, however, that this is not a sign of weakness to the market, which is a steady one. The difficulty has been that holders in the country have been asking away above what buyers consider figures for business, and the former are now giving signs that they realize the fact. The public continues unchanged at 52s and there was little to note on spot. Our special dispatch from Ingersoll says that there is no change and indicates that holders there continue independent, as there has been no business." 

Finest September 1903. All kinds of fine stock. The market remains steady. 

Commercial Hotel: Spot tin in London is cabled at £51, do three months at £51 12s 6d. Spot copper at £61 17s 6d, do, for delivery at £62 5s. Warrants at Glasgow are cabled at £41 8s. No. 3 Middlesborough iron is at £41 10s 6d, and Spanish £40. The president of one of the largest coal companies in Pennsylvania said today that there is a misapprehension as to the real state of the coal trade. There is but an unusual quantity of coal at the seaboard, and but little if any more than is generally kept there to respond to any demand. Here is the corrected text:

**Omergoncy:** It is true that there is a falling off in the production from last year of about 2,000,000 tons, but much of this will be made up during the winter months. The trouble is, people insist on comparing this year, which is a normal year in the coal trade, with last year, which, owing to a variety of causes, among them the March blizzard, was quite abnormal. All the coal producers are now mining their usual quantity of anthracite. The advent of cold weather will change the aspect of the market; consumers will at once buy, and the stock at the seaboard and stored at the mines will very soon be used up. 

The Philadelphia Record, discussing the iron market, says: "A more or less feverish condition exists in the iron trade east and west because of the apprehended scarcity of crude material before buyers have fully covered their forward requirements. In western markets, speculative purchases of over 100,000 tons of pig iron have been made within a few days, but in eastern and local markets there is nothing beyond a quiet, steady movement. Heavy transactions have been closed this week in western Pennsylvania and in northern Illinois for HcHse-mefplg, foundry, and forge, and rumors of a further advance are rife. The lake ore demand is extraordinary. Sales at Cleveland for the season foot up over 6,000,000 tons, and the output for the season will probably reach 7,300,000 tons. The demand for merchant steel is at a maximum limit. Steel rails are quoted at $32 to $33. Additional sales reported this week, 75,000 tons. Western quotations have advanced to $34. Mills are better supplied with business than they have been for some years, and by all present indications, a further advance will take place."

**Montreal, October 22:** Notwithstanding the fine weather and the improved condition of the roads, the gathering of buyers at Bonsecours market this morning was small; consequently, the tone of the market was quiet and the volume of business transacted was small compared with last Friday's market. The attendance of farmers was larger and the supply of grain offered was heavy. The demand was good and an active business was done, sales of round lots of oats being made at 75c per bag. The feeling was steady and prices were unchanged. There was a good supply of vegetables offered for which the demand was limited, and sales were slow in consequence, and up to a late hour considerable stock was left unsold. Lettuce was scarce and prices advanced to $1.00 per dozen. There was also a stronger feeling in cauliflowers and prices were higher at 30 to 10c each. There was no important change in fruit. The demand was quiet and sales were slow notwithstanding the large assortment offered for this season of the year. Dairy produce was plentiful for which the demand was fair at steady prices. There was a good supply of poultry and game offered, but the demand was slow and the volume of business accomplished was small at steady prices. The fish market was quiet as usual on Tuesday on account of the slow demand and values were unchanged.

**The Horse Market:**
Montreal, October 22: There has been a good inquiry from American buyers for a general-purpose class of horses, but owing to the small supply offering and the continued light receipts for this season of the year, buyers have not been able to fill their wants; consequently, the tone of the market has been quiet and the volume of business transacted small. However, as advices of several carloads to arrive have been received, the indications are that a more active trade will be done this week, and dealers generally are looking for a steady improvement in the market from this out. At the Montreal Horse Exchange, at Point St. Charles, business has been quiet and few sales have been effected. The receipts by the Grand Trunk and from the city at these stables for the week ending October 10 were 137 head; left over from previous work, 28 total, 165 shipped, 111; left for city, 54; on hand for sale, 20.

Mr. Duggan received by the steamship Aluddo 12 horses consigned to J.

1889-10-29: & R McLEA, 8 Common Street after spending for Winters South, was cured by "Scott's Emulsion," 141 Centre St., New York, June 16th, 1891. The winter after the great fire in Chicago I contracted bronchial affection and since then have been obliged to spend nearly every winter south. Last November I was advised to try Scott's Emulsion of Cod Liver Oil with Hypophosphites and to my surprise was relieved at once, and by continuing its use for three months was entirely cured, gained flesh and strength and was able to stand even the blizzard and attend to business every day.

November 1: About 1 o'clock this morning the United States revenue cutter Ewing arrived in the harbor conveying the brig Alice, which arrived in the Capes yesterday with part of the Navassa rioters. The Romance, with the remaining rioters, was left down the bay in charge of the revenue cutter, Lot M. Morrill. The prisoners captured in the Alice were lodged in the city jail. examination of those on board the Alice Important facts were elicited. It was shown by some of the negroes that a conspiracy to murder the whites was planned some days before the 15th of September. The attack commenced in conformity to the plans by striking in the head Charles W. Ruby, the superintendent of the mines. He was left for dead. The crowd then proceeded to the quarters of the superintendent and before night, and after the whites had delivered up all their arms, men were murdered in cold blood. Mr. Foster was disemboweled. District Attorney Hayes, who has been since the 17th inst. on the Ewing, off Lewes, considers the Government has a strong case against a dozen or more of the ringleaders. The cases will be pressed for trial at once. There were 124 persons brought up by the brigs Alice and Romance, all of whom are held either as prisoners or witnesses. 

Mexican Mutiny  
Civok, Mexico, November 1. A mutiny occurred among the train escort on an up train from Vera Cruz, Tuesday evening. A corporal and four privates attacked their superior officers, severely wounding the lieutenant and killing a sergeant. The object of the mutineers seemed to have been to stop the train and make their escape. They first attacked the sergeant, and in the struggle, this officer was run through by a bayonet which pierced his left lung and stood out several inches beyond his back. The lieutenant attempted to engage the mutineers with his sword and wounded two of them. The mutineers then climbed over the tender to the engine for the purpose of making the engineer stop the train. The engineer was an American, and he and his foreman were armed. They prepared to resist the attacking party when the mutineers jumped from the train. One was cut in two and killed, and the others were injured but escaped. The greatest alarm prevailed among the passengers and several women fainted.

Washington, November 1. The report of General O. O. Howard, commanding the division of the Atlantic, calls attention to the lack of armaments of nearly all sea coast stations. He calls attention to an "Americanite," the invention of a young Russian, formerly a botanist of the Point Barrow expedition, which is the safest and best explosive. The General knows of it. It has been adopted by the Standard Oil Company for "shirting" its wells. "With such a powerful agent," the General says, "the problem of coast defense is solved almost into one of range, and our great seaboard cities can be made comparatively safe without excessive expenditure." Gen. Howard recommends that the present rifle for infantry and cavalry be exchanged for a magazine gun. 

First Blizzard of the Season  
Omaha, Neb., November 1. Heavy snow has been falling here since early this morning. The storm played havoc with the railway telegraph lines and the overland trains generally. The fall of snow is about six inches, as reported from several towns in Western Nebraska, while in Wyoming a blizzard prevails, and it is feared that a blockade will compel the suspension of trains. Telegraph wires on the Burlington are broken at several points west of Omaha. Trains on the Elk Horn branch were delayed more or less owing to the snow. Snow is reported to have fallen as far west as Valentine, where the mercury is rapidly falling and a cold wave prevails.

A Great Land Transaction  
Jacksonville, Fla., November 1. One of the largest transactions in land ever consummated in the South has recently been perfected.

Of this amount $500,000 will represent the New York Central, $100,000 the West Shore, $10,000 the Wagner Palace Car Company, and the balance the horse car interests in the city controlled by the New York Central.

Arthur's Friends in the Majority  
Denver, Col., November 1. At the meeting of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers yesterday, the report of the special committee on federation, to whom had been referred the resolutions adopted by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, was received.

The convention is nearly equally divided, the majority siding with Arthur.

A Professional Accountant at Work  
St. Louis, November 1.

What the Hawaiians Want  
Honolulu, November 2. F. B. Finker, a member of King Kalakaua's military staff, was here yesterday and authoritatively denied the stories that the Hawaiian Islands want to be annexed to this country.

1889-11-04: W. F. Harpo, treasurer of the Chicago and Pacific Elevator Company, said today: The cablegram was probably well founded. Negotiations for the transfer of the Chicago Elevator property to the English syndicate are in progress. The Keimont has information that the elevators belonging to Munder, Wheeler & Co. have been sold for $2,500,000 to the English syndicate. The Munder, Wheeler system is the largest in the city, having a capacity of 6,500,000 bushels. The amount paid is said to be $2,250,000.

Murderous Work of Revolutionists  
San Francisco, Cal., November 2. Advices from Guatemala regarding the revolution there state that Col. Ruana, who led the insurrection, and his two brothers, were shot four days after the trouble commenced, by order of President Barrios. The insurrectionists numbered 200, and their object seemed to be to turn the capital over to Ruana. Several of them were shot by order of the President. One of Col. Ruana's principal supporters, Reina Barrios, a relative of ex-President Barrios, and Manuel Hovia, formerly minister of finance and public instruction, are now in prison awaiting trial. Affairs are now quiet.

The Blizzard's Terrible Work  
Denver, Col., November 2. The snowstorm which has been raging for 48 hours has abated. The storm was the worst that has been experienced. All trains are delayed and telegraph communication with all eastern portions is destroyed. Three hundred miles east of here, over 15 miles of telegraph lines have been completely wrecked, while in Colorado the damage to fruit and shade trees is considerable. Reports from the south say the storm has drifted thousands of cattle and sheep off their ranges into the southeast, and that hundreds of the weak animals have perished in the blizzard.

Illinois and Missouri Shaken  
St. Louis, November 2. A perceptible shock of earthquake was felt in this city at 1:53 a.m. It shook tall buildings and frightened the inmates of many. It came apparently from a little north of east and lasted two seconds. 

Cairo, Ill., November 2. A heavy shock of earthquake, accompanied by a low report, was felt here at 11:30 this morning. It was about one minute in duration, the direction being from southwest to northeast. No damage is reported.

Jacksonville, Ill., November 2. The earthquake shock was felt here. It lasted several seconds and shook houses.

In Uncle Sam's Courts  
Baltimore, November 2. In the United States court today E. J. Waring, counsel for Henry Jones, charged with being one of the ringleaders of the Navassa Island rioters, obtained a writ of habeas corpus, returnable next Wednesday. This action is taken to test the constitutionality of the law which gives to the United States authority over Navassa Island. The latest reports from the West Indies indicate that the newly adopted constitution of Haiti declares that the black republic has jurisdiction over Navassa Island and the action of counsel Waring is to determine the continuance of jurisdiction.

General Grant's Remains  
New York, November 3. George V. Chichils says the body of General Grant will probably be removed from its present resting place in New York to West Point or Arlington Cemetery. Several years before his death, General Grant said his military superior, Winfield Scott, was buried at West Point and he would like to lie there. Influential Grand Army men have asked that the body be moved to Arlington, and special arrangements have been made to allow Mrs. Grant to be buried at the same place. United States army officers seem to prefer West Point.

Anthracite Prices Advanced  
Philadelphia, November 3. The anthracite coal shippers in the Schuylkill region have advanced the prices for furnace, lump, and steamboat sizes 15 cents per ton to $1 at the mines. The coal shippers from the Lehigh region will also advance the price of those sizes 10 cents per ton tomorrow, when the Lehigh Valley Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey will increase the rate of tolls 5 cents per ton on furnace sizes. These advances are due to improvements in the iron. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

Jacob Ilise, consul-general of Guatemala at New York, yesterday received the following telegram from the Minister of Foreign Affairs: "The rumors that circulate in the press of your city as to a revolution in Guatemala and the other Central American states are entirely false and of malicious origin, and should be contradicted.

1889-11-05: OVERCOME BY A BLIZZARD. Ten idle deaths of cowboys in a New Mexico snowstorm. C. Head, with several cowboys, camped near Sierra Grande with 1,000 beef cattle, which they were holding for the purpose of loading in cars. At four o'clock Friday morning, a blizzard from the northwest struck the herd, driving the cattle toward Panhandle, Texas, the cowboys being unable to hold the crew. The snow was so blinding that it was impossible to see fifty feet ahead. Miller called his men together, and they started to follow the herd and made an attempt to keep them bunched. The men became separated Friday night; one of them wandered into Head's home, almost half dead from cold and hunger. He told his story, and a rescuing party was immediately sent out. Saturday noon the frozen bodies of Henry Miller, Joe Martin, and Charles Jolly were found on the open plains not far from Folsom. The other men found their way to camp before being overcome with cold. 

A Watertown Girl Returned. New York, November 4. Willis M.

The winter after the great fire in Chicago, I contracted bronchial affections and since then have been obliged to spend nearly every winter south. Last November I was advised to try Scott's Emulsion of Cod Liver Oil with Hypophosphites, and to my surprise was relieved at once; and by continuing its use three months was entirely cured, gained flesh and strength, and was able to stand even the blizzard and attend to business every day.

1889-11-09: THIS TOWNSHIP'S CAPITAL. A wire for the Canadian Pacific. From our own correspondent. Sherbrooke, P.Q., November 8. Some local contractors are sending in to the Canadian Pacific offices in Montreal, tenders for the construction of the new railway station which that company has recently announced their intention of erecting here. It is to be a handsome building of brick, some 100 feet long by 40 wide, is to be fitted with all modern improvements and to cost in the neighborhood of $10,000. Not long ago the Grand Trunk management announced the immediate construction of a handsome station upon the site of the present one, to cost something well up in the thousands. The Canadian Pacific, of course, are bound to see there, at least as far as announcements go, and the question as to whether both projects will not end in smoke is just now agitating the public mind. Lieutenant-Colonel Mattice, brigade major of this military district, visited the Bishop's College school yesterday for the purpose of inspecting the arms and accoutrements at present on hand, and also with a view of fixing what steps could be taken towards a reorganization of the cadet corps which formerly flourished in the school.

Death in New Mexico. Nonsileirm, Dayton, New Mexico, November 8. Unless the snowstorm which has been raging for eight days comes to an end soon, next summer will show a country covered with the dead bodies of animals. The depth of snow is now not less than 26 inches on a level, and in many places it has drifted seven feet high. When the storm struck this section, seven large herds of cattle, numbering from 500 to 2,000 each, were being held near this place awaiting shipment to eastern markets. The rain of a week ago was followed Thursday morning by blizzards of snow and sleet which sent the herds in a southerly direction. In vain did the half-frozen cowboys try to check the march of the cattle, but on they went through the merciless storm until, finding it utterly impossible to hold the cattle, the cowboys rode aside and allowed them to pass, and when nearly dead rode their exhausted horses into canyons or partially sheltered places, where they passed many hours without food or fire. Five cowboys and two Mexican sheep herders are known to have been frozen to death. It is estimated that 20,000 sheep have perished in this part of the territory. The hay supply is nearly exhausted and $100 per ton is offered by stockmen. At Texline, nine miles below Clayton, two passenger trains have been snowbound for a week. Provisions are running out and the passengers are compelled to venture into the storm and kill cattle, the quarters of which are taken into the cars and roasted for food. It is thought the snowplow will reach the stranded trains today and release them. 

Pecos, Col., November 8. Railroad men report more trouble on the Divide today. The wind is blowing a perfect hurricane and cuts are filled with snow. All trains are blocked again, and the Fort Worth travel has stopped altogether. The situation there is much worse, as another great snowstorm is raging evidently in the Ballon Mountains.

1889-11-11: VICTIMS OF THE BLIZZARD. Terrible experiences of cowboys on Colorado's plains. MORE JOHNSTOWN FLOODS. Fatal Boiler Explosion. Rescued from a burning train. Grand Trunk Eastbound Freight Train. Trinidad, Col., November 10. The bodies of John Martin and Henry Miller, cowboys, frozen to death near Sierra Grande in last week's blizzard, have been brought to Folsom for burial. Four other men belonging to the same party are missing, and it is feared they are dead. It is reported that at least twenty men are missing from this range, and it is feared many will never be found. Jolly and Wise, who escaped badly frozen, tell a heartrending story of suffering. When the blizzard struck them Wednesday night of last week, they were holding a herd of 3,500 cattle, finding refuge in a snowdrift. The wind became a hurricane before morning, and when Martin and Jolly went on the last guard, about 3 a.m., the storm was so blinding they could not hold the herd. Jolly started to the camp for help. In the meantime, Miller and Wise had left the camp to assist in holding the cattle. Jolly could not find the camp, and Miller and Wise could not find the herd. All three were drawn together by shouting, and they wandered around until daylight, when they found Martin. The cold was so bitter that the men entered a ravine, and after fastening the horses, took the saddle blankets and buried themselves in a snowdrift. Frozen to Death. This was at three in the afternoon. It was only by the greatest efforts that Jolly and Wise succeeded in keeping awake. They were slightly apart from Martin and Miller and had difficulty in talking to each other. The snow piled up on them to such weight that they were forced to seek another drift. About 4 o'clock Friday morning, Miller called Jolly and Wise and told them they had all better go. When they crawled out, they searched in the drift for Miller and Martin. The latter only could be found, and he was dead. They took the horses and started leading them. They found Miller on his knees, his horse standing in front of him as though trying to protect him from the cold. He was asked to get up and go with them, but he was unable to rise and was assisted to his feet, but could not walk. Jolly started to get assistance while Wise remained with their dying companion. Both of Wise's hands were frozen, and he was helpless and was fast becoming insensible when the Mexican sheep herder found him and took him to a ranch a few miles distant. The men returned and found Miller lifeless. 

The Storm Elsewhere. Kansas City, November 9. A fierce snowstorm raged yesterday in southern and western Kansas. Snow, hail, and sleet fell so thick and was driven so fiercely by the wind that in many places people did not dare to venture out of doors. Trains are somewhat delayed.

P. Frye, chairman of the Pacific Railway Investigating Committee, which has just completed an examination of nearly 10,000 miles of Pacific roads, says the committee is now convinced that the roads can eventually pay their debts to the Government in full. That the management of the roads does not contemplate...

This corrected version maintains the original meaning and formatting while addressing OCR errors. Here is the corrected text:

Contemplate a surrender of the roads is shown by the fact that expensive improvements are going on everywhere. The senator says the Central Pacific is not profitable because it has to pay a very high price for coal. The road nowhere touches a coal field. It cannot get a bushel of coal that does not come from the east, and much of it is from Australia and New Zealand. On an average, it costs the road between $7 and $9 a ton, and last year 600,000 tons were used. Eastern roads pay about $1. 

Minneapolis, Pa., November 15. It is authoritatively announced that Miss Kathy Drexel will not remain in the Order of Mercy. She is merely making her novitiate in that order so that she may become a nun and found a new order. The sisterhood she will establish, it is said, will be distinctively American, and will have for its object missionary and charitable work among the Indians. Miss Drexel will build a house for the proposed order somewhere in the State of Omaha and will endow it handsomely. She will obtain recruits from the various orders to assist her in her work and will establish a novitiate for new members. The members of the new order will be expected to do all kinds of domestic work in addition to educating Indians.

The Blizzard in the Monument, Clayton, N.M., November 15. Don Luis Baca, a prominent sheep dealer of Pico Creek, speaking of the late blizzard in that region, says five Mexican sheep herders perished in his neighborhood, the bodies of four having been found. The snow completely covers the ground from Clayton to the Canadian River, a distance of 125 miles. Many Mexican families are in a destitute condition. Owing to the heavy snow, they are unable to leave their places to get food. Mr. Baca says other bodies will be recovered when the snow melts, as several men are missing.

Children Burned to Death, Damariscotta, Me., November 15. The four-year-old son and Kitty, the two-year-old daughter, of R. H.

The third child, still younger, saw the suffering of the others and went out, bringing the mother in, but relief came too late.

Freedom of Speech in Mexico City or Mexico, November 15. The sermon of Archbishop Ryan of Philadelphia, at Baltimore on Sunday, has caused a great sensation here because of the Archbishop's support of the rights of Catholic writers to criticize the faults of priests, while here Archbishop Labastide has excommunicated a number of persons for such criticisms, and charges have been brought against him in Rome for so doing.

1889-11-19: WEST LAMBTON. The West Lambton election has resulted in a success for Mr. Mowat's Government. Mr. Mackenzie, the Liberal candidate, having been elected by a plurality of 37 over Mr. Fleck, the Conservative representative, or about 100 more than Mr. Pardee obtained in 1886. The figures are not quite complete, but can only be slightly changed. The vote was a heavy one for a bye-election, exceeding that of the contest in 1886 by more than a hundred. The largest interest, perhaps, centered in the candidacy of Mr. McCrae, the third-party candidate, who received the endorsement of the Equal Rights Association and of the Prohibitionists. The measure of his support will hardly be satisfactory to either of those organizations. Any strong independent candidate could have done at least nearly as well. The Conservatives, who, so far as provincial affairs are concerned, have least to blame themselves for such an Equal Rights standpoint, suffered most from the Equal Rights candidate, their loss of votes compared with the last election being about 300, against about 210 taken from the Liberal total. This would indicate that the Liberals are considerably less inclined to disregard their party affiliations when invited to take up the banner of "truth and righteousness" than are the Conservatives. Perhaps they know why.

The fairs of the late season have had throughout the country an unprecedented success. The interest in them was enhanced rather than diminished by apparently rival attractions in nearly all the provinces, which, though they did not all happen simultaneously, were nevertheless of a character to compete with them in drawing persons who take only one holiday in the year. The fairs, however, showed that the variety of entertainment furnished only served to whet the public appetite for more and more. Certainly the attendance at the local as well as the more central fairs was extremely large, and Canada has reason to congratulate herself on the enterprise and enlightened interest in her progress thus manifested.

There has been just one noteworthy exception to this manifold ground for felicitation—the absence of any effort on Montreal's part to hold an industrial exhibition. We are glad that the question has been raised, and hope that hereafter Montreal will not be the only defaulter among the important cities and towns of the Dominion. No place in Canada has better advantages in the way of inter-communication, by land and water, of industrial activity, economic life and, when once established, of generous public spirit. 

What is to be done is the taint of elitism or the pollution to unfold the discussion of the assignment of functions. This is a subject in which party, creed, or race, as such, has no concern, and any attempt to introduce such elements of discord into the discussion or arrangement for it should be promptly frowned upon.

Not much anxiety need be felt for the Champ de Mars in connection with the reported intention of the Provincial Government to proceed against the Federal authorities to obtain possession of the ground. When the other real property of the Jesuits' estates was handed over to the colony, the Champ de Mars was retained by the Imperial Government for military purposes. It was held as ordinance land up to the time of the departure of the British troops and then handed over to the Canadian military authorities to be used for the same purposes. It is to be held now, and it would seem that the only power that can dispose of it is the Federal Government. Mr. Mercier never set up a legal claim on behalf of the Jesuits to their other estates, and the Federal Parliament, after what has happened within the past six months, will surely not recognize one of conscience in this matter. Appeal to the courts can only be made on legal grounds, and the most ardent friends of the Jesuits have not set up any such, nor does the Quebec Jesuits' Estates Act establish any.

Altogether apart from its controversial value, the collection of documents touching the Roman question, which, according to the Città Caldera, the Vatican signifies its intention of publishing, would be of the utmost historic interest. The manuscripts in question are now in the archives of the Vatican. They include diplomatic notes, letters from sovereigns and ministers, confidential communications, etc., covering the period in the pontificate of Pius IX from the first outbreak of the revolution till the military aspirations had found their goal in the occupation of Rome. The object of the Curia in giving those documents to the light would be to show that the movement from first to last was a conspiracy to despoil the Sovereign Pontiff of his morally inalienable possessions. The Italian Government, doubtless, has documents bearing on the same questions and succession of events.

At the solemn requiem for the repose of Kiel's soul held in Montreal in 1889, and attended by Mr. Mercier and some thousands of Nationalists, the contribution for the family of the dead rebel averaged less than two cents for each person present. The champagne bill at the little blowout with which Mr. Mercier celebrated the third anniversary of the execution on Balima must have far exceeded the sum total of the faithful's charity then Nationalism was young. Things have changed for the better with the Quebec Premier.

The chief justiceship of the Superior Court of the province has been rendered vacant by the resignation of Sir Andrew Stuart. Public opinion with one accord points to Mr. Justice Johnson as the rightful successor to the honor. He is the senior justice for this district and one of the ablest occupants of the bench in the province. It would be difficult to adduce stronger claims than his for the position, and the Government would, we are convinced, be doing both a wise and a popular thing by making the promotion.

Has Mr. Mercier's jury commissioner, Mr. Cloman, fallen into a Manitoba muskeg, been swept away in a blizzard, or is he waiting for some ill-disposed Norwester to commit a felony so that he may get a real Western jury to investigate? He has not been heard of since he undertook to convince Liberal Statesman Martin that it was wrong to do on the prairies what the Liberal Statesman Mercier does on the St. Lawrence. This suspense is becoming painful.

The statues of Guzman Blanco, thrown down by the Venezuelan mobs on Friday, were erected by that politician himself when he was dictator of the republic. From his comfortable quarters in the French capital, he can regard the incident with considerable equanimity. It is only his pride that suffers. Had he been at home it would likely have been his neck.

The English registrar of bankruptcy in his last report remarks upon the frequency with which the debtors admitted that their chief losses had been due to speculations which had nothing to do with their regular business. The grocer who thinks he can manipulate the world's grain market is not a product of this continent alone by any means. The proceedings in the Court of Queen's Bench yesterday recall the fact that the M.I.R. is fastened to Mr. Mc. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

Slmno's name by a very slender tie those days. It would be awkward indeed if the ex-"Lad" had to be prefixed to this title as well as to the "Hon." and the "Aid" the distinguished gentleman liked to lengthen his cognomen with. In referring to the Klmouski local election yesterday, it was stated that Mr. Tessier, the Liberal candidate, had been unseated by the courts. This was an error, unintentionally made. The present is Mr. Tessier's first candidature for legislative honors, so that he could not have been before the courts in the connection indicated. The gentlemen applying for incorporation as the Montreal Exhibition Company ask for the right to hold exhibitions of "any and every variety of thing and being found in the animal and vegetable kingdom." Not much that is worth looking at can escape such a broad net as this. In spite of that resolution of the Montreal Finance Committee, New York is going on collecting funds for the Columbus exhibition of 1902. New York does not seem to appreciate the force of Montreal's views in this matter as well as Chicago. Mount must go, but he is taking his time about it.

And Prospects In the States. Washington, November 27. The following has been issued by the Signal Office: Special Bulletin. A general storm now prevails over the country east of the Mississippi with gales on the lakes, and a cold wave advancing from the Northwest, which will cover the Ohio Valley tonight and Thursday. The rain will turn to snow in Western New York, Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana tonight and Thursday, with decided prospects of interruption to telegraphic communication in those sections, and interference with railway travel. These conditions will probably move eastward Thursday with possibly increasing severity. Another Eastern Disturbance Impending. Lieutenant Thompson, the director of the Signal Service Bureau, said tonight that the weather map resembled more closely than he has ever known before the conditions that existed on the night preceding the great blizzard a year ago last March. Out in Dakota, the thermometer is already down to 11 degrees zero, and he says it may possibly go down to 2. The rainstorm in this locality will stop the cold wave for a time, but afterwards the people will have to look out. He thinks there will be little snow as far south as Washington.

18891130: W Dwyer, a stock raiser of Colfax, N.M., states that thirty Mexican shepherds and five American cowboys lost their lives in the blizzard which raged in his section during the first fifteen days of November. 

Havoc to Quebec's Electric Wire. (From our own correspondent) Quebec, November 29. The Quebec & Levis Electric Light Company are perhaps the heaviest sufferers from yesterday's storm. Yesterday afternoon, the lofty transmission towers recently erected on Dorchester Bridge for carrying the electric light wires into the city were blown over into the River St. Charles on the upper side of the bridge. With them were blown down all the poles of the Electric Light Company from the bridge to Hedlryville. The loss to the company will be very large. These towers were supposed to be exceedingly firm and strongly built. They were 110 feet in height. The city was in darkness last night and must remain so tonight also. The manager, on hearing the news of the accident, notified the electrician at the Falls and instructed him not to turn on any of the dynamo. One hundred men in two gangs of fifty each were set to work to repair the damage, and though it will be impossible to have any of them in working order for tonight, it is hoped the light will be turned on again after another day or two. 

A Train Wrecker Sentenced. St. Thomas, Ont., November 27. Henry Weaver, who wrecked the Michigan Central train at Stevensville, pleaded guilty this morning and was sentenced to seven years in the Kingston penitentiary. 

To be Consul at Hamilton. Hamilton, November 27. President H. then today appointed William Monsghetti, of Ohio, to be consul at Hamilton, Ont. Mr. Monsghetti was appointed commercial agent at Chatham, Ont., last June. 

Mawmill Fire. WAi ilt issrut, Ont., November 27. At 10 o'clock tonight, fire was discovered in Wm Patterson's sawmill. It spread very rapidly and is still burning. The fire will be confined to the mill, the wind is blowing in a favorable direction. The loss will be about $10,000, partly covered by insurance. 

That tired, languid feeling, dull head, really disagreeable. Take two of Carter's Little Liver Pills before meals and you will find relief. They never fail to do good.

Bronchitis Cured. After spending one winter south, I was cured by Scott's Emulsion. 50 Cent St., New York, December 31, 1901. The winter after the great fire in Chicago, I contracted bronchial affections and since then have been obliged to spend nearly every winter south. Last November I was advised to try Scott's Emulsion of Cod Liver Oil with Hypophosphites and to my surprise was relieved at once, and by continuing its use three months was entirely cured, gained flesh and strength, and was able to stand even the blizzard and the cold.

18891221: C Colby, M.P., President of the Privy Council. Mrs. Colby, who was descended from the Hollidays, an old and honored Connecticut family, was among the oldest residents of Blainsford County. Her husband, Dr. Colby, who died in 1863, came to Blainsford in 1843, after having served as surgeon of volunteers in the troubles of 1837, and soon became known as an able and public-spirited citizen as well as a skillful physician. Mrs. Colby survived him for twenty-five years as his fitting helpmeet and lived to see her son win even greater honors than had been accorded to her husband. She has died at a ripe old age, esteemed as much for her social qualities as for the public services of her family. 

The Cabinet Government has taken a step that will have an important influence on the movement for the abolition of exemptions from taxation in that province, and possibly elsewhere as well. If the views of the municipal councils, which have been asked for throughout the province, are generally against exemptions, legislation will no doubt be had in conformity therewith; if opinion is fairly even, it is possible a solution may be had by leaving the question of exemption or no exemption to the municipalities. There is, indeed, something to be said for this on general principles. It is the municipalities which are directly interested. It is they who provide and pay for the services which the provincial laws say certain institutions shall enjoy for nothing, and it is reasonable that with them shall be left the decision. 

After all, L'Electeur's reading of the Globe cut of the Liberal-Nationalist party is something of a compliment to the Toronto organ. It implies a belief on the part of L'Electeur that its contemporary's views are the result of conviction and that what it says is really of importance. Not many who watch the Globe are willing to admit this. And then L'Electeur might have waited a little. The Globe is flopping around a great deal these days and is just as likely to flop over to L'Electeur's views as anywhere else. The unseasonable weather is nowhere more seriously felt than in the coal region. The twenty-five thousand Schuylkill miners now threatened with reduced wages and loss of work would bless a blizzard if it would bring a long spell of zero weather and reduce the consumers' coal piles throughout the continent. 

The Wilkes-Barre persists in saying that the Kingston result was satisfactory to the Equal Rights people; but there is a hysterical jerkiness about its sentences that looks as if there was a sore heart behind the brave front.

18891225: ITS RAVAGES IN EUROPE. The Influenza Reaches Many American Cities. 

From our correspondent, December 24. The influenza epidemic reigns and rages. The conference of lawyers which was to have convened yesterday did not do so because the majority of the speakers were ill. Reports from Berlin are that there is no abatement of the evil there. In Brunswick, it has assumed a malignant type, and there have been many deaths. At Stuttgart, it is increasing. Tramways have tested operations because the employees are all ill. Mayence has been very severely visited. At Munich, the cases increase and the transaction of business is interfered with. Theatres announced that the programmes of the plays are not to be depended upon as the illness of the actors may make it necessary to change names at any moment or even to change the piece. At Antwerp, the gloom is increasing, but it is diminishing among the garrison and the people at Amsterdam. It has appeared at Dordrecht among the soldiers and sailors and in the factories. It is very serious in the barracks at Brussels and half the carbineers and grenadiers of the Corps des Guides are ill. 

A physician named Dr. H. Dunmflchino, a prominent physician, is dead. He succumbed to an attack of influenza, complicated with an old affection of the lungs. Four other deaths have thus far been traced to the influenza epidemic, three at the military school of St. Cyr, and one at the Royal Technical Institute. 

London, December 24. Among the victims of the influenza epidemic are Count Von Taff, the Austrian Prime Minister, Archduke William of Austria, and Princess Stephanie, widow of the late Crown Prince Rudolf. The queen of Sweden has also been attacked. The disease is spreading rapidly in Western Europe. 

Vienna, December 24. A frequent sequel to cases of influenza here is an attack of inflammation of the lungs. A number of persons in the hospitals who had been suffering from the influenza were stricken with inflammation of the lungs, and several of them have died. Influenza has appeared in a Jesuit school at Fulksburg, the pupils of which are the children of conservative aristocrats. Sixty-eight of the scholars are ill. 

Pittsburgh, December 24. The influenza has its grip upon Pittsburgh, and it is estimated that there are many hundreds of cases throughout the city. Pittsburgh long ago established a reputation for what is known as the "Pittsburgh grip," a cold in the head peculiar to this town of smoke and damp atmosphere. The influenza thus far seems to be an exaggeration of this grip. Businessmen, clerks, letter carriers, and school children appear particularly to be affected, and a tour of the big stores disclosed that many fair shoppers were suffering. Local physicians ascribe the epidemic to the unhealthy atmosphere consequent upon the continual murky weather. They do not consider the disease in its present shape dangerous, though they admit that it may lead to pneumonia or consumption in some cases. 

A Highly Notable Scene. Philadelphia, December 24. Much as the blizzard two years ago swooped down upon Philadelphia and all this section of the country, so has the influenza come. It is infectious but not contagious. A medical expert said tonight there were over two thousand cases already in Philadelphia, and another high authority said it had reached the city within twenty-four hours and had come with such a rush that he expected within another day to see hundreds and thousands attacked. The epidemic...

In this city seems to be somewhat mild, and has a duration of from two to seven days. It is not limited to any section of territory, but is raging severely along the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Hospital Report: Fourteen of the nurses in the Philadelphia hospital are now in bed, three more having succumbed early this morning. The condition of more who were taken down on Saturday remains about the same. One or two of the nurses tried to get up yesterday, and after a little struggle thought it best to remain where they were. Two of the resident physicians have had slight attacks, but they have kept at their duties.

1890-01-02: MONTREAL PROVINCE OF QUEBEC. District of Montreal (LIQUOR NOTIFICATION). PUBLIC NOTICE. On Wednesday, the fifteenth of January next, in the office of the undersigned notary, No. 1556, Saint Catherine Street, Montreal, at ten o'clock in the forenoon, will be sold to the highest and last bidder the following immovable property depending on the arrangement that has existed between Charles Haynes and Mathilde Lavigne, both deceased, to-wit: That certain lot of ground known under No. 1240 of the official plan and model of reference against the St. James ward in Montreal, bounded in front by Montreal Street, with the building thereon, bearing Nos. 156 and 158 of the corporation numbers. For particulars apply to M. VERHAULT, Notary, Montreal, 97th December, 1886. 

It is well known that we so frequently see, and which so often prove the seed in town for a harvest of consumption, should have immediate and thorough treatment. A teaspoonful of Holtzhausen's Phosphorized Emulsion taken whenever the cough is troublesome will relieve the patient, and if persevered in, will effect a cure in the most obstinate cases. Bronchitis Cured. After spending ten winters south, I was cured by Scott's Emulsion. 116 Contra St, New York, June 16th, 1888. The winter after the great fire in Chicago, I contracted bronchial affections and since then have been obliged to spend nearly every winter south. Last November I was advised to try Scott's Emulsion of Cod Liver Oil with Hypophosphites and to my surprise was relieved at once, and by continuing its use for three months was entirely cured; I gained flesh and strength and was able to stand even the blizzard and attend to business every day.

1890-01-11: FULFORD & CO., Brookville, Ohio. Beware of imitations similar in name, such as Cumberland Railway & Coal Co. PHOSPHORIZED. Those among us who are suffering with bronchitis, or weakness of the throat or lungs, should not delay, but take Scott's Emulsion regularly, according to the advice of their physician, or the directions on the bottle.

1890-01-16: D, January 15. A farmer's wife, having learned that the proceeds of a mortgage on her husband's farm had gone to defray a whiskey bill, at one of the numerous blind pig places here, collected seven more women yesterday and the lot sallied forth with pickaxes, hatchets, and other weapons and broke up several "blind pigs" and destroyed their fixtures and furniture. The proprietors offered but a feeble resistance. A large crowd cheered the women on. Fatal Steam Shovel Explosion. New Brinton, Pa., January 15. At 3:10 o'clock this afternoon, the boiler of a steam shovel used in excavating at Failston, Pa., exploded with such force that several pieces were blown across the river and driven into the ground a fourth of a mile away. The regular force employed in running the machine, a number of Italians, and the conductor and engineer of a train sitting in a tool car were all more or less injured. Wesley Emm, of Pittsburgh, was so badly mangled that he died on his way to the hospital. Nine men were badly hurt and four slightly. Uncle Sam for Peaceful Arbitration. Washington, January 15. Mr. Sherman, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, reported the following concurrent resolution: Resolved, That the President be and hereby is requested to invite from time to time, as circumstances may arise, negotiations with governments with which the United States has or may have diplomatic relations to the end that any differences or disputes between the two governments that cannot be adjusted by diplomatic agency may be referred to a friendly arbitration and be peacefully adjusted by such means. An Unreliable Rumor. New York, January 11. Dunlop's cable news special from London says: "There is a rumor here that the Czar has gone insane owing to the chronic state of fear and worry in which he lives and the events of the past three weeks. He is said to be sunk in a condition of the deepest despondency and insists that his death is drawing near. It is also alleged he is in the habit of soothing his nerves with morphine." Meeting of Civil Engineers. New York, January 15. The American Society of Civil Engineers held their thirty-seventh annual meeting here today. Among those present was Sandford Fleming, of Ottawa. The Secretary's report showed a membership of 180 residents, 130 non-residents, and including honorary, corresponding, associate and fellow members, a total of 1,335. A Death Sentence Commuted. St. Louis, January 15. The death sentence of Madison James, one of the nine Choctaw Indians sentenced to be hanged at Fort Smith, Ark., Thursday, was commuted yesterday to imprisonment for fifteen years. This leaves eight of the nine to hang. Charlie Bullard confidently expects to be reprieved. The others have given up hope. A Historical Barn Burned. Groton, Massachusetts, January 15. The barn on the old Pierce farm, now owned by Osman Gibson, was burned today. The building was erected about the year 1780 as the first Universalist church in America. At the centennial celebration of Universalism in America here in 1870, thousands of Universalists visited the old barn. Another American Blizzard. St. Paul, January 15. Severe weather is reported generally throughout the Northwest. A blizzard is raging at Beardsley, Minn., the drifts being twenty feet high. The first great storm of the season has struck Grand Rapids, extending all over the upper Mississippi region. Trains are delayed; 1,500 miners suspended. Scranton, Pa., January 15. Work at the Henry Clay shaft, the largest mine of the Reading Coal and Iron Company, employing 1,800 men, has been suspended indefinitely this evening because of the stagnation of the coal trade. Brutally Treated by Colombians. New York, January 15. Members of the crew of the American schooner Julien, seized for alleged smuggling by the Colombian gunboat La Papo, have arrived here, and state that they were brutally treated by their captors. Hoosac Tunnel Gas Overcome. Adams, Massachusetts, January 15. Men were overcome by gas in the Hoosac Tunnel today and several barely escaped suffocation. They were brought here and it is thought they will recover. Epidemic of Black Measles. Fort Smith, Kentucky, January 15. The black measles is epidemic here. Mrs. Mitchell and two children have died and Mr. Mitchell is in critical condition. Over one hundred cases are reported. Earthquake in North Carolina. Columbia, B. 

1890-01-22: T, January 21. In the western end of the Territory, hay sells for $20 to $25 a ton, and the holders are not very anxious to dispose of the commodity even at those figures. Dozens of range owners who were reckoned wealthy when winter set in are now practically paupers. In Millinta County, about twenty stockmen have formed a pool for the purpose of rounding up their cattle and sheep and shipping them to Nebraska, where food is plenty. It is estimated that from forty thousand to sixty thousand head of stock will be driven into Kansas and Nebraska for feed during the next month. This is the first season in many years that the range hasn't been open, with plenty of feed. Two thousand head of snake river cattle in Carbon County are reported to be in a starving condition. All game has been driven from the mountains, and there has been an appalling amount of sport hunting. While helpless calves tried to rise to their feet, a cowboy named "Mott" was compelled to take to his heels, leaving a mountain lion to feast on his prey. Heavy Loss of Life. Tacoma, W.T., January 21. At least ten human beings and thousands of cattle and sheep perished in the blizzard which began with the year and raged over Washington for a week. On the Colville reservation, cattle are dying by the hundreds from starvation and thirst. The ground is covered with over two feet of snow on the level, and in some places is drifted mountains high. The keeper of the stage station, twelve miles from Alma, started to walk to town Thursday, and Sunday his body was found on the prairie only a mile from his home, frozen stiff. The mail carrier at Wild Goose Creek perished on the same day, and eight teamsters are known to have lost their lives in the storm. Cattlemen estimate that they will lose one half of their herds this season. The Great Prospects. San Francisco, January 21. The prospects are that the great snow blockade on the Central Pacific will be cleared tonight or tomorrow. There are now three feet of snow at Colfax. At Cisco, the snow is over fifteen feet on the level and in the drifts three or four times as deep. Last evening the Central Pacific opened the road in the Sierras to the five dead engines near Chorlton's Spur. One hundred and fifty snow shovellers digging a trench were surprised and completely buried by snow from a rotary plough, pushed by eleven engines. Nobody was hurt. Ploughs are at work at various places. It is expected the two imprisoned trains between Blue Canyon and Alta will be reached tonight. None of the snow sheds have fallen. The average depth of snow along the sheds is twenty-one feet. Over 1,000 snow shovellers and workmen are on the mountains tonight. A passenger named Lanford died of pneumonia superinduced by an attack of la grippe and was buried by men on snowshoes at Truckee yesterday. Jacob Duta, a snow shoveller, was killed at Colfax.

Headlines: The Gophers, Winnipeg Free Press. We in Manitoba and the Northwest have reason to be thankful. In a state across the border, we read of blizzards that lasted five days, "caused a large amount of damage, killed much livestock, and caused the death of at least ten men." "Ranchmen calculate they will lose half their stock, but 75 percent would be nearer a true estimate." That beats the gophers.

The winter after the great fire in Chicago, I contracted bronchial affections and since then have been obliged to spend nearly every winter south.

18900204: 4R: Heavy field ice was run into, the ship having to be turned to the east-southeast. She remained in the lee all that night, and the next morning it became much heavier, the ship having to go dead slow through it. When daylight broke, nothing but ice was to be seen extending on all sides as far as the eye could see. A tremendous iceberg was in sight about nine miles distant, in lat 47 4.1, long 48 35 west. It appeared to be about eight hundred feet high and a quarter of a mile long, having a high peak which looked like a castle. There was a heavy swell at this time and the large cakes of ice around the ship were surging about the side in a dangerous manner, threatening at times to crush her. By evening, the ship entered clear water, but owing to the proximity of ice, the engines were stopped and the ship lay to till daylight. On the morning of the 27th, there was less wind and a more moderate sea, but nothing could be seen on all sides but ice and icebergs. The ship's head was turned west, and it was not until noon that she got into clear water. The wind then commenced blowing again from the northwest, and large bodies of ice were tossing and crashing dangerously near the ship. At 4 o'clock on the morning of the 28th, the wind changed to east, the glass going down rapidly. It commenced snowing heavily and the sea began rising. By 6:30, the ice began to get thinner, and half an hour later clear water was reached. On the morning of the 29th, the wind and sea increased with thick snow and by 10 o'clock the gale was at its height, with a tremendous sea which swept over the deck from stem to stern, several of the crew being knocked down and badly injured. The tarpaulins were torn from the hatches and it is thought the cargo is badly damaged. At one o'clock, the ship was obliged to lay to. It was then a regular blizzard, it being impossible to see the length of the ship for the dry blinding snow. On the afternoon of the 31st, heavy field ice was again met extending from Sable Island to the Nova Scotia coast. She stemmed through it all night and the next day, only leaving it when twelve miles off Beaver Light. Oil was used for twenty-four hours during the hurricanes of the 17th and 18th, but the wind was so strong that it had no effect. The lowest barometer during the voyage was 28.50.

TWO OR SIX ROWED BARLEYS. Test made at the Experimental Farm and their results. Barley as a throwing country. From our own correspondent! Ottawa, February 3. Bulletin number 6 of the Central Experimental Farm is issued this evening. It is devoted to a report of experiments with barley with a view of proving that two-rowed barley, which is the only kind valuable for export to Great Britain, can be successfully grown in Canada. Professor Saunders, in his report, says that the barley crop is one of great importance to the farmers of Canada. The annual product of this cereal for the past seven years in Ontario alone is estimated by Mr. Illus, in his agricultural statistics of Ontario, at nearly twenty million bushels, while the crop for 1888 is put at over twenty-three million bushels. Statistics from other provinces in the Dominion are not available, but their products would largely augment the figures given. Canadian barley is usually of good quality, and the surplus not required for home consumption has heretofore commanded a ready sale at remunerative prices to maltsters in the United States, and such sales have averaged, during the past eleven years, 6,015,115 bushels annually, yielding an average yearly revenue to Canadian farmers during the period of $5,087,812. The export of barley has materially increased in recent years, and as the country becomes more thickly settled and a larger area of land is brought under cultivation, there will no doubt be larger quantities of this grain to dispose of. During the eleven years referred to, the production of barley in the United States has increased from about 42,000,000 bushels in 1878 to 58,000,000 in 1888, but increasing consumption has kept up with the increased supply and hence the demand for Canadian barley has until recently been maintained. The demand for barley for the manufacture of beer in the United States has of late been materially lessened by the use of various substitutes. From the official returns published in the United States, it appears that while 2.3 bushels of barley were used in the manufacture of a barrel of beer in 1888, only one bushel was used for the same quantity in 1889, the balance chiefly being made up of corn, rice, and sorghum. As these ingredients enable the brewer to make his beer at less cost than from barley alone, it is scarcely probable that Canadian barley, however good it may be, will continue to find a market in the United States in such quantities and at such prices as in the past. It is important, then, for Canada that other outlets be provided for her surplus barley, and the only other country which requires more barley than it produces is Great Britain. The average importations of barley into the United Kingdom for the past eleven years have been about 6,000,000 bushels, the import for 1888 having been over 4,000,000 bushels. A considerable quantity of this is six-rowed barley, but that is used only for brewing.

SHIP MARINE ENGINES - AGME MODEL! COAL - OIL, FOR FUEL.

18900207: H, February 6. The Furnas line steamship "Claudia," eighteen days out, arrived from London to-night. The Allan's steamer "Peruvian," Captain Wallace, from Liverpool, January 21, with mails and passengers, arrived today after a stormy voyage. On January 20, a tremendous sea boarded the ship on the starboard side, carrying away part of the bridge and badly crushing First Officer Goodwin. He has been confined to his room ever since. The ship also received other damage about this dock during the passage. Two icebergs were passed on the way, but the ship kept south and saw no field ice. When three days out from Moville, she sighted an abandoned Norwegian barque, but did not ascertain her name. The Peruvian's passenger list was as follows: H. O. Bowers, Mr. McLemont, James Olney, Mrs. Olney, and 23 intermediate and 68 steerage passengers. A representative of the English syndicate that is acquiring the principal breweries in Canada was at Halifax and opened negotiations for line Dougall's distillery. While in this city, the syndicate representative inspected S. Claud & Sons' brewery and the brewery of Keith & Sons. The agent was given the prices at which the establishment could be purchased. The Nova Scotia Fruit Growers' Association is in session at Wolfville. It was stated that speculators had made $20,000 profit on apples purchased in Annapolis Valley last season and that by ignorant and dishonest packing, our fruit growers had only received three-fifths of the actual value of their product and had lost $200,000. It was stated that prior to the Government giving a subsidy to the Furnas line, the freight steamers from Halifax and St. John to London, the fruit growers were afforded competition by the Anchor and Furnas line, with the freight at seventy cents a barrel, but the $25,000 subsidy to the Furnas boat had driven the Anchor line out of this region and consequently the rate had jumped up to over one dollar a barrel. The association passed a resolution that "a Government subsidy to any line of freight steamers to London is prejudicial to the interests of the shippers of apples to Great Britain."

BLOW OF RAIN. Fine today, with easterly wind and rising temperature. Toronto, February 6, 11 p.m. To-night the pressure is highest over the Ottawa Valley, and there are two storm centers to the westward, one in Minnesota, moving southeast, and the other in Texas, moving northeast.

Please let me know if you need any further adjustments! and Mr. Burney, one of the firm, was instantly killed, and a workman whose name could not be learned was injured. Mr. Burney's body was immediately taken from the wreck. It was mangled almost beyond recognition. Many houses in Kiowa were damaged. At Uniontown, the roof was blown off the M. E. church, a part of it alighting on the house of John Brown, just north of the church, crushing it to pieces. The lower part of the church is so badly shattered that it will have to be taken down. The roof of the large new building lately built by the Pennsylvania Construction Company was also blown off. A wagon driven by James Bush was blown over Gray's Hill. The wagon is lying on its back, with the wheels whirling in the air. Postmaster Linker's new house was nearly demolished; also James Fratikenberry's house, and John Wringer's house was leveled to the ground. The telephone and electric light wires are all down. 

Narrow Escape: None of the coke works are running south of Uniontown. The Bodstone Coke Company's offices at Brownfield were demolished. The end was blown out of the engine house at Leith and Warren's glass works. The roof of the Lutheran church was also blown off. 

At Connellsville, J.D., February 7: A severe snow and wind storm is raging here. The roof of the courthouse has been blown off. 

Kitpokn, Minn., February 7: The worst blizzard within the recollection of the oldest inhabitant is raging. The wind is from the north, and the air is a cloud of snow. The thermometer registers 10 degrees below zero, and it is growing colder. 

Winnipeg, February 7: The worst storm experienced here for a decade is now raging, and Winnipeg may be said to be completely snowed in. The blizzard began last night and shows no sign of abatement, but as the temperature is comparatively mild, no serious or fatal results are feared. Houses are snowed in, and the occupants have to dig their way out. Sidewalks and roads are in many places impassable, schools are shut down, streetcars drawn by four horses make trips only at long intervals, trains are behind schedule, and business is generally suspended.

Bronchitis Cured: After spending ten winters south, I was cured by Scott's Emulsion. 140 Cent St., New York, I "must" 28th, 1888. (The winter after the great fire in Chicago I contracted bronchial affections and since then have been obliged to spend nearly every winter south. Last November I was advised to try Scott's Emulsion of Cod Liver Oil with Hypophosphites and to my surprise was relieved at once, and by continuing its use for three months was entirely cured. I gained flesh and strength and was able to stand even the blizzard and attend to business every day.)

1890-0219: 1887 Wheat and Flour: 2,101,000; 1,848,000; 2,170,000 Corn: 400,000; 847,000; 831,000. 

The following were the amounts of grain on passage to the continent on the dates mentioned: Feb 15, Feb 18, Feb 10. 

Wheat, qrs Corn, qrs Wheat, qrs Corn, qrs. 

The amount of wheat in sight on this continent and afloat to Europe is 51,037,000 bushels, an increase of 603,000 bushels compared with a week ago, an increase of 127,000 with two weeks ago, an increase of 67,000 with three weeks ago, a decrease of 302,000 with four weeks ago, and a decrease of 2,408,000 with a year ago. 

The following table shows the total quantity of wheat in sight according to the Chicago statement of the visible supply and the amount afloat to Europe. 

January 4, 1890: 64,436,000; February 10, 1880: 63,134,000; February 18, 1888: 63,106,000; February 10, 1887: 81,084,000; February 20, 1889: 70,001,000. 

United States Grain Market: Wheat in Chicago today was about steady, closing at 74c for February, 76c for March, 77c for May, 77c for June, and 76c for July. Corn closed at 25c for March, 28c for April, and 30c for May. Oats closed at 19c for February, 19c for March, 21c for May, and 20c for July. 

Irwin, Green & Co.'s Chicago special to the Gazette says: The abnormal weather conditions have furnished reasons for a further heaviness in grain, and especially in wheat, while lower freights have mostly operated to depress corn and oats. The argument for the latter was overwhelming because of the small consumption on the farm, which was the direct consequence of the season. The almost unprecedented absence of winter weather in months when it is expected to put in an appearance is one of the chief causes of weakness in all cereals, and every day that the cold wave holds aloof lessens the probability of its coming at all on this side of summer heats. Already some are counting confidently on the uninterrupted enjoyment of spring weather during the next three months, to be followed by an early and abundant harvest. It is, however, dangerous to commit oneself to this theory, as nature has always furnished her own compensations in the past and can be trusted to do so this time, and the only trouble is nobody can tell when. 

It is a historical fact that most mild winters have been followed by severe weather just at the time when it was not wanted, and the crops have suffered in consequence. This may be an exception to the rule, but analogies are against it, as the sun is gathering strength daily but is a long way below the equinox, although the month in which it reaches that point has ere this been marked by blizzards of fearful intensity. We are so nearly out of the wood now as to justify a shout of joy at having escaped its perils, and it goes without saying that if heavy frosts should come, each day's delay will only make the evil worse in the winter wheat fields, and if deferred till the end of this month it means the failure of half the crop. If the frosts hold off till the middle of March, the result would probably be even more disastrous as the stalks, full of precociously formed juices, would burst asunder by the act of freezing, leaving the roots too much exhausted of their vitality to be equal to the task of forming another ear-bearing stem, and nothing would be left but to reseed for another crop. 

Of the prospects in the spring wheat regions, no more can be said than that all is problematic, but a cold summer following a warm winter would find large quantities of grain unmatured on the arrival of frosts next winter. The recent news from other continents certainly does not favor the weakness in wheat here. The stocks in the United Kingdom are low, and there is an official endorsement of the sometime since reported heavy falling off in the Russian yield, as also in some other parts of Europe. The acreage in India is conceded to be less than that of last year, and according to the latest mail advices, the average yield promises to be poor for want of sufficient rain, and now comes the confirmation news that the Australian crop has panned out far below expectations. For this reason, several ships under charter to carry wheat have been diverted to other services. It is expected that the twelve million bushels to be received in Western Europe from Australia will not be delivered, and more heavy rain in California threatens to leave a small export surplus there. 

As was noted in our letter of a week ago, the future of the wheat market hinges mostly on the weather, and that statement holds good now. If we have no winter, the price of wheat may sink farther; if we have yet to experience any really cold spell, for the bulls will not need any further encouragement to hold. In that event, there would probably be such a rush to buy as has seldom been witnessed in this or any other market, and I can only suggest that it may not be wise to run the risk of getting caught on the short side in such a storm. 

Corn is stated to have reached the lowest point known since August 1862, and it was only brought over short distances to this market. Some men in trade say they expect a reduction in the rail rates to bring a large increase in the receipts, sufficiently so to force a further decline. There may be some mistake about this, but in any event, the visible supply decreased last week, and there was probably a much larger decrease in the quantities in transit by rail, which are not included in the statement, and a good deal of covering by the shorts was done this week on the idea of larger receipts, and have been fully discounted before arrival. Corn has "had no friends" for a long while past, but that fact does not prove an awakening to be impossible, and there is room for a short. 

Provisions are staggered by the fact of big stocks and the fear of larger receipts of hogs, the latter being favored by better country roads and good prices paid for hogs compared with corn, but there are willing buyers of the product on every slight decline, and the stuff is already so low as to make it easy to carry large stocks, pending the arrival of orders from willing consumers of cheap meat.

Receipts posted on 'Change today were as follows: 

TRAINS DELAYED BY THE STORM: All trains are very much behind time today on account of the storm. The Montreal train this morning arrived at Belair at 7 o'clock but was stopped there two hours by snow. Mr. McShane and two other gentlemen, getting tired, got out and walked to Lorette, a distance of three and a half miles, through the blinding blizzard. All three were more or less frozen, and when they arrived at Lorette they had the satisfaction of learning that the train had passed through some time before. They telegraphed to Quebec for a special train and arrived here not long after the regular train. The train for Montreal, which should have left here at 10 p.m., had not left at midnight, but the officials hoped to get it through. 

THE TIMBER DEFALCATION: At the request of Messrs. Bryant, Powell & Bryant, the London timber merchants, Judge Bouthier has named John Y. Welch, of this city, provisional guardian of their establishment here, left vacant by defaulter C.

A New Departure at the Thistle: Midwinter would seem an unpropitious time for plants of any sort to bloom outside a hothouse. Now a curling rink, by no stretch of imagination, can be written down as a hothouse. Scotland's natural plant is a hardy and rugged one that persists in growing and making itself felt under the most adverse circumstances. There was a blizzard all day; an inconsiderate wind blew one around corners and blew nicely granulated snow into every unprotected corner of one's anatomy. It was wretchedly uncomfortable outdoors, and the evening was worse than the day. Under these conditions, it was strange that even such a hardy growth as the Thistle should prosper. But the Thistles not only bloomed, but actually out-bloomed themselves last night. While candy snow was quietly filtering down, innumerable necks and black-haired men wore white moustaches and were forced to breathe through their mouths; while fur collars were no protection against the winds and galoshes were not impervious to impassable snow banks, there was one possibility where disagreeable elements could be converted into actual enjoyableness. That possibility lay in the curling rinks. 

Never before in the history of Montreal have what are generally looked on as the young men taken so active an interest in curling as during the present season. Not very long ago, the young men looked at the game as one only fitted for their older counterparts. That was because they had never tried it, knew nothing about it; but from the superiority of their ignorance found themselves competent to speak. Then a few more daring than the rest thought they would try it. They came, they saw, they tried it, but they did not master it immediately to any great extent. But they found out one bit of valuable information, and that was that curling was a game adapted to men of all ages who appreciate good, healthy, sturdy exercise. It only required a beginning. 

One by one the feeders came in. Their arms got sore, their legs got sore for the first few days, and without thinking of the tee, they thought the right side of the hog line was a consummation devoutly to be wished for. That was the hardest stage, and it was soon over. A little later they wicked, and drew and raised and guarded and made ports and swept and finally were curlers, and most of them very creditable curlers, too. Now there are none more enthusiastic than the young members, and the older and sturdier hands are glad to see it. With the infusion of new blood, there will necessarily be some innovations, not in the game, for that would savor of the sacrilegious. 

Among the young curlers, the members of the Thistle club are perhaps the foremost. Somebody who is an admirer of the gentler sex got an idea that maybe the ladies would appreciate a gala night. The mere mention of it was enough to start between fifteen and twenty young men working heart and soul. The older members of the club nodded their heads sagely; they remembered when they were young themselves, and of course they approved of the idea, and the use of the rink and club rooms was turned over to the young members for last evening. Reception, decoration, and refreshments committees were appointed, and how well those committees did their work could only be fully appreciated by being present at the rink. Everything seemed new. The dull monotonous white of the walls was made bright with the colors of miscellaneous bunting. It seemed as if the building had been rigged out for a ball; and on the cold, unsympathetic air, under the deft hands of "George," was laid with a silken design in blue. The ladies were to be there, and of course nothing was left undone. Even the creamy hila pipe and the fragrant cigar were to be on hand. 

The rink was crowded, but not uncomfortably; there were over 100 ladies and an equivalent number of gentlemen present; the ladies even got excited and many left the warm precincts of the club room to get a better view in the chilling rink. Pretty feet were tipped resolutely on the platform to keep them warm; dainty hands clapped warmly to encourage the players. With their natural aptitude, they soon discerned a nice bit of play and applauded accordingly, which applause was frequently ornamented with just the suspicion of a scream. Then willing swains insisted that the ladies have refreshments, and the keen cold air and the excitement of the game gave a sense of appetite that Crosse & Blackwell would give a fortune to patent. 

Under the circumstances, is it to be wondered at that the keenest rivalry prevailed among the players? Why, in olden times, knights entered the jousts, splintered lances on each other and died happy for less than half the smiles that were showered on the contestants last night. And was any conquering hero ever prouder than the winning rinks when one of the fair ones whispered, "I'm so glad you won; that game was just lovely," or some other phrase equally pleasant? There was some splendid play, too, that called forth the plaudits of the more experienced and less impressionable ones; for instance, the last shot made by Mr. Stewart. His opponent was laying shot and well guarded. There was an almost impassable port, not two inches to spare, and down the center line came the iron. There was no occasion to sweep for that shot. Clean through the port it came, drove out the shot stone with a bang and lay almost in the center of the tee. That was a beauty, and amid well-merited applause, the match was over. 

The news was: 

LINK NO 1 B, February 20: The provincial Legislature opened today in the midst of a blizzard, which raged with great violence. It was the worst storm of the season. The snow drifted badly, and business was practically suspended. Governor McLellan delivered a lengthy speech from the throne. The Grit Government, on the eve of the election, has become quite hopeful, and the speech congratulated the Legislature on the large measure of prosperity that our province has enjoyed during the last year. Our fishermen in some localities do not share in that prosperity as fully as other classes, but get compensated in some degree for a shut down in that branch of industry. There was gratifying activity. Good harvests rewarded the labors of the farmer. Coal mining operations were extensively carried on. Gold mining was prosecuted with much success. The condition of business throughout the world gave prosperity to our shipowners and revived our shipbuilding industry, and trade and commerce generally were much improved. The Nova Scotia Central Railway from Middleton to Lunenburg has been opened. The local government will subsidize a railway from the Intercolonial to Ironfield at East River Pit, where smelting works are to be established.

The engine and cars did not leave the track.

**The Fight for the Fair**  
Washington, February 23  
The eve of the great free-for-all race for the World's Fair has been used by the friends of the four contestants in getting into the best possible position for the opening tomorrow and in arranging plans and counterplans. It is on all hands conceded that Chicago will bring prominently to the front, and that the Lake City will capture the first heat, but there is a wide difference of opinion and a great amount of uncertainty as to how many heats it will require for any one of the four rivals to distance her competitors. There is speculation as to whether any fair will be held. The opposition to the holding of a fair is gaining ground, and many predict that a formidable array of members will be found opposed to any fair before a site is chosen.

**18900227: CYCLONES AND BLIZZARDS**  
Tennessee Towns Nearly Wiped Out by a Violent Wind Storm  
CLOUD BURSTS AND FLOODS  
The Great Vantage in Many Hints - Railroad Washed Out and Farm Houses Destroyed  
Memphis, Tenn, February 20  
Brownsville, Tenn, six miles northeast of Memphis, on the Louisville & Nashville railroad, was struck by a cyclone at 4 o'clock yesterday morning. Half of the business houses of the town were unroofed and many were materially damaged, while several buildings were totally destroyed. Following the cyclone came a flood of rain that completely drenched the goods in the unroofed houses. The losses will aggregate $50,000. The only loss of life reported is that of a woman living three miles from Brownsville, who was struck by a falling tree and killed. Her two children were severely injured.

**Madden, Terrible Work**  
The woman was Mrs. James Cooper. The storm struck Brownsville while its inhabitants slept and had done its terrible work before the real situation was realized. It came from a southwesterly direction and was preceded by a rumbling noise, which lasted a few seconds and then burst upon the town in a sprawling fury. Residences rocked like cradles and heavy brick buildings trembled like leaves as the storm swept by. The storm did much damage at other places.

**Marvelous Escape of School Children**  
At Marianna, Ark, the new Christian church was completely demolished, Lester's cotton shed was blown away and the roofs of several other buildings were lifted off. Three miles from town, a negro schoolhouse, with 65 children in it, was blown from its foundation, but no one was hurt. The White River at Batesville, Ark, rose eight feet in a few hours, washing away culverts and delaying trains badly. Three houses were blown down near Pleville, and several buildings flattened in the southeastern portion of the country. The Hot Springs old observatory, which had stood for several years on the summit of the Hot Springs mountain, was leveled by the gale. 

**Farm Houses Mown Down**  
The storm played havoc with the entire country between Hot Springs and the Ouachita River. Many farm houses were torn to atoms and the path of the storm is one mass of wrecked timber. Large trees were uprooted and in many places the roads are completely blockaded by fallen timber. That lives were lost is more than probable, owing to the destruction of so many farm houses. Considerable damage was done to buildings and fences at Little Rock and at Alexander. A school house was blown down and nine children injured.

**Great Damage by Flood**  
Cincinnati, February 28  
A serious flood is threatened in the Ohio River. Lima, Ohio, February 26  
Many country bridges in this section have been swept away by a flood and also the railroad bridges of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton railroads. Heavy damage to houses and crops is reported. Indianapolis, Ind, February 20  
Considerable damage has been done to railroad property all over Indiana by heavy rains. Nashville, Tenn, February 26  
Two spans of the Tennessee River bridge at Johnstown were blown out during Monday's storm.

**Cloudburst and Tornado**  
Cambridge City, Ind, February 20  
A cloudburst on Monday night caused Martindale Creek near this place to rise so quickly that a woman and three children named Hull were drowned. They belonged to a party of gypsies. Casselberry, Ill, February 20  
Monday night this place was visited by the heaviest rainfall that has occurred for fifteen years. A tornado at Bainbridge, fifteen miles east, completely demolished the residence of J. T. Sweeney. There were several persons in the building and all were injured. Several buildings were blown from their foundations.

**Blizzards in the Northwest**  
Ashland, Wis, February 26  
The worst snow and wind storms of the season are prevailing here. It has been snowing and blowing ever since Sunday night. Osceola, Wis, February 26  
Yesterday afternoon a blizzard of great violence swept down upon this city. Watertown, Wis, February 26  
The most severe snowstorm in two years raged here yesterday and last night. Railroads are blocked to some extent.

There was a terrible storm at Lake Tahoe Monday. Small crafts were smashed to pieces and the wharves severely shaken. Trees, houses, and wood piles were blown to pieces. The snow is drifting along the road here, covering the station houses and burying logging camps.

Vila I have no rain-fall cold in the Northwest.  
Toronto, February 26, 11 p.m.  
The depression has moved with decreasing energy from Ohio to Western Nova Scotia, giving a continuance of dull weather, with local rain and sleet in Quebec and the Maritime provinces. The high area has spread from the Northwest to the lower lake region, but with much diminished energy, causing only a small change in temperature. The weather continues fine in the Northwest and the temperature is rising slowly. 

Minimum temperatures: Calgary, 30 below; Prince Albert, 40 below; Winnipeg, 30 below; Toronto, 36; Montreal, 34; Quebec, 30; Halifax, 28.  
River St. Lawrence: North to east wind, mostly cloudy, with light snow or rain, stationary or a little lower temperature.

If they fail in compelling the board to continue to furnish quotations, they will have to devise some other means of getting the prices made on the board. Just what plan they will adopt has not been determined upon, but they declare they will trade in produce in spite of anything the board of trade may do. The telegraph officials do not wish to say anything about the matter, but they are largely interested in the fight. It means the loss of a great business by the companies if the board succeeds in its present intentions, unless they can meet the contingency in some manner. A bitter fight is in prospect.

68 Bronchitis Cured  
After spending ten winters South, I was cured by Scott's Emulsion, 150 Centre St, New York, June 11th, 1888. The winter after the great fire in Chicago, I contracted bronchial affections and since then have been obliged to spend nearly every winter south. Last November, I was advised to try Scott's Emulsion of Cod Liver Oil with Hypophosphites, and to my surprise was relieved at once, and by continuing its use for three months was entirely cured, gained flesh and strength, and was able to stand even the blizzard and attend to business every day.

Y, March 21  
Provincial Detective Murray of Ontario arrived in Buffalo yesterday and left again today. He stopped at the Stafford House, where Mr. and Mrs. Burchell, Benwell, and Pelly stopped on their arrival here February 16th, and from where Burchell and Benwell started together on the morning of February 17th on that fateful journey to the Blenheim swamp. Mr. Murray came to Buffalo to trace back the line of Burchell's movements and to make available at the trial certain interesting evidence. It will be remembered that Burchell on Thursday, February 27th, sent a despatch from Buffalo to himself at Niagara Falls and signed it "Stafford," as if coming from the Stafford House. The evident purpose of the bogus telegram was to substantiate statements made by Burchell at Niagara Falls and to induce Pelly to start on that wild goose chase to New York, after Benwell. Mr. Murray heard the statements of the Stafford House people and then gave it as his unhesitating opinion that Burchell had sent the telegram to himself. The original of the dispatch is in the possession of Manager Burnett of the Great North Western Telegraph Company here, is carefully guarded, and will be produced at the trial. Mr. Murray, being interviewed by a reporter, said: "I shall go to New York in a few days and trace the movements of Burchell and his party there. Perhaps I shall be compelled to go to England. There are many gaps here and there that must be filled. There is one of three years in Burchell's life I must know all his transactions during that time." "Do you still think that others beside Benwell have been lured to their death in Canada?" "I have not the slightest doubt of it. Only yesterday I received some very important evidence on this point. I got a letter from a gentleman in New York, a very prominent business man, speaking of five young Englishmen...

Englishmen who, to gain his knowledge, came to this country to become farm pupils. Two of them disappeared at Niagara Falls. They gave directions to have their letters sent to the Falls for two weeks, but their letters were never called for, and the two young men have never been heard of since. I know that Burchell has been out to this country several times, and I have very little doubt that he is one of a gang of conspirators who were in league to first rob and then murder their victims. Besides, after looking up Burchell's movements in New York, I shall investigate the statement of the New York businessman, and perhaps may be compelled to continue the investigation in England. 

"Then, Mr. Murray, it may be said that you are not working on Burchell's case, then?" 

"That is true," he answered; "I am working on both ends of the case now. There may be some surprising developments." 

"Another of Burchell's lies was discovered by Mr. Murray at the Stafford House here. When the English party were leaving for the Falls February 18th, the clerk asked Burchell where he intended stopping at the Falls, with the idea of advising him of a good place to stop at. 

"Oh, that's all right," returned Burchell, briefly; "I have a place down there." 

Detective Murray is firmly convinced that Mrs. Burchell was cognizant of her husband's intentions to despoil his victims of their money, though he will not go so far as to say she was in the conspiracy of murder. The manner in which she coincided in many of her husband's lies strengthens the conviction in the mind of the detective. He says Burchell is the coolest, most wonderful man he ever saw. 

**News from Down East: The Peruvian's Nonappearance**  
**Halifax, March 21**  
The Furness Line steamer Boston City arrived today, twenty-two days out from Hamburg, for New York, short of coal. She experienced heavy weather, had her decks swept, and had a rough time generally. She could not make Sydney on account of ice. Wednesday night she encountered a snow blizzard. She takes 500 tons of coal and proceeds to New York tomorrow. Nothing has been yet heard of the mail steamer Peruvian, now sixteen days out. It is feared some accident has happened to her machinery. The palatial residence of the late Hon. James Butler has been purchased by Archbishop O'Brien for a globe house.

**18900417:** D's diploma is as good as a saloon license. It will not be long before the ranks of medicine in Iowa are reinforced by hatches of "doctors" whose knowledge of mixed drinks and bone races will be rather more marked than their acquaintance with the materia medica. A Scotch Catholic, a gentleman from Washington, DC, and two other correspondents have sent letters bearing on the French evangelization mission. Though there is no fault to be found with the character of the communications, it has been deemed better not to insert them. The issue is an unprofitable one for newspaper discussion, and like others of a similar character, has a tendency to drift away from the point at first raised into subjects that have ever been and probably always will be occasions of difference between Christians. And, it may be added, such discussions never made converts, one way or the other. The nomination of Mr. Landry, MP, to succeed Judge Botsford, besides putting an able man on the bench, will necessitate an election in Kent County. This is a New Brunswick constituency, with few manufacturing interests. Its industries are fishing, shipbuilding, lumbering, and agriculture, those the Opposition hold, most injured by the present Government's policy. If this contention were true, the Liberals should carry the county; but they will not. The Liberals are not in touch with the real sentiment of Canada. Elsewhere we republish from the Times of April 2 an account of the mission to this country of the Hon. Henry Boyle in search of his brother, Lord Boyle, who had for some years been ranching in the Northwest, where he was well known for taking an interest in the country's affairs and as a member of the Northwest Council. By his father's recent death, he has fallen heir to the earldom of Shannon, and his family is naturally uneasy as to his whereabouts. The Hamilton Spectator says there is a growing suspicion among thoughtful Reformers that Archbishop Cleary is subsidized by Mr. Meredith. There is enough in the politico-religious situation in Ontario at the moment to give point to the Spectator's rather irreverent remark. The Archbishop's utterances have made as many votes against as for the separate school system as it exists in Ontario today. The last storm down in Nebraska blew the farmers' crops out of the ground. This is a variation of the plague, but it is just as distressing as the blizzard, the cyclone, the sandstorm, or the drought. It looks as if the one salvation for the deluded United States agriculturists is to move up to Canada while there is yet room. The movement to exclude the English members from office in the Montreal Bar has the appearance of a case of Satan finding mischief for idle hands to do. Not many of the authors are in the running for the Banco. Expenses of four years of Mercier rule: $15,163,111; expenses of four years under Conservative administration: $13,190,904, an increase of three million to the expenses of the province. It is a pity a United States contingent could not be arranged for Sir Richard Cartwright before the next parliamentary elections; he would be sure of a walk-over. Within a fortnight, two murderers have been sentenced to death in Ontario and Quebec. Justice is beginning to catch up with the homicidal outbreak.

**18900703:** I believe the gathering separated about 3 o'clock, singing the National Anthem and Vive la Canadienne. NOTES OF THE EVENING. Mr. Pacaud presided at the press table. Mrs. and Miss Pacaud presided in the gallery. Mr. Laurier applauded all Mr. Mercier's condemnations of the veto power. Mr. Herder's mention of Mr. Laurier as "my chief," elicited rounds of cheering. About 200 ladies came into the gallery during dinner and remained until midnight or after. The Harmony band under Mr. Edmond Hardy rendered a good programme during dinner. Madame Mercier and party got a hearty welcome upon entering the gallery, the band playing "Vive la Canadienne." The Premier spoke clearly and slowly but was apparently much fatigued and did not appear at his best. The hall was handsomely decorated with flags and bunting and reflected much credit upon the good taste of Mr. Deullao. There was a fair attendance of English Liberals of the "Old Guard," the recent victory having evidently brought them back to the fold. Mr. McShane distinguished himself twice. Once was when he led off the cheering for "My Premier," and the other when he started the recognition of Mr. Shehyrl. It was noticeable that while Mr. Mercier was most particular in his emphasis about the Parti National and the Parti national, Mr. Laurier and the English speakers of the evening all spoke of it as the Liberal party. President Gouin's complaint that the Government had no "organ" in Montreal must have been refreshing to Mr. Beaugrand, who was present, and to Hon. Victor Mitchell, who was not present, although announced to speak. Mr. Prefontaine's declaration in favor of unrestricted reciprocity is held by some to confirm the rumor that Mr. Erastus Wiman is coming to the rescue of both the Elevated Railway and Longueuil Bridge schemes, in both of which the member for Chambly is interested. Those among us who are suffering with bronchitis or weakness of the throat or lungs should not delay but take Scott's Emulsion regularly, according to the advice of their physician or the directions on the bottle. Always ask for Scott's Emulsion and be sure you get Scott's Emulsion.

18900925: B. Fredericton school going to Toronto, and Toronto coming here. The decision of Sir Adolphe is supreme; only if we could be heard we would say please leave to carry out the advantages you have conferred on this town and county by establishing a military school here with a French-Canadian commandant. The St. Johns school is considered the French school of the country; it is nearly so; the two nationalists agree well together. It is hoped the Hon Minister will coincide in these views coming home. "A large number of Canadians who settled in Dakota and other parts of the United States are daily returning to Canada convinced that they can do better at home than abroad." 

From black Dakota's blizzards, From Kansas' arid plains; From retrograde New England, They're coming home again. Home to that fair Dominion Where plenty smiles on toil, Where to labor's honest effort Responds the fertile soil: Where nature's gracious bounty Extends o'er land and main. To their own fair country, Canada, they're coming home again. Misled by false pretenses They strayed away from home, Imbued with futile fancies, In lords and lands to roam; Fair fortune seemed to call them To some more favored shore, And they left their own Dominion To return to it no more. In fancy's dream they pictured A country rich with grain, But the picture proved illusive And they're coming home again. Far sadder, wiser, poorer, By experience dearly taught, Their fancy's visions faded, And their daydreams come to naught; They turn their backs on labor Which would not repay their pain, And with hope once more rekindled They're coming home again. To the land of their adoption, From it no more to roam, To their own fair country, Canada, once more they're coming home.

The Snow Storm in the Northwest States - Heavy Mexican Earthquake. Jersey Anarchists in Jail. Columbus, Ohio, November 9. Allen W. Thorman, in an address at a Democratic jollification meeting at Hamilton, said: "Yet this was the issue plain and simple brought about by the McKinley bill; and to the man Grover Cleveland, who three years ago boldly and fearlessly attacked the whole system, more than to any other do we owe this victory. Never for one moment, amid all the abuse that was heaped upon him did he falter or his courage fail. Believing in the truth and justice of his position, believing that the Government had no right to take money from the pockets of the people solely for the benefit of a particular class, he continued year after year when others hesitated to battle for the right and now, when all are eager to join in the fray, certainly this fact that he dared to lead, when scarcely any dared to follow, shows the mettle he is made of, and I believe the people will see to it that he shall be again chosen as their leader in 1892. If ever a man spoke the truth surely he did when he said a few days ago: 'No one has a greater right to rejoice than I have.'" 

Heavy Snow in Northwestern States. St. Paul, Minn., November 9. A snowstorm raged yesterday morning in the southeast of this state and has kept up since. A Yerkes, SD, despatch says that a heavy snowstorm began there yesterday morning. Old settlers and Indians say that winter has set in and the ground will be under snow from now until spring. Colder weather is also expected by them. A high wind accompanied the snow at Rice Lake, Minn., and Lakefield, Albert Lea, St. James, and Willmar. All report heavy snow, with prospects of its lasting some time. Some light flurries of snow had been reported before this season, but this is really the first snow of the season throughout Southern Minnesota and South Dakota. Lincoln, Neb., November 9. Reports from Brown County, in Northwest Nebraska, tell of a very heavy storm. It has been snowing continually for fourteen hours and the wind is all that is lacking to make a mild form of a blizzard.

18901217: LOST IN A BLIZZARD. An Aged Couple Edward and Cawl Terrington Charlottetown, PEI, December 16. Last Friday an elderly couple by the name of Higglint, living in the West Royalty, left their home to attend market. After transacting business in town they started for home about 5 o'clock. It had been snowing all day, and toward evening the storm had assumed the character of a blizzard and the drifting snow was blinding. They struck off the road to take a short cut for their home and wandered into a forty-acre field, got bewildered and lost their way. Battered with snow and benumbed with cold they tried in vain to get their bearings until completely exhausted when both lay down to die within a few minutes' walk of home. On Sunday morning search was instituted and about noon Mrs. Higglint was found sitting on the sleigh still living. She was carried to her home but she soon succumbed. Mr. Higglint was also found a short distance from the sleigh. He was not so badly frozen as his wife and he was taken at once to the hospital and his condition is considered very critical. The suffering and exposure have affected his mind and he is unable to give any account of his wandering and experience of the two nights and day and a half he had spent in the snow.

In both cities all the theatres and other places of amusement are closed and the streets have stopped running. The blizzard is so fierce that it is dangerous to venture out. Traffic is at a complete standstill and the streets are almost totally deserted. 

Berlin, January 8. The severe weather here and throughout northern Germany is causing much suffering. A number of fishing vessels are icebound in the lower Elbe, many of them are known to be short of provisions and there are no means of rendering assistance. Twenty ships are now drifting about in the ice helpless under the fury of a bitter nor'easter. 

Paris, January 8. Bitterly cold weather prevails here and is causing much distress among the poorer classes. The bodies of three persons who had been frozen to death during the night were picked up in the streets this morning. 

London, January 8. The body of a man, frozen to death, was found this morning in the streets of Preston. The 200 clerks in the London Postal Savings Bank, suspended for refusing to work overtime, have apologized and have been reinstated.

In spite of his ability, the prestige and the incredible energy he displayed, his political death is a matter of a few months only. He preferred eating the forbidden fruit to being the liberator of Ireland, and now let him accept the consequences of his acts. In the end, it will lead him to the declaration of his episcopacy which has just said: 'Assuredly Catholic Ireland, which is distinguished by so high a standard of virtue and purity in its social life, will not accept for its chief a man so utterly dishonored and so unworthy of the confidence of Christians.'" This article has in all probability been published in view of a meeting of Irishmen that is to be held this week to decide what stand they will take. The chances now are that they will repudiate Parnell, although up to the present they have been strongly in his favor. The Inquest on the victims of the recent accident on the Intercolonial will be resumed tomorrow, when Light and Scott, the engineers, will be examined. The Inquest will probably be concluded on Tuesday. A fire broke out this evening in Robitaille's hotel, St. Vallier Street. The upper flat was gutted, but the flames were prevented from spreading. The loss will be about $400. A blizzard set in tonight about 8 o'clock, and the streets are well nigh impassable. At midnight the Montreal train had not yet arrived.

**Ait Road**  
A respectable farmer named Fabian Auger, the father of a large family, who resides at Lacroix Lake, was returning home from church in a sleigh with his wife and several children on Sunday last, when he decided, after riding part of the way, to walk the rest of the journey, telling his wife to drive on, as he had quite a piece to go. Nothing was thought of the father not reaching home by night as it was imagined he had called into some neighbor's on the way. Becoming alarmed on Monday morning at his continued absence, a messenger was dispatched to hunt up Auger. The body of the missing man was found frozen stiff in the middle of the road only two miles from home.

New York, January 10  
Shortly after 11 o'clock, Jay Gould said everything was progressing smoothly in the railroad conference and that in all probability the work of the whole conference would be ended inside of two hours. The advisory board was in session all the afternoon, and upon the adjournment at 6 p.m., Roswell Miller, the Chairman, announced that the board agreed upon a form of organization and adopted by-laws to govern the same. The only other business accomplished was to elect the following officers for one year: Roswell Miller, president; members of the finance committee, Messrs. Hughitt, Gould, Cable, Oakes, and Manvel. The board adjourned to meet on Monday morning. The by-laws adopted today are designed to carry out the principles of the President's agreement, entered into at the meeting here December 10 last. This agreement has been formally ratified by the directors of the following companies: Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, Chicago & Northwestern, Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific, Denver & Rio Grande, Great Northern, Illinois Central, Iowa Central, Missouri Pacific, Northern Pacific, Rio Grande, Western Southern Pacific, Union Pacific, and Wabash. The Wabash company is represented for that portion of its line from Chicago to East St. Louis and west of said line, and the Southern Pacific only for that portion of its lines west of the Mississippi River. The tenth and last section reads as follows: The board of directors of any company, a member of the association, may fill any vacancy which may be caused by disability, absence, or resignation of either of its members, which action is to be properly certified to the advisory board under the seal of the company.  

**France's Possible Ally**  
The Funeral of the Duke of Leuchtenberg  
Paris, January 10  
The funeral of the Duke Leuchtenberg took place today at the Russian church. The funeral cortege was headed by detachments of cavalry and artillery. Prince Orloff and Baron Pivcholf preceded the funeral on foot, bearing richly embroidered velvet cushions, upon which were placed the duke's many decorations. The car itself was covered with the golden pall, used only in the case of the burial of members of the Russian Imperial family. Following the car was President Carnot's military household in full uniform. The duke's two aides, members of the Russian embassy, M. Fiquet, president of the chamber of deputies, M. Rlhot, minister of foreign affairs, M. Barbery, minister of marine, M. Dovellfi, minister of agriculture, and Generals Saussiere and Appert. A number of senators and members of the Chamber of Deputies were also present. The route from the duke's late residence to the Russian church was lined on both sides with troops and every window was filled with spectators. Hundreds of thousands of people are estimated to have crowded the streets near and through which the cortege passed. The presence of the French ministers, generals, senators, deputies, and troops at the ceremonies is looked upon as a mark of sympathy for France's possible ally in case of war.

The American Northwest Ravaged by Tempests and Snowstorms  
TOWN DESTROYED BY VIOLENCE  
A Steamer and Schooner Sunk Off the New Jersey Coast - No Trace of Their Crews  
St. Paul, Minn., February 8  
At noon today, snow began to fall in this city, and there has been the promise of a blizzard during this afternoon. The storm is pretty general in the Northwest, although North Dakota seems to have escaped to a considerable extent. A storm was reported at Minto, in the northeastern part of that state, last night, but there is said to be no storm at Grand Forks, Fargo, or Bismarck. In South Dakota, the storm that was raging at Rapid City has extended over the entire state. Aberdeen, Huron, Pierre, and other points report a very severe blizzard. A dispatch from Pierre says the worst blizzard since 1888 has been raging there since last night, with little prospect of cessation. The thermometer went as low as 20 below this morning, and it has been freezing all day.  

**A Gigantic Blizzard**  
At Huron, that snowstorm which has prevailed since midnight last was in progress at 6 o'clock tonight and had developed into a gigantic blizzard, almost equal in fury to that of January, 1888. It has raged all day, the wind blowing at a velocity of from thirty to forty miles an hour, driving the snow in blinding clouds and drifting it as high as the fence tops. The storm prevails throughout South Dakota and will probably interrupt railroading to a considerable extent. At 7 o'clock, the thermometer in this city was 24 below zero, but much colder weather is predicted for tomorrow. It was 15 below at St. Vincent, 18 below at Minne-dora, 4 below at Moorhead, 2 below at Bismarck, and 8 below at Fort Buford. The blizzard did not appear in North Dakota tonight, but is confined to South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, being severest in South Dakota.  

**Man Left to Tell the Tale**  
New York, February 7  
Another steamer is reported sunk almost on the spot where the Vizcaya went down a few months ago. The vessel is supposed to be the Norwegian-built steamer Simon Damols, which left this port Wednesday last for Matanzas, Cuba. As yet, nothing has been heard of any of the crew. They may have been lost or may have been rescued by some other vessel. The first tidings of a disaster were brought here today by Frank Kelly, a pilot on the boat Ambrose Snow. Kelly reports that on the 6th inst., he passed close to the wreck of a vessel with three masts standing about 20 feet above the water. The position of the vessel was in longitude 7.  

**1891-02-11:**  
"I have never heard of the stars in their courses fighting against me." Mr. Judge's declaration that, though a Liberal, he cannot support his party in its present policy has brought upon him the ire of the local Liberal organ. Mr. Judge will probably feel that he is in thoroughly good company alongside of Edward Blake. He is not supporting the party in its present policy either. There are a great many Blakes and Judges in the Liberal party this year. The announcement that five thousand people were present at the Bonsecours Market hall to hear Mr. Mercier speak on Monday night would allow a space of about half a square foot for each person. Nothing could indicate better the smallness of the average Canadian Grit. A New York prophet predicts that this year will be one of great tornadoes, blizzards, and cold waves. A combination of the three is due in Canada on the evening of the 5th of March. They are lucky who have fur coats. The Herald urges its party not to put a candidate in the field in Montreal West, where he would surely be beaten. The hits are on the run.

**The States Grain Market**  
Irwin, Green & Co.'s Chicago special to the Times says: "The current receipts of wheat constitute the enigma with which trade is wrestling. The estimates allow that 78.560 percent of the commercial surplus from the crop of last year has left the hands of the farmers in the first seven months, and the visible supply is a quarter less than at this date in 1890. The mild weather and perhaps the pressure for money may be advanced as explaining the freedom of movement now, and to this is added the fact that a considerable percentage of the daily receipts at St. Louis and Kansas City as well as in the Northwest come from the Pacific slope. So long as wheat comes out thus freely, speculative buying is not apt to be brisk except on the threat of a cold wave, and the market turns back when the cry of a 'blizzard' turns out a false alarm. The fact that selling from first hands is all the time less than the contemporaneous consumption, and strong cables from abroad have been counterweighted by the news of good rains on the California slope, that Russian ports are on the point of opening, and that shipments from India to the United Kingdom are slightly on the increase, the trade seems reconciled to the fact of light stocks here, which would certainly be cause for alarm in case of a scare about the crop for this year. But any such scare is not likely to occur before the latter part of next month, as it is generally understood that March weather is what determines the yield of wheat at the succeeding harvest time, and little importance is attached to the reports of a poor outlook at the moment for crops in Germany and Russia. We regard the situation in wheat as slowly strengthening, and it is bound to assert itself in the spring and early summer, the magnitude of the rise to be gauged by the prospect for the next harvest. If the market were a little less in control of the professional element, it could not stay down much longer. The floor operator looks askance at the record of failures in each of the several past years to sustain wheat long near the dollar mark, and this will probably act as a sufficient drag to hold it near the present level till the trade wakens up some morning to the conviction that the...

Outside is buying at a rate which cannot be resisted by the bear element. It is legitimate to expect that an impetus for this will come from abroad. Stocks of both wheat and flour at the leading points there are unusually low and are already recognized by some as being close to the danger mark, but of course they don't want to put their market upon themselves by admitting the truth. Besides, they have more than once found that quick steam transit helped them out when close to the point of exhaustion, and naturally hope the rule will hold good this time. But it is impossible to conceive of getting enough during the next six months without paying a great deal higher prices for the property. The corn market is comparatively steady, with rather less interest taken in it than heretofore. Advices from the country say stocks in many sections are good, with numerous full cribs, but are being drawn upon only to meet the current demand in market supplies, at which they are a trifle smaller than a week ago. It is said this corn will be marketed more freely when farmers get through sending in hogs, but the end of that process is not yet, and in the meanwhile cash demand here and at other points is about equal to the supply. An important feature of the market is the fact that we are about on an export basis, and foreigners are taking fair quantities, which they have hardly ever done before at anything like these prices. The circumstance shows that they want our corn and feel they must have it, the experience of many of them last winter for the first time having opened their eyes to its value as feeding stuff for livestock. Of course, there is no real reason for weakness in our market while this condition continues, but the feeling both with regard to corn and oats is very nervous, being born of the conviction that prices are too high for a healthy market, for which cause many stand ready to sell on the first signs of an important increase in the movement from interior points. They are all the more disposed to this as they know farm consumption has been unusually small, both because of the mild weather and for the reason that at relative prices it does not pay to put corn into pork in the West. This will make the summer supply much more liberal than might be expected from the size of the crop. Provisions have not settled in price so much as might have been thought, due to the excessive run of hogs and big stocks of product. They have been sustained by the country buying on the theory that a short corn crop always means dear pork, and packers are the principal shorts. A few days ago some longs got tired, but at the resulting decline in the market turned on active cornering, and it is evident the bears do not feel ever confident of their ability to send prices down much further. The product is not so much of a sale as it was a few weeks ago, but we should still recommend caution in buying except on extreme breaks. From all accounts, the stock of hogs in the country is still a big one, and holders are willing to sell rather than feed high-priced corn, but young stock is being drawn on too freely for the large summer supply. 

At New York, wheat closed at a further advance, 1c on the earlier options to 2c on the later, closing at $1.11 March, $1.06 May, $1.04 June, $1.00 July, 86c August, 86c September, 88c December. Corn closed at 63c February, 62.5c March, 60c May, 60c July, and oats at 52c February, 62.5c March, 61.5c May. At St. Louis, wheat closed steady, the later options gaining 1c. The closing prices were as follows: 86c-97c cash, 96c February, 96c March, 67.5c May, 88c July, 86c August. Corn closed at 60c cash, 60c February, 60c May, 50c July, and oats at 45c cash, 46c May. At Toledo, wheat was quiet and closed stronger at 1c advance at $1.00 cash, $1.01 May, 83c July, 80c August. Corn and oats were unchanged. At Duluth, wheat closed steady at 94c cash, 94.5c February, $1.00 May. 

Hot meats. 

At Chicago, the receipts were 10,432 flour, 21,000 wheat, 149,000 corn, 241,000 oats, 10,000 rye, 65,000 barley, and the shipments 16,267 flour, 49,000 wheat, 122,000 corn, 15,000 oats, 7,000 rye, 21,000 barley. At New York, the receipts were 12,324 barrels, 18,184 sacks flour, 88,200 wheat, 52,000 corn, 61,000 oats, 1,300 rye, 6,300 barley, and the shipments 3,187 barrels, 69,654 sacks flour, 11,570 wheat, 18,302 corn, 48,000 oats. At Milwaukee, the receipts were 12,070 flour, 18,000 wheat, 5,000 corn, 8,000 oats, 8,000 rye, 25,000 barley, and the shipments 37,450 flour, 3,000 wheat, 10,000 corn, 6,000 oats, 6,000 rye, 6,000 barley. At St. Louis, the receipts were 22,000 wheat, 77,000 corn, 33,000 oats, and the shipments 8,000 wheat, 68,000 corn, 10,000 oats. At Toledo, the receipts were 3,000 wheat, 31,000 corn, 1,000 oats, and the shipments 109,000 wheat, 32,000 corn, 1,000 oats. At Minneapolis, the receipts were 123,000 wheat, and the shipments 60,000. At Detroit, the receipts were 3,000 wheat, winter wheat prospects. The reports of the condition of winter wheat are generally good throughout the Ohio Valley states and the Southwest. Lack of sufficient moisture is the complaint in some parts of Missouri and Kansas. The promise on the Pacific coast is not of the best, and a great amount of moisture is required in the Northwest spring wheat states to assure a full crop. In Europe, unusual cold has done great damage to the uncovered plants, and in some parts of France farmers are preparing to resow their wheat fields. Russia reports serious damage by frosts, and in Asiatic countries there is nowhere a prospect of any more than an average crop. 

Local grain and flour. 

The local grain market continues quiet and without feature, the ruling quotations being as follows: No. 1 hard Manitoba, $0.00; No. 2 do, $1.00-$1.02; No. 3 do 90c-$1.02; No. 2 Northern, 91c-93c; feed do 60c-70c; peas, 75c per 66 pounds in store; Manitoba oats, 48c-58c; Upper Canada do, 48c-49c per 34 pounds; corn, 70c-77c, duty paid; feed barley, 50c; good malting do, 60c-65c; rye, 60c-62c. The flour market is steady and as we noted yesterday, a somewhat better feeling is noticeable, and although prices are nominally unchanged, some advance is anticipated in the near future. Local demand is for immediate wants, but it shows some signs of picking up; while in the case of export trading transactions occur occasionally, although as a general thing bids are below holders' ideas. Today we note sales of 1,480 sacks strong bakers at $5.00, and 900 sacks patent spring at $5.30. Recent sales on export account are also noted comprising 4,200 sacks patent spring, $6.30; $6.60 patent white; $6.34 straight roller, $4.60-$4.76; extra $4.10-$4.86; sunbrittle $3.75-$4.10; fine $3.30-$3.60; city strong bakers' $6.00-$6.00; strong bakers' $6.00-$6.00; sunbrittle bags $1.75-$1.90; extra, bus $1.30; fine bags $1.00-$1.10; glabral, standard, per bag $3.96-$3.30; oatmeal, rolled $3.40-$3.60. 

Receipts posted on 'Change today were as follows: 

1891-02-26: I.e. Lepine last evening it was as a May snowstorm is to a March blizzard. Five hot sounds and throats proclaimed the fact that Lepine was the coming man. The cheering could be heard away up St. Denis street, and every Liberal sneaking home from the poorly attended committee meeting held by the candidate of their party last evening heard them and went home convinced that their struggle was in vain and that the workingmen of the East end would only consent to be represented by a workingman in practice and not in theory. Mr. Lepine himself opened the ball. He was received with perfect ovation, such as is only accorded generally to the leader of a party. When it had subsided, Mr. Lepine, in clean, well-chosen language, briefly sketched his career as member of the House, showing that his vote and voice had always been on the side of the workingmen whose interests he had been elected to represent. He showed how the National policy had given them the remunerative labor they were now enjoying, and that its repeal meant ruin and disaster to the manufactories in which they were employed. He thanked them for the confidence they had in the past reposed in him and requested them to continue it by returning him once more at the head of the polls, a request that was met by a storm of applause, not one dissenting voice being heard. He was followed by Mr. 

1891-03-10: NI Sir Charles Dilke Anointed - Spain Sends Troops to Cuba - A Sketch of Marine Disasters. Dublin, March 9. Most Reverend Bartholomew Woodlock, Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise, who has been preaching at Athlone, exhorted his hearers to shun treasonable follies, as an immediate attempt was being made to entangle young men in the renewal of plottings which have been the curse of Ireland. He was grieved to have to state that certain Catholics of his diocese had broken into a meeting house while services were being held and had insulted and assaulted the minister who was conducting the services. The Bishop of Cork denounces the promoters of the proposed Parnellite meeting to be held in Cork on St. Patrick's Day. He says he will not administer to the needs of the souls of his people unless they protest against the desecration of the holiday, as the demonstration would be an insult to the great apostle of Ireland. The National Press says the upshot of the controversy over the Paris funds is that Parnell, after denying the title of the Nationalists to interfere, acknowledges their authority and awaits their judgment. The same paper asserts that the Irish National Federation is welcomed everywhere and becomes the heir of the defunct National League. The Nomination Offered to Dilke. London, March 9. At a meeting held today, the council of the Liberals of the Forest of Dean decided to invite Sir Charles Dilke to become the Liberal candidate for member of Parliament for that constituency, and said they felt confident of his moral integrity. Sir Charles spoke and said he had often announced his decision not to return to public life until he had cleared his character. No legal process existed by means of which he could prove a negative, but the vindication published in the pamphlet recently issued enabled him to prefer the troubles of a political life to the ease of a literary career. He would, therefore, consent to become a candidate if the constituency ratified the invitation which the council had extended to him. A Sketch of Marine Disaster. London, March 9. The steamer Strathendrick, from Cardiff for Kourabaya, collided with the steamer Devonshire at Bourabiya and sank in thirty-six fathoms of water. The engineer of the Strathendrick was drowned. The Devonshire was badly damaged. Here is the corrected text:

The Clan Mack while leaving Guile shuck on the rocks and filled with water. The steamer Salient, while on a voyage from Rotterdam for Houndoland, broke her shaft and drifted helplessly in a dense snowstorm.

Brussels, March 9. A dispatch from Madrid says the Spanish Government is about to dispatch 6,000 troops to Cuba on account of the increasing political agitation on the island. If the situation becomes worse, Gen. Campos will be appointed viceroy. The Spanish press protests against Americans encouraging the Cuban separatists in connection with the proposed treaty of commerce.

A Blizzard in England

London, March 9. A terrific blizzard prevails throughout the southwestern part of England. The storm is the severest on record in that section, and it is feared enormous damage has been done. Reports already received show that many small vessels have been wrecked off the coast. Hundreds of sheep and lambs have perished.

A for Pontiac, March 9. The diplomats and politicians are still discussing the visit of the Empress Frederick to Paris. Count von Münster, the German ambassador, attributes the moral check sustained by Germany to the influences of Baron de Mehrenheim, the Russian ambassador, whom the Count designates as an "old monkey."

Murdered Abyssinian Merchant

Horrific Incident at the Hippodrome

March 9. Beets, a noted lion tamer, was fatally mangled by an enraged lion at the Hippodrome today.

PRINCE JEROME DYING

His Death a Question of Few Hours—A Family Skeleton

In Opposition to the Church

March 9. The physicians in attendance upon Prince Jerome Napoleon have announced that both of the Prince's lungs are in a congested state, and they have informed the family that a fatal issue to his illness is only a question of a few hours. The Prince refuses the repeatedly proffered consolation and the administration of sacraments from the priests who have been called to his room. The sister of Prince Napoleon, the Princess Mathilda of Sandenata, learning of the presence of Madame Canisy at the Prince's bedside, refused to go to his room, though informed that her brother was dying. The refusal of the Princess explains the relation of Madame Canisy with Prince Jerome Napoleon. The members of his family, with the exception of Prince Victor, are hurrying to Rome. Prince Victor declines to make submission, which is the only condition on which his father consents to receive him. Cardinals Bonaparte and Mer-millod are in attendance upon the Prince, but they refrain from asking him to become reconciled with the church. Later, Prince Jerome is sinking fast. King Humbert and the members of the royal family are at the Prince's bedside. A silent crowd fills the street. Prince Victor had a touching interview with Princess Clothilde this evening and requested permission to see his father. The doctors, however, forbade an interview with the Prince, fearing it would excite him too much.

1891-03-11: ALL ROADS SNOW-BLOCKED

The Channel Almost Unnavigable

Life Savers and Fishermen Drowned

Mail and Telegraph Services Impeded

London, March 10. A snowstorm has been raging in Scotland and the north of England for a week past, while in the south of England the weather was mild until Sunday. Sunday’s gale, which was totally unexpected, advanced in a northeasterly direction across the Bay of Biscay. A blizzard prevailed over the whole of the south of England; it commenced in London at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The storm increased in fury at night, and there was an unusual rise of the tide. All the channel steamers had boisterous passages. Even in the harbors, the water was so rough that it was difficult to hold vessels to their moorings. The Dover mail boat nearly sank in the harbor; her paddle box was completely smashed. The mail service steamers cannot cross the channel. The sea makes a clean breach over the Admiralty pier, where the telegraph clerk and a signalman are practically prisoners. Similar reports come from points all along the coast. Throughout Great Britain, telegraphic communication is interrupted by the blizzard.

Railroads Completely Blocked

The railroads of Kent and Sussex are completely blocked, and the neighboring country is deep with snow. The hurricane which accompanied the snowstorm piled snowdrifts on all sides, stopping all traffic, railway lines, and country roads. Two trains full of passengers in the Midlands were snowed up last night, and the passengers were not rescued until this morning. The rescued people suffered terribly from cold during the night, owing to the unheated condition of the cars. A train on the North Kent railroad, bound for this city, was snowed up last night and still remains in the rail cut, where it was stopped by a drift. A number of engines have been sent to the scene, but they have been unable to move the train.

A Mail Car Lost

The Sheeuse's mail car cannot be found. It has been lost somewhere along the line of the railroad between this city and Sheerness. A searching party sent out after the missing mail car rescued the clerk. He was found half frozen in a snowdrift. Two clergymen were snowed up in a carriage on the Faversville road last night and were rescued with difficulty after having suffered severely. A for Pontiac was in town today and left for home this afternoon. The special committee appointed by the Council of Agriculture to meet two government veterinary surgeons in reference to the proposal of the latter to appoint seven deputies in various parts of the province met this afternoon and heard explanations from Drs. McEachran of Montreal and Couture of Quebec. These gentlemen strongly recommended the appointment of the deputies so that, in case of an outbreak of disease among cattle or horses in any part of the province, the farmers would be able to reach the government inspector at once. The committee, after a careful consideration of the matter, decided to recommend the appointment of seven deputies to the Council of Agriculture, which meets tomorrow. Dr. McEachran left for home tonight.

Homesteaders Perish in a Storm

Ashland, Wis., March 10. Sunday’s blizzard was the worst of the season. It was reported last night that two homesteaders on the newly opened land perished in the storm.

1891-03-13: A for Toronto, yesterday read a statement of the vote cast at the late provincial elections, which proves that the result was a popular condemnation of the Mowat administration. Though the Government has a large majority on the floor of the House, the votes in its favor placed at the polls were only 157,441, while those given for the Opposition candidates numbered 158,802. The Opposition majority among the electorate was 1,458.

Acquitted for Murder

Bancroft, March 11. The jury in the case of Thomas Pliass, who was charged with having murdered Prescott in December of last year, one Oscar Vancamp, and afterward placing the body on the railway track to be run over by a train and so hide the crime, returned a verdict late last night unanimously acquitting the prisoner.

THE BIG BLIZZARD DEAD

At least Seventy Lives Lost off the Coast of England

WHOLE CREWS DISOWNED

The Storm Breaks Out Afresh—All Roads Again Blocked—A Water Famine Feared at Plymouth

London, March 12. A foreign steamship, the name of which is unknown, was wrecked off Start Point, near Dartmouth, Devonshire, during the recent blizzard. All the crew and passengers were drowned. The British ship Dryand, Capt. Thomas, bound from Shields for Valparaiso, has also been wrecked off Start Point. Her crew, consisting of 24 men and officers, have been drowned. Among the schooners lost off Start Point was the Lannendale; four of her crew were drowned, but her captain was saved. The schooner Lizzie Ellen was also lost, and two of her crew were drowned. It is known that at least seventy lives have been lost off the coast during the blizzard, and in addition, at least ten men perished from cold and exposure after reaching the shore. It is feared the list of wrecks and the record of lives lost is far from complete, as several vessels are missing.

Many Points Still Isolated

Many points inland, where the storm was most severely felt, are still isolated from the surrounding country, and days must elapse before through freight and passenger traffic is entirely restored on the branch lines of the railroads. The severity of the storm and the difficulty of restoring the lines of communication to their usual state of usefulness may be judged from the fact that an express train which left Plymouth on Monday is still blocked up near the Brent River. The passengers are suffering from exposure. Gangs of laborers numbering hundreds have been sent from all directions to clear the railroad lines in Devonshire and Cornwall, where the snowdrifts have piled up so heavily that cuttings twelve feet deep have to be made through the snow, which is now frozen into an almost solid mass. The loss to farm stock is enormous and will entail much suffering among the farmers, who have already lost considerably by the terrible weather experienced at the end of last year.

Water Famine Threatened

The water mains at Plymouth are snowed up to such an extent that a force of 200 soldiers from the garrison has been sent to assist the waterworks employees in clearing them to an extent which will enable them to be used. No water has passed through the mains since Monday, and a water famine is now added to the other sufferings which the people of Plymouth have had to endure through the terrible blizzard which has caused so much distress in England. Following the blizzard, a severe frost has set in all over England. The frost is greatly hindering the clearing of the railroad lines which were blocked by snow drifts. Cornwall continues isolated from the rest of England. While a gang of men were working today on a train which had broken down on the Great Western Railway, they were run down by a relief train sent to the scene. Two men were killed and seven others fatally injured.

Lost Off the Welsh Coast

Cardiff, March 12. It is rumored at Newport that the steamer Trinidad has been lost and that all the crew have been drowned.

The Storm Again Sets In

London, March 13. Snowstorms have again set in in the west of England, and all roads and railways are again blocked.

**1891-03-17: THE STORM**  
During the present week, England has been excited by another kind of invasion. At last, these good islanders fancy that they know what an American blizzard, of which they have been reading for years, is really like. They don't want any more. The storm of Monday and Tuesday was, in truth, about an average rough winter snowstorm in the Middle States, but it threw Great Britain into literal consternation, and the train service in the provinces has not gotten right again yet. Great damage has been done to lambs and fruit in the southern counties, but it is not thought that the grain crops have been hurt very much. The price of wheat has advanced here during the week, more upon the immediate shortage of English supplies and reports of increased destruction of young crops throughout the northern belt of the Continent, where the storm wave was accompanied by greater cold and less snow. Today's news from Kiev that in some parts of southwestern Russia fully one half of the growing wheat crop is destroyed is the first real information about the Russian prospects we have had, and it fits rather gloomily with the tidings from Bengal.

**1891-03-25: MONTREAL WEDNESDAY MARCH 25, 1891**  
**THE LIVE STOCK TRADE**  
The British cattle markets maintain a steady feeling. The cold snap helped them. Both Birkenhead and Deptford benefited. Sheep and Scotch farmers—our trade hole (from our own correspondent)!  
March 14. A snowstorm of considerable intensity passed over the southern regions this week, interfering considerably with the supplies of many local markets. As regards trade, the cold snap has helped sellers out marvelously, both here and over in Birkenhead. The threatened congestion at London didn't amount to a row of pins (thanks probably to the aforesaid blizzard), and, beginning with a steady trade at 6d for good States beef, the week closes with a top quotation of nearly 7d current at Deptford. The moderate arrivals to Birkenhead, of course, enabled our salesmen to hold fast, and as the Central Meat Market had a good "redding up" on Monday, inquiries were coming in quickly all day Tuesday for lowest prices on London account. The result being that country buyers were bustled into paying 5d-3d, while the London men were filled at an eighth to a sixteenth less. Arrivals for the ensuing week are a trifle stronger, and while it is just possible, should the cold weather hold, the rates named will be sustained, I am inclined to think less money will have to be taken.  

**DELEGATES**  
That if in recent years much has been accomplished in removing false impressions and prejudices regarding the Dominion, there is still occasion for earnest and persistent effort directed to that end, is very clearly brought out by the reports of the tenant farmer delegates who visited Canada last year. Almost every one of them begins the record of his experiences by the avowal, expressed or implied, that in the British Isles much ignorance prevails as to the extent, resources, climate, and people of this country. "Until lately," writes Mr. George Brown, of Watten Mains, Caithness, Scotland, "Canada was believed by the majority of people in this country to be a land covered for nearly two-thirds of the year by snow and frost, with few and brief glimpses of sunshine during the remaining third, which was followed again by a covering of eternal snow; a land of ice and Indians, bears and blizzards, unfit for the abode of the Anglo-Saxon race, except upon the seaboards and in the vicinity of the great Lakes." If there are still among our old country compatriots (and doubtless there are) many persons who hold views concerning Canada so inconsistent with reality, the conscientious and impartial statements of Mr. Brown and his fellow delegates will correct their misconceptions and make any widespread ignorance on the subject without excuse hereafter. The idea of inviting representative agriculturists of England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, to come and see for themselves what Canada has to offer to the immigrant originated with the Hon. Mr. Carling, Minister of Agriculture, and was carried out with his usual judgment and vigor by our able High Commissioner at the metropolis. The selections seem to have been admirably made, and the reports now published by the Department of Agriculture for distribution in the United Kingdom contain a mass of multifarious information, obtained at first hand by intelligent and independent observers, which cannot fail to influence for their own advantage and cure the classes especially concerned. Our readers may recall that in the year 1876 a number of farmer delegates visited the older provinces and a considerable portion of new Canada, and that the results of their inquiries were published in a good-sized blue book, to which reference has frequently been made in our columns. During the interval between then and now, reports were also compiled by Professors Sheldon, Tanner, and Fream, who dealt exclusively with the agricultural capabilities of the Dominion. Several capitalists, manufacturers, and members of Parliament made the tour of Canada and, in pamphlets or magazines, have given the world their impressions of the country's resources. While some of these memorials have been widely circulated, others have reached but a limited number of readers. The reports just issued, which, if what I hear today, after twelve years of unexampled development, are...

**1891-03-26: A BIG KANSAS SNOWSTORM**  
Trains Stalled and Many Cattle Killed in the Blizzard  
**THE CASE OF THE SAVAGE WAR**  
The Alnuha Court Heard From  
A Mail Dog Panic  
Kansas City, March 25. Despatches from Kansas say the worst snowstorm of the season is raging in that state. The country from Eastern Kansas to Denver is covered with snow five to eighteen inches deep. A biting wind is whirling the snow into great drifts, and railroad tracks everywhere have disappeared from sight. A despatch from Atchison says the Central Branch division of the Missouri Pacific did not move a wheel today on account of the snow blockade. Several trains have been caught between stations, among them the pay train and a passenger train. The company with difficulty manages to provide crews and passengers with food. A snowplow was started out this afternoon, but as fast as it cleared a pathway, snow drifted in behind, and the attempt was abandoned, leaving the plow engine to "die" in the drift. Superintendent Rathbun says it is the greatest snowstorm the road has experienced in ten years. A despatch from Wichita says the Frisco passenger train is stuck in a drift near Bentley, and near Ellsworth a Union Pacific train is fast. There will be considerable loss to stock unless the snow disappears rapidly.  

**Nerd Distributor Allowed in Texas**  
Kansas, March 25. Reports received at the Rock Island General offices say that one of the worst snowstorms ever known in Northwestern and Southwestern Kansas is raging. The railway committee who went to the Northwest to distribute mill grain have wired that they are snowed in and must temporarily abandon the work.  

**A Dog Panic**  
To-day, so terrorized the residents that tonight the streets were deserted, except by men armed with revolvers, who were in search of the brutes. Early in the morning, Chief of Police Turnbull killed a dog which had bitten several others. Later, a man was bitten on the wrist in Tasealc Avenue and afterward killed the dog. In the afternoon, eighteen-year-old Mamie Exton was bitten on the hand after having a desperate ten minutes' battle with a mongrel dog. After this, another dog began snapping at pedestrians and was finally killed, and at night excitement was caused in Kearney by the rabid actions of a dog. Men patrolled the streets until late at night with revolvers, and the police were ordered to kill all stray dogs, as many are believed to have been bitten. The man and woman had their wounds cauterized.  

**Soldiers Suffer in a Blizzard**  
Omaha, Neb., March 25. Reports from all sections of the state show that the snowstorm today was very severe. In the southern part of the state, the snow is reported to be 18 inches deep on the level and drifting badly. The storm was almost a blizzard in the northwestern part of the state. Col. Henry and four troops of the Ninth Cavalry left Fort Robinson this afternoon from Pine Ridge. Many troopers were snow-blinded and exhausted from the long march during the storm. Railroad traffic is badly delayed, the most trouble being on the Burlington.  

**A Steamer's Perilous Trip**  
New York, March 25. The steamship Caledonian, which arrived here today from a Mediterranean port, had a very rough voyage. On the night of March 11, she struck a norther. A big sea was soon running, and before long the decks were swept by the waves. The wheelhouse was smashed and the helmsman injured. The sea also carried away the booby hatch and all the loose spars on the deck, and knocked down several Italian immigrants, injuring some of them severely. The second officer, who was on the bridge, was knocked off to the deck and badly hurt. On March 20 and 21, the Caledonian passed several icebergs far out of any hitherto reported. Nineteen of her crew were lost.  

**NORFOLK, VA., March 25**  
The steamer which went ashore a mile below Chicamacomico life-saving station, on the North Carolina coast, yesterday morning, is the British steamship Strathairly, bound from Santiago de Cuba for Baltimore. Out of a crew of twenty-six, nineteen were lost, including all the diners except the second mate. The steamer will be a total loss. The steamer was a British vessel of 1,236 tons. She was commanded by Captain Wylie. She left Baltimore February 23rd for Havana, where she arrived March 7th. She proceeded from Havana on the 13th for Santiago de Cuba, where she arrived on the 16th. She was on her homeward trip from Santiago to Baltimore when she went on the North Carolina coast with such fatal results.  

**The California Senatorial Bribery**  
Sacramento, Cal., March 25. The committee appointed to investigate the charge of bribery in connection with the finding of certain papers in the State library during the recent senatorial contest reported to the Senate last evening. They found that money came from the Southern Pacific Company, and that within sixteen hours after it arrived here it was in the State library, but who handled it there and for what purpose it was handled the committee could not determine.  

**Heavy Flood in Iowa**  
Des Moines, Ia., March 25. The Des Moines River has been rising rapidly, and with the large masses of outgoing ice is destroying much property. Several bridges above this place have been washed out and the timbers are floating down the stream, increasing the danger to city bridges. The belt line railroad bridge has been carried out. The Des Moines Union Railway bridge operated by the Wabash, Chicago, St. Paul, and Kansas City and other roads has been rendered useless.  

**Texas Sheriff Shot**  
Clarksville, Texas, March 25. Sheriff Whitman was killed last night while trying to arrest Sam Cookstone and others for theft.  

**Rio Grande City, Texas, March 25**  
Marcus Ortega, deputy sheriff, while trying to quell a disturbance at a dance last night, was fatally shot by Private Patrick Hogan, Troop C, Third Cavalry.

of every thousand; last week it was thirty-four and this week it will rise far above that. Since the beginning of the week the deaths have averaged over a hundred and fifty per day, the majority of them being due to the sudden changes in the climate. One peculiar feature of the situation is that scores of physicians are too ill to attend to their duties. All classes are attacked, and the death rate among those who are well fed, well clothed, and well cared for in every way is alarming. The undertakers are being rushed and the stock of coffins is being rapidly depleted. The fact that there is a coffin shortage leads many undertakers to believe that prices will soon be forced up, owing to the great demand not only from here, but the other cities in this section of the state as well. The Health Commissioner says that if people do not take better care of themselves the death rate will continue to grow right along, the weather at present being a great breeder of pneumonia.

United States grain market. At Chicago the grain market was strong today. Wheat opened firm and closed at a 1c advance at $1.05 May, $1.04 July. Corn was stiff all day but gathered strength towards the close, and closed at a 1c advance at 66c May, 65c July. Oats closed firm at a 1c advance at 65c May, 52c July. Irwin, Green & Co.'s Chicago special to the Gazette says: "The strength in wheat may be attributed to the advancing European markets. Cables being strong and higher on cargoes there was a better inquiry for cash wheat. One hundred and thirty-five thousand bushels are reported as having been worked for export there. Doubtless the weather also had a strengthening tendency, as low temperature and a blizzard prevail in the West and Northwest. Corn was fairly active and closed nearly 1c higher than yesterday. The buying was to a great extent based on wet weather which prevailed over the whole country. The receiving interest sold moderately early, but late bought considerably. The demand for cash continues strong. Although stocks of provisions were larger than the trade expected, the market opened steady at a small advance, and ruled quiet and firm during the day, closing, however, at dull or easier prices. The strength in corn did much to support the market, while heavy selling of lard by foreign houses was the chief element of weakness."

18910404: Wellington Canon, the new pastor of the Jefferson Avenue Presbyterian Church, will stop for the next few days at the Hotel Normandle. He will assume the responsibilities of his new charge today. When Mr. Carson was visited last night by a representative of the Free Press, he had just placed on the stand several fine photographs, among others those of Sir John A. Macdonald and Lady Macdonald. "Yes," said Mr. Carson, "I know Sir John well. I have known him for many years. For a long time he has been a member of my church. In his daily life, Sir John is one of the finest and most genial men in all Canada. He invests himself with a personal magnetism that attracts everyone to him, if not to his cause. I have often heard his rivals say, after an interview with Sir John, that they had better not become too intimate with the old man, or they might possibly be converted to his political faith. His personal magnetism is so great that everyone who comes within the circle of his influence is bound to become a friend of the great leader." "Are the people of Canada satisfied with the result of the recent election?" "Presumably, they are. As a matter of fact, both Liberals and Conservatives are filled with loyalty to the Canadian Government. The idea of any political policy shaking the patriotism of the Canadians is absurd. The cry of loyalty was taken up by Sir John and used with telling effect, but after all I think both parties are equally true to Canadian interests." "Then we shall never have Annexation?" "As that term is understood in the United States, I should say it will never come. The simple reason is found in the fact that there is no sentiment in favor of Annexation in Canada. This opposition to Annexation is found, as intimated before, in the loyalty of Canadians to the home government. For illustration, the eastern provinces are settled largely by Scotch and English. These people are still ardently attached to the home government. In Quebec, the Norman French or Roman Catholic element predominates. The great corporation of the Roman Catholic Church has its holdings under treaty stipulation. If Canada should be annexed to the United States, these great claims would be forfeited, or would in large degree be annulled. So you can see that Quebec is not anxious for Annexation. Thus the sentiment goes from province to province. The only people who really favor Annexation are the young men in some of the bolder towns. And even these supporters are not very numerous. Then again those whose business dealings bring them in contact with the union are anxious for Annexation, or at any rate for reciprocity. But you can set this down as an established fact: That there never was, nor is, nor perhaps ever will be, a sentiment in favor of Annexation." "And in regard to reciprocity?" "Canadians are beginning to see that they can get along without reciprocity. It was all right enough until along came the McKinley bill and placed a heavy duty on many articles whose natural market was in the United States. This was particularly true of eggs, barley, and horses. For eggs, we have since found another and an equally good market, Liverpool. We ship Canadian eggs across the sea and obtain good prices and a ready sale. No doubt, too, we will adjust things in regard to the other articles of export. So you see, we are not in a hurry for reciprocity in Canada." Mrs. Chas Smith of Jones, Ohio, writes: "I have used every remedy for sick headaches I could hear of for the past fifteen years, but Carter's Little Liver Pills did me more good than the rest." 

ETCHINGS: My Hippogriff has had a long rest since I turned him out on pasture. In case he might grow lazy, I will bridle and saddle him once more. While ransacking the antiquated ware of the past, I purchased a pillion for my Hierophant, and now that we are more comfortably equipped than heretofore, we may venture upon a hurried gallop over the mountains of the north off in the direction of the Aurora Borealis. I once before mentioned the fact that ours is a country free from earthquakes, volcanoes, pestilences, tornadoes, simoons, and other natural visitations that convulse, overwhelm, wither, devastate, or infect less favored regions. However, the people who live south of the great barrier of the Laurentians, in the valleys of the Ottawa or St. Lawrence, have little conception of a storm in the land of the moose and caribou. The blizzards of the Northwest are but child's play in comparison. These hurricanes never reach, in full force, the valleys or cities of the center; they are shattered into fragments by the mountain ranges, against which they dash in headlong fury and fall prostrate with the shock. My Hippogriff had carried me to an almost unknown spot by the Jean-de-Terre; my Hierophant had warned me of the near approach of one of those terrific storms. We took refuge in an old shanty by the side of a hill, and almost in the center of a pine grove of second growth. Timber had been made there twenty odd years before and all the indications of overgrowth on the main roads, underbrush around the fallen stable, mosses, and fungi on the logs of the shanty were there to tell of the scenes that once were enacted amidst the vast wilderness of trees. Uninviting as the shanty might seem, chill and bare as the camboose might be, yet it was our only refuge from the approaching danger. The sun went down in a red haze; and the stars one by one came out from their hiding places, and gazed down upon the scene of a coming strife. Calmly they appeared to contemplate the ravages of an approaching hurricane, like Infinite Power, sublime, tranquil, and omnipotent, looking upon the petty wars of man. How silent everything became! There was not a breath of wind to waft the smoke from our fire to one side or to the other. Lastly the smoke curled aloft, and appeared too weak to rise into the air. In a short time a loud and distant booming could be heard, a mighty noise like the roar and splash of giant floods. On it came, growing louder and louder. On it came, like the tide upon the Atlantic when its tempests lash the shores of the north. On it came, like the hurried march of a hundred thousand men, rushing to the destruction of a whole country. On it came, like the legions of Hyder Ali and Tipu Sahib, when they swept down upon the devoted plains of the Carnatic. The wind howled and hissed through the endless corridor of the forest; it raged and shrieked above and around the trees; it squealed in agony as it struck headlong upon a projecting rock. The giant of the North was on his march. The specter of the Arctic seas was approaching; white were his garments, like the shrouds of the dead; cold was his touch, like the embrace of the dead, and wild was his voice and hollow his tones, like the sepulchral cries of the dead. Down he came, and all things bent before him. He crushed the maple, the birch, and the poplar in his march; he grasped the dry pines and snapped them off and flung them upon the earth; he grappled with the living pine and shook them, as Sampson shook the pillars of the temple, until their lofty heads bowed, swayed, reeled in the blast of his breath; and, finally, he wound his arms about them and wrenched them by the very roots from the earth. Acres upon acres of forest were laid low; windfalls filled every open space for miles around. There the tempest of the north can be seen in all its fearful vigor. The partridges hid themselves away in a snowbank; the rabbits made for their burrows; the foxes crouched in their holes; and the majestic moose, forgetting their own dignity and their own strength in the presence of this dread giant of the skies, sought the shelter of some rocks in the lowland, and there trembled before the terror of the storm. How like the mighty and powerful of earth! Proud of their own strength and power, until the fearful hand of the unseen and more terrible power comes upon them. Exulting in their own vigor and independence, until the pent-up wrath of the Omnipotent is let loose, until the hand of death touches their frame and the trumpet-voice peals a note of warning in their ears! In half an hour the fury of the tempest was over, and going to the shanty door I gazed aloft. A slit in the clouds for a moment appeared, and through the rent I caught a glimpse of a solitary star that shone as bright and as calm as if no war of the elements had taken place. So like the rage and fury of political, moral, social, and physical strife here below, truth undiminished in splendor and unmoved in serenity, shines above all, and smiles upon the million combatants—fools that destroy each other for nothing, that crush each other for the sake of a moment's triumph and, finally, exhaust their effort and strength, and must still leave things as they found them. The storm passed on and left a track of desolation behind. Everywhere were the works of its rage; but, like the army of Sennacherib, its triumph was but transient. It is in vain to attempt, in English, to paint the majesty and power of a storm as it passes along the pine ridges of the North, leveling all before it with as much ease as the mower levels the hay. Perhaps had I the wild, weird imagery of Ossian, and a command of the glorious Celtic tongue, I might strive to give a word etching of such a scene. But otherwise all attempts must fail. It was not merely to see a storm that I invited the reader to take this short trip with me. However, like many other travelers in life, we had to meet with this momentary obstacle. We have no control of the elements, so we have, like other mortals, to pay for our pleasures by often encountering and enduring certain hardships. When the blizzard had disappeared southward, and rushed off scampering over the hills in all directions, like the detachments of a conquering army after victory, chasing and capturing, laying and pillaging the vanquished, we Hippogriff...

Uierophant and in; self started off in the wake of our thundering precursor. We swept swiftly southward over the Grand Lacs; thence southeast towards Seven League Lake, on the Coulonge; thence due south to the mouth of Victoria Creek; thence over Victoria Lake; past Fillion Lake, Dorion Lake, Lw a Tom, and finally we halted at Banger's old shanty upon a little track that flows into Beaver Lake, which latter is the source of the great east branch of the Black River. Along this creek, and sometimes over it, Caldwell's men had built their main road in the days when he lumbered there. The creek was "driven" sometime in the seventies. While making the improvements in the bed of the jam, a considerable amount of blasting was done, and one stone or chunk of rock, weighing about five hundred pounds, was dislodged. This curious rock is at the door of the little twelve-foot sapling or balsam shanty built by Banger, the trapper. There it is, and then it will remain until lumbering operations are recommenced, if ever they are, upon that part of the limit. To carry it otherwise, turn on some portage sleigh in winter would be impossible; the Indians have no use for it, and very likely in a few years old Banger's shanty, like himself, will be gone and forgotten. In rare sense, a reader might think I was inventing—or at least, drawing upon my imagination. I wish, before describing the peculiarity of the rock in question, to state that I visited the place in 1884 with Michol Lesort, of Pembroke, and old bushranger, Hon. Dieu "St Jean," of the Allumette Island. Both these men are alive and at their respective homes. In 1885, Pierre Miron, of the "Grand Marais," on the Black River, had otter, beaver, and mink traps set in the creek, and he and I went to hunt for any old trap that might have been hidden in Banger's shanty; the rock was there still. It was the late Mr. Sorensey, of "Fraser and Sorensey," who first spoke to me of it the year he was drowned. He had seen it, in one of his rambles, when agent for Capt. Young on the Coulonge, if I mistake not.

1891-05-14: Dairy Market. The Utica Herald of Tuesday has the following: Notwithstanding the disbelief expressed in New York concerning the amount of cheese disposed of at interior markets last week, the receipts in that city more than bear out the quotations of amounts given last Tuesday morning. Receipts are much larger than heretofore this season, enough so to give exporters the opportunity for which they have been looking to stand out against prices until they obtained a decided modification of them. Until Thursday, 11c stood as an outside quotation on best new cheese, but very little business was accomplished. Then the foreign buyers made a unanimous stand and refused to pay over 10c for anything whatever, and only allowed that on the best quality of white stock. The Bern trade did little better, as it always does, and paid 11½c for the special stock it wanted. But the exporters accomplished their object and obtained their goods at 10c and downward. Small light skims were in first-rate demand and sold well up toward the limit of large, full creams. In the latter, white stock has the preference at present. The experience of last spring, when the make of white cheese was largely overdone, made factorymen shy of producing it this spring, and the result is that just now it is a trifle scarce. Northern New York will soon restore the balance, however. The snow blizzard of a week ago this morning was succeeded by three or four days of quite cool weather, but without any rain worthy of mention. The ground is already very dry and is daily growing drier. A hot wave struck the country last Saturday, and under its influence, the foliage of trees has rapidly developed. Many dairies were turned out last week, and those that were not will be this week. Grass, however, needs rain in order to give it good growth. What there is of it is good in quality, but it is yet thin, and will not thicken up until considerable moisture has fallen. Still, there is enough to show its good effects on the milk, and probably what may be called "grass cheese" will begin to date from last Thursday or Friday. Three weeks from yesterday it will make its appearance on the market. This will be quite as early, probably a little earlier, than it appeared last year, but the full grass make will not begin to come forward earlier than four weeks from yesterday, or the second week in June. Butter retains a firm hold on prices and is quotable at higher figures than last week. Choice state creamery is worth 19c in New York, and even dairy stock has sold as high as 29c, although the general price for choice is 28c. These figures compare with 15c-18c a year ago and ought to be pretty satisfactory to dairymen. Receipts were taken up about as fast as they could be had in the market, and no surplus was left over. There is an increasing accumulation of evidence that milk is comparatively scarce even in the West, where grain is much more plentiful and cheap than it is in this state. And high-priced grain makes light yield of milk always, previous to turning the cows to pasture. Following is our usual comparative table of cheese quotations and receipts:

It is the highly digestible quality of the oyster that makes it so desirable as food and gives it the foremost place at feasts. Like Sir John Falstaff, who was not only witty himself, but the cause of wit to other men, the oyster is not only digestible itself, but it is also the cause of digestibility to others. They are recommended as a sovereign cure for the grippe, and they are good for old people when other food fails. They are equally good for young people and for the middle-aged, and for those who are neither young nor old. The cookery books devote five spaces to the precious bivalve and give many recipes for its kitchen treatment, but as the aphorism remarked, "the best way to cook an oyster is to eat him raw." — Chicago Herald.

English Sanitary Regulation. Sanitary regulations, both Imperial and local, are coming more and more to be based on the results of accurate scientific research into the causes of disease; philanthropists are working on the lines of sanitary reform; and, behind it all, there is the invaluable stimulus of the intelligent public, who have learned that there is at least a substratum of truth in the old adage that "health is wealth." And what is the result? Take this metropolis alone. In the ten years ending 1869, the inhabitants of London died at an average annual rate of twenty-four for every thousand living; in the ten years ending 1889, that rate was only twenty. In other words, over 17,000 lives were being annually saved in that decade in London; and the mortality is still far too great. The saving affected has been largely from the preventable diseases—a class of disease so especially fatal to men and women during the wage-earning period of life, a period when death casts upon the surviving public the onerous burden of supporting those whom it was the pride and happiness of the breadwinner himself to support. Besides which, prevention of these diseases means a diminution of preventable sickness, and this carries with it a lessening of domestic misery and an increase of individual vigor and happiness. It is no vain insular boast when we say that Great Britain stands first among the nations in this matter. The palm of preeminence has thus far been generally conceded to us, and we wish, if we can, to retain it. But we are being hardly pressed, and by none more closely than by our fellows, the English-speaking nations of both hemispheres. But in these days of rapid transit, the sanitary condition of any one nation is more than ever a matter of concern to its neighbors. This is especially exemplified in the matter of quarantine. It was long the universally recognized custom in the case of epidemics of cholera and plague to pretend to protect people from the incursion of these diseases by drawing imaginary lines around the populations. In fact, so-called cordons and quarantines instead of taking steps to provide a complete system of sanitary administration. We in this country have discovered that, if we give our seaports and our country generally an efficient sanitary administration and keep our towns clean, it is unnecessary in the presence of cholera to revert to an empty and antiquated form, which does untold harm by giving a feeling of false security, and which operates mischievously both in health and in commerce. Since this attitude was definitely adopted, we have in England and Wales spent nearly nine million sterling per annum upon measures for promoting public health and in removing the causes of disease. The result is that, while cholera, when imported, has gained no footing among us, hundreds of thousands of valuable lives have been spared, the remunerative capacity and the vigor of the people have been improved, and the costly item of preventable disease and death has undergone a diminution that could hardly have been anticipated. — Sir Douglas Galton in the Nineteenth Century. 

The Coming Winter. It is just as well to lay in a supply of coal and stove wood and warm funnels. Professor Foster, who is Iowa's weather prophet, says of the coming winter: It will be the coldest and most stormy, with the greatest snowstorms, especially deep and drifting snows, that has been experienced for many years. Cold weather with blizzards and drifting snows will begin early in October in the elevated region of Colorado and the Dakotas, and very cold weather, earlier than usual, will cover the states and territories of the Northwest and the Missouri River valleys. While the very deep snows that will fall and the numerous fierce storms that will occur, travel and transportation will be greatly impeded. About the middle of December, the weather will become warmer and average so till about the 1st of January, 1892, when the cold waves will come again and January and February will average colder than has been experienced in many years past. In effect, I have made these statements heretofore through the public press and in my lectures, and my reasons for making these predictions are based on identically the same causes as were my predictions that proved to be so accurate for the winter of 1890-91. — Chicago Tribune.

Achievement of the Commercial Cable. New York Evening Telegram. That the Commercial Cable Company is something other than an instrument for quick jobbing purposes and nobody has ever made that charge against it was demonstrated yesterday. The Commercial Cable lines saved the international business of Wall Street, and of the commercial exchanges of New York and other American cities, from paralysis. All other cable lines were disabled by the storm which raged on both sides of the Atlantic. Messages had to be withdrawn from the offices of the other lines and sent by the Commercial Cables. Thus, this company once again demonstrated the advantages which a well-built, strictly business-like enterprise has over its competitors. It has simply repeated its achievements of the time of the blizzard in March 1888, by saving two continents from the disasters of stoppage of international telegraph business. That the business public appreciates the advantages of a more modern plant, improved terminal facilities, and superior service, is shown by the fact that more than half of all the cable traffic between this country and Europe is handled by the Commercial Cable Company. That the stock of an enterprise so founded and so managed should have steadily advanced in the face of formidable assaults upon other financial values, is...

1891-11-24: MAY ALL BE DISMISSED. Regular consultations in the Nova Scotia contested mention (causes - Utility Centre) Prohibited, Halifax, November 23. There is a possibility of the petitions against the members for Antigonish, Pictou, Annapolis, Shelburne, Lunenburg, Cumberland, and Inverness being dismissed without going to trial. The petitions in the above cases were filed on the 27th day of April last. The law requires that cases of such a nature must be settled within six months. Six months, however, have elapsed, and the cases have not yet been disposed of. Mr. Ritchie, counsel for the respondents, signed on Saturday and today that the dates of bonds could not be fixed to the above cases because the specified term has expired and the petitions should virtually be dismissed. Mr. Congdon claimed that the reason the dates of the trial had not been fixed within the six months specified by law was owing to a stay of proceedings having been granted by the court; therefore, the time was legally extended. Mr. Ritchie contended that the stay of proceedings on the preliminary objections was granted by a full court, whereas the order staying the proceedings was granted only by a judge. The issue of the petitions remains pending from our own correspondent. 

Quesnel, November 23. The election petition against the sitting member in 'Utility Centre', Hon. F. Langille, was this morning dismissed, the attorneys for the petitioner declaring that they had no evidence to offer.

LOST IN THE BLIZZARD. 

The News Record, Northwest Prairie. 

Winnifred, November 23. The first deaths on the prairie this year are reported from Tisdale. A dispatch from which place today says: A sixteen-year-old son of L.B. Cochrane and a ten-year-old son of K. Walton, merchants of this place, whose ranches are just outside of town, were caught in Friday night's blizzard while looking for some cattle. The storm being so severe and so sudden, they were unable to find their way home that night, and searching parties organized the following morning found no trace of them until last night. The Cochrane boy was found sixteen miles from home, frozen to death beside a haystack, his shirt eating hay over his dead body. The police are now scouring the country for the other boy. The wheat receipts at all provincial points continue very large, and good prices are paid. As high as 65 cents is paid for front wheat, which is very satisfactory. Railroad work in Manitoba has been impeded for the season, frost having taken too much hold of the ground. It was eighteen below zero this morning, which is the coldest of the season. General Superintendent Wbyte will shortly go to Calgary to consult with the city council regarding the shipping of cattle from that point over the Canadian Pacific to the Pacific coast. It is thought better and more profitable trade can be developed in shipping carcasses than in sending the cattle on the hoof. The provincial elections will be brought on very shortly, according to rumor. The city council will on Wednesday open proposals for Winnipeg's greatest scheme, the development of the Assiniboine River's water power for manufacturing purposes.

On all railroads in the state were seriously retarded, and in many cases along the western division of the Union Pacific trains were blockaded. The farmers feel partly compensated for the loss of their stock in the fact of having their winter wheat well protected. The term extended throughout Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. In Wyoming, the loss of stock is reported annually large, with a complete train blockade. Portland, Ore., December 28.

MADE INSANE BY FAMINE

A famished Russian peasant's crime. Prisoners doomed to despair. St. Petersburg, December 26. A famished peasant in the Tcheliabinsk district killed five men recently for the purpose of robbing them and buying food with the money obtained. He was arrested while hiding the bodies. He told the prosecutor he murdered the men while they were sleeping and that he only got four roubles. The prisoner seemed to have been driven insane by excessive hunger and cold. The prison at Samara, which was built to hold 200 inmates, is now crowded with thousands of unfortunates, among whom dysentery and typhoid fever are rife. The doctors, whose duty it is to attend sick prisoners, are in despair and have not visited their charges for a month. A rapid increase in the number of deaths, due to the famine, is reported to the authorities here.

The Minister of Finance has issued a report regarding the condition of the winter wheat crop recently sown. According to this report, the condition is satisfactory in the whole of the Russian provinces in Central Asia, including many of the panic-stricken districts in Northern Russia, and in the Crimea this crop is in a medium condition, while in Southern Russia, below the latitude of 42 degrees, it is unsatisfactory.

18920108: The Khedive's Bold Should Tighten

The Times, in commenting on the death of the Khedive, says that the accession of a youthful ruler affords a good reason why England should have a tighter hold on Egypt. The Standard says: "Should the Sultan consider the time opportune to reopen negotiations, he will find that while we entertain a punctilious respect for his suzerain rights, we cannot expose both him and Egypt to a repetition of the dangers from which England alone rescued them." The Dictionnaire de la République of Paris, foreseeing that arguments like the foregoing would be advanced by the British, demands that the powers combine to prevent the placing of Abbas Pasha under English tutelage.

The Khedive's Career

Tewfik Pasha (Mohammed Tewfik), Khedive of Egypt, was born November 10, 1852, being the eldest son of the late Khedive Ismail. He succeeded to the Vice-royalty of Egypt by a decree of the Ottoman Empire, August 8, 1879, upon the joint abdication of his father, and received the investiture on August 14. He was the sixth ruler of Egypt in the dynasty of Mohammed Ali Pasha, who was appointed vail or governor in 1806, and who in 1841 got the Sultan, with the five great powers of Europe, to settle the hereditary principality in his own family. He was succeeded in 1848 by his son, Ibrahim Pasha, who lived just two months after his elevation. The next ruler, Abbas Pasha, a son of Mohammed Ali's second son, reigned six years. In 1854 he was strangled. Said Pasha, a third son of Mohammed Ali, succeeded on the death of Abbas; but Said also "died" in 1863, whereupon his nephew, Ismail Pasha, the second son of Ibrahim, became ruler in his turn. In 1888 the law of succession was altered from that which had been established in 1841. Instead of succession devolving, as heretofore, according to the usual principles of Mohammedan law, upon the senior male descendant of the founder of the dynasty, it was to go to Ismail's eldest son, and thenceforth in the same order of primogeniture, excluding the other branches of Mohammed Ali's family. The consequence of this arrangement was the accession of Tewfik in 1879, instead of Halim, the fourth son of Mohammed Ali. Prince Tewfik was president of the council at the time of the coup d'état of his father, but resigned the post immediately afterwards. In September 1881, Arabi Pasha appeared at the head of a military and popular revolt, compelling Tewfik Pasha to dismiss his former ministry and to convene a sort of Parliament called the Assembly of Notables, which met about the beginning of 1882. Arabi was appointed under-secretary for the War Department and was raised to the rank of Pasha. The Khedive was forced to accept a National ministry, and the Organic Law, adopted in defiance of the protests of the Controllers, placed the Budget in the hands of the Notables, thus subverting the authority of England and France embodied in the Control. Arabi, now substantially dictator, and supported almost universally by the Sultan, proceeded to more daring measures. Eventually, the English Government felt obliged to intervene by armed force. Then followed the bombardment of Alexandria by the fleet under the command of Sir Beauchamp Seymour (July 11, 1882), and subsequently (September 13), the decisive defeat of Arabi and his army at Tel-el-Kebir by the British troops under Sir Garnet Wolseley. Arabi and his lieutenant, Toulba Pasha, fled to Cairo, where they surrendered to General Drury Lowe. He was condemned to death, but the sentence was commuted by the Khedive to perpetual exile from Egypt and its dependencies. Ceylon having been chosen as the place of banishment, Arabi, with other leaders in the rebellion, were taken to Colombo where he died, September 6, 1884. After the banishment of Arabi, Tewfik acted in close harmony with England. He was a loyal and, as Egyptian rulers go, an honest man. He was neither cruel, vicious, nor extravagant, nor was he an intriguer. He married, in 1873, Princess Emineh, daughter of the late El Hami Pasha, and had two sons and two daughters. One of the sons, Prince Abbas Pasha, born July 14, 1874, succeeds him.

The Tuaregs with the French

London, January 7. Advices from Tangier state that the Moorish mission sent to Fez in order to arrange for the formal annexation of the Oasis to Morocco failed to accomplish their object. The Tuaregs told the Moorish envoys that they had reconsidered their desire to have the Sultan of Morocco as their protector and that they now preferred to form a connection with Algeria, in other words, with the French. When the envoys returned and reported this failure to the Sultan, the latter was greatly infuriated. The envoys were thrown into prison and subsequently, by the Sultan's orders, they were strangled.

Italy Doesn't Like the Zollverein

London, January 7. The Rome correspondent of the Times says: "Strong opposition is manifested throughout the country to the Zollverein, in which it is now seen that farming interests are sacrificed to benefit a few manufactories in the north. The Italian Cabinet is divided on the Government's commercial policy. Premier Rudini is trying to resist the overwhelming protectionism, but the influence of the Lombard manufacturers in Parliament is so great that a commercial rupture with Switzerland is likely."

A BLAZE AT ARGENTEUIL

Bodinque, proprietor, and in a short time the hotel was enveloped in flames, which also reached the outbuildings. Before 6 o'clock the hotel and buildings were in ashes. Part of the stock of liquors in the bar room was saved, as was also some of the furniture. Here is the corrected text:

6, 1838 II made his theological studies partly in his native country and partly in Rome, with great success. After his return from Rome, he was professor in the College of Fribourg, and then studied philosophy and theology. When the Jesuits were driven from Switzerland, he came to America and finished his studies in St. Louis, Mo. His first place as a ministry was Green Bay, Wis. In 1851 he returned to Europe, and after having undergone the last probation in Tionchtomea, Belgium, he was employed in giving missions in Germany, where he proved to be an excellent preacher. But, on account of his failing health, he was soon removed from missionary work and appointed rector of the College of Cologne and Paderborn. In 1869 he became provincial of the German province and remained in this office for six years. Then he was appointed professor of moral theology in the College of Maria-Laach, and in 1899 rector of that college, whence he was called to Rome to be assistant of the General for the provinces of Germany, Galicia, Austria, Belgium, and Holland, and the missions belonging to this province in North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Australia. He was an able theologian and excellent linguist, and had great experience in administration, to lay nothing of the excellent qualities of his character. Hence he was, in every respect, the right man as successor of Pope Becks. Father Anderledy was one of the cleverest and most adroit superiors the society has ever had. He was a Jesuit for fifty years, yet he was much more a man of the world than a priest. A born diplomatist, he knew how to commence an intrigue by the most innocent agents, and how, without any seeming interference, to check it when it was going too far or in the wrong direction. He was a man of polished manners and an sociable temper; among his many accomplishments, not the least was his knowledge of languages. He spoke with remarkable ease and fluency French, Italian, German, Spanish, and English. Father Anderledy was very prominent in the Ultramontane league agitation in 1847, and shortly after the league came to an untimely end, he was appointed superior of the province of Prussia. His acquaintance with the political and religious situation in the German-speaking countries, which had before been extensive, rapidly increased, and he was promoted to the high post of "Assistant for Germany," with jurisdiction over Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, and Scandinavia. There are only some half-dozen of these "assistants" to the superior, and the appointments are always for life, although the general assembly of the society has the power to dismiss them, a power most rarely used. Father Anderledy's long connection with Germany had an important influence upon negotiations between Berlin and the Vatican.

New York State Canal Tonnage Albany, January 18. The whole number of tons of freight carried upon the canals of this state during the season of navigation was 4,563,472 tons and was composed of the following described classes of articles: Product of the forest, 1,206,986; agricultural, 1,171,192; manufactures, 109,387; merchandise, 250,093; other articles, 1,625,826.

Comparing the tonnage of 1891 with that of 1890, there is shown to be a loss of 682,830 tons. But during the year 1890, much ice was transported upon the canal, so that the loss this year as compared with the tonnage of last year, exclusive of the ice, is 215,093 tons.

A Startling Arkansas Lynching Fort Smith, Ark., January 18. United States Marshal Liggett has just come in from the northern part of the state, where he has been chasing moonshiners, and reports a double lynching which occurred recently in the mountains. Peter Baker, a farmer, was found murdered in his house. His wife and a man named Johnson left the country, but both returned a few days ago. The neighbors suspected them of putting Baker out of the way. An assault was at once made on the house, and the couple was captured. They were lashed together, back to back, and then hanged on the same limb with the same rope.

Silver City, N.M., January 18. A Mexican named Juan Lopez, living on a ranch northwest of this place, four years ago caught a young mountain lion and raised it as a pet. He had the animal completely under subjugation, and it was as docile with him as a house cat. Lopez was recently married, and the lion took a dislike to his wife. During the man's absence last week, the animal attacked Mrs. Lopez and tore her to pieces. He then fled to the mountains. Lopez has become insane with grief.

A Cleveland Primary Victory New York, January 19. A dispatch to the "Inquirer" from Philadelphia says: "A sweeping victory was won by the Cleveland and Paulson forces at the Democratic Primaries here last night.

Philadelphia sends 35 delegates to the state convention under the new apportionment, and thus will have the balance of power in that body."

18920225: "M. Lion Esquime, a French-Moslem savant, is said to have perfected recently a marvelous instrument for photographing speech. By speaking into a photophone transmitter which consists of a highly polished diaphragm reflecting a ray of light, the ray of light itself is set into rapid vibrations, and a photograph is made of the sound of the voice as it travels along a band of sensitized paper. Now comes the wonderful part of the story: if the image of the photographic tracing is projected by means of an electric arc or oxyhydrogen light upon a selenium receiver, the original speech is instantly emitted from the tube of the receiver, and may be heard as plainly as if uttered by a human being in an ordinary tone of voice. It is true, this is a most wonderful discovery, as it is evident that there is no limit to the development of this peculiar combination of methods. There is one curious thing about a Russian winter: in the latter part of October or the first of November, the weather will be as mild as it is here in September. Not a sign can be seen of an approaching change, when suddenly, without an apparent warning, a light haze will be seen in the northern sky, and in 12 hours the thermometer may fall 50 degrees. The change is so sudden and violent that travelers are frequently frozen to death before they can gain shelter. It has occurred that farmers, out looking after their flocks, have been caught in one of these blizzards, and, missing their way home, have lost their lives, their bodies remaining under the snow until the following spring. The suddenness of a Dakota blizzard is well known in the northwestern part of our country, but it is tardiness personified when compared with the rapidity with which a Russian winter storm comes.

FROM TORONTO: A Benefit Association In Trouble. Man-itary Reform: Trifling with the Temperance Question. (From our own correspondent) Toronto, March 4 - The Massachusetts Benefit Association of Boston, an insurance concern doing business here, was charged in the Police Court today with unlawfully neglecting to have the words "Assessment system" printed in every advertisement issued and used in Canada in connection with their business. Efforts are being made to secure the closing of all privy vaults and cesspools and the proper drainage of all privies within the city limits. To enable property owners to do this, it is proposed by Alderman Lamb that the City Council should seek authority to issue debentures to be called "sanitary improvement debentures," and that amounts be advanced for sanitary purposes and charged against the property as a local improvement. The estimates of the Police Department were submitted by Chief Grissett today. The amount asked for this year's police protection is $121,275.50, an increase of $11,010 over last year. Mr. Meredith, in the local House this afternoon, charged the Government with trifling with the temperance question and asked for an order of the House for a return of copies of the case submitted for the opinion of the Court of Appeals as to the validity of the local option provision of the Municipal Act, and of the opinions of the Judges of the said court therein and of the judgment pronounced by the court in the premises.

Halifax, March 4 - The steamer Conscript, which arrived at noon today from St. John's, Nfld., brought the following additional particulars regarding the dreadful calamity at Trinity Bay by which so many sealers lost their lives: Trinity, March 1 - The Hosecleer returned this morning, bringing sixteen of the men reported from Heart's Content yesterday, and the bodies of John Penney and Solomon Penny, found in boats. The sixteen men, all of English Harbor, except Patrick Hanlon and three sons, got on a pan of ice seven feet high Saturday night and made a shelter with some of their boats and a fire of others and three seals which they had. The ice drifted into Heart's Delight Sunday morning and they walked ashore. One young fellow was frozen stiff when they made the fire, but he revived. These sixteen are well, but William Kavanagh and his four sons are at Shoal Harbor, on the south side of the bay, just beaten. They could not board the craft. Captain Foolow saw fires in the direction of Norman's Cove on Sunday night, but it was impossible to get there, where it is hoped more missing men are. Eleven are still missing. The following are the names of the dead as far as ascertained: John Penney, Tobias Penney, Martin Bullion, Solomon Penney, English Harbor; Edward Pottle, Charles Day, John Nurse, Salmon Cove; William Stockley and Jesse Butler, Robinhood; Robert Bannister and Charles Bannister, Ship Cove; William Barnes, English Harbor. The Evening Herald of Tuesday says: "At first it was feared that over 200 people were cast away, but we are thankful to say, as far as we can learn, there are only eleven now missing, and thirteen have died, making a total of twenty-four fathers and brothers who have succumbed to the blizzard of Saturday night." The men still missing are: Isaac Batson, William Batson, Arthur Bauson, Reuben Pottle, of English Harbor; Henry Nurse, George Nurse, Charles Nurse, and William Nurse, Salmon Cove; John Moore, George Moore, and Jacob Moore, Trinity South.

FAIR WEATHER: Promised for Today, With Higher Temperature and Westerly Winds. Toronto, March 4, 11 p.m. The storm over the Maritime provinces is abating and is moving northward.

18920310: I (Mo) N, Neb., March 9 - Charles Warning, who was fined by Acting Judge Horacelette on Saturday morning, entered the courtroom today and attempted to murder him, firing two shots at him as he sat in his courtroom. The first shot took effect in the region of the heart, but was turned from its course by some articles in the vest pocket; the second bullet struck the judge over the left eye and ploughed through the flesh in an upward direction. Warning was locked up. It is not believed that the judge's injuries are fatal. 

Ontario and Western's New Step. New York, March 10 - The Tribune says: "An important step has been taken by the directors of the New York, Ontario, and Western Railway, looking toward the development of the property and the improvement of its finances. A meeting of stockholders has been called for April 20th. It is proposed to create a mortgage of $20,000,000, the bonds to be payable in gold, to run for 100 years and to carry 4 percent interest." 

A Blizzard in Minnesota. Minneapolis, March 9 - The city is now in the storm center of the worst blizzard that has been seen in the Northwest in four years. 

A VERY SANGUINE VIEW. Mr. Thompson Makes a Prophecy Regarding Motor Power. The Balmoral Hotel last evening was the scene where the Montreal (No. 1) section of the Canadian Association of Stationary Engineers met at a dinner, which was all that an epicure could ask for and reflected great credit on Mr. 

Prices: Strong bakers, 6 2/1; A 40; 4 6/0; 4 70; 4 2/0; 4 60; 6 00; 11 0 00; 4 00; 4 00. Oatmeal is quiet and easy. Business is about the same. Bran and shorts are in some demand at $10-$17 and $17-$18 respectively. Moulting is dull at $14 with nothing doing. Wheat is purely nominal on spot, with nothing on which to base annotation. In Ontario, the tendency is easy, but the strong basis of Manitoba wheat is fully maintained at primary markets, sales of No. 1 hard occurring today at 10 1/2. Reports indicate fair receipts, but there is a blizzard on today in the Northwest, which may have an effect on them. Barley has a very slow sale, and prices rule unchanged, an occasional feed stock moving at 40-42c. Oats remain dull, with a mere jobbing business doing at 32-33c per 34 nominal. Corn 60-62c duty paid; food barley, 42c-43c; good malting, 60c. At Chicago, wheat opened at a 1c advance at 89c. May sold off 1c but recovered and closed at 90c, the highest point of the day, and 1c above yesterday's closing quotation. Corn closed steady at 42-20 May, and oats were rather stronger, closing at 31-3/4c May. Messrs. Oswald Bros. 13 and 15 Hospital. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

Irwin, Green & Co.'s Chicago special to the Gazette says: "Wheat opened somewhat excited and higher on very cold weather in the Northwest, amounting to a blizzard in Dakota, with every prospect of much lower temperature further south to-morrow. English cables were higher. The miscellaneous smaller shorts covered, after which the market was dull with a drooping tendency, caused by reports that exporters were selling in New York and strenuous efforts by larger shorts to keep the market down. Notwithstanding this, and lower continental cables, the market closed firm at nearly the top. If the cold wave works eastward without getting further south, the tendency will be toward lower prices, as considerable local buying was based on severe weather to-morrow. The absolute prohibition of the privileges of trading by the board will doubtless result in a wider daily range. Corn was exceedingly dull, and the general tone inclined to weakness, but the strength in wheat checked the decline. The country bought moderately on the cold weather, while the offerings came principally from local traders. There was slight improvement in the cash enquiry. Provisions ruled dull and heavy in the early part of the session, but firmer later. Very little was done on outside account, the trading being confined to packers and home speculators. At the stockyards, 32,000 hogs were expected for to-morrow, and prices ruled lower.

On account of the fire in the Great North Western Telegraph office this morning, the "ticker" service was not very good to-day, and we are without our usual closing quotations of the grain markets. Peerbohm's cable to-day says: Cargoes off coast, wheat and corn, all cargoes on passage and for shipment, wheat slightly better; corn, there is a demand for cargoes near at hand, while there is not much enquiry for more distant periods of delivery. Liverpool spot wheat, quiet; corn do firm. Liverpool mixed maize, 4s 8d; Canadian peas, 6s 2d. Weather in England milder. Mark Lane English and foreign wheat "quiet; do American maize steady; do Languedoc maize, quiet; do English and American flour, slow. No. 2 Club Calcutta wheat, ex-ship, 35s 0d; present and following month, 30s 0d.

London, March 7. The Mark Lane Express, in its weekly review of the British grain trade, says: English wheats were steady. Foreign wheats made a fractional advance, Californian being 6d dearer and American red winter 3d dearer. Barley was weak, the provincial markets quoting American 6d lower. Oats were firm; there was a rise of 1d in prices with a reduced sale at the advance; corn went up 3d; new American on passage was quoted at 20s 6d. The market for oats was steady; American was quoted at 18s 6d. At to-day's markets there was a better enquiry for English wheats at full prices, while foreign wheats were neglected. English flour was 1d cheaper and American flour 1d cheaper. Corn and oats were 3d dearer. Beans and peas were steady.

**Movements of Grain and Flour**  
At Chicago, the receipts were 62,217 flour, 157,000 wheat, 203,000 corn, 28,000 oats, 18,000 rye, 31,000 barley, and the shipments 25,701 flour, 31,000 wheat, 124,000 corn, 208,000 oats, 22,000 rye, 32,000 barley. At New York, the receipts were 15,000 brls, 12,417 sacks flour, 70,500 wheat, 101,075 corn, 58,425 oats, 14,745 rye, 8,250 barley, and the shipments 1,314 brls, 22,523 sacks flour, 48,381 wheat, 104,431 corn, 5,202 oats, 10,000 barley. At Milwaukee, the receipts were 5,250 flour, 3,000 corn, 12,500 oats, 3,000 rye, 37,000 barley, and the shipments 18,800 flour, 22,000 oats, 5,000 rye, 1,800 barley. At St. Louis, the receipts were 27,000 wheat, 10,000 corn, 10,000 oats, and the news of this Northwest.

**Gold Found Near Portage**  
A blizzard at Winnipeg—the grain market. Winnipeg, March 9. An explorer named Benson has brought into Fort Portage samples of gold discovered near there which have set the town wild with excitement. Experts say the samples will run $25,000 to the ton. The Manitoba Legislature opens tomorrow afternoon. This is the last session of this Parliament and some exciting times are expected when Mr. Greenway springs his Redistribution bill. Winnipeg was struck by a blizzard last night, but as the temperature did not fall to any extent, no one suffered very much. There are snowdrifts today as high as houses, and the streetcars had to be taken off the routes. There is considerable difficulty running trains. At the close of the present session of the Manitoba legislature, the Conservatives intend holding a big convention here to organize for the approaching campaign. A bitter contest is expected, the separate school question being the main issue. The magnificent work done by the Pacific Railway Telegraph company in collecting Quebec election returns is highly praised by the provincial papers. Half an hour after the close of the polls, the first returns began to arrive here. About 200 cars of wheat of excellent quality were inspected at this point during the past week. At the annual meeting of the Manitoba Pacific Association yesterday, the following officers were elected: Patron, Sir Donald A. Smith; vice-presidents, Lieut. Governor Schultz, Wm. Whyte, J. T. Kturmam.

**The Cratan Company**  
A JILOW IN RETURN. Sir Charles Tupper's significant words at the Commerce dinner on the British Bill. London, March 10. At the Chamber of Commerce dinner last night, Sir Charles Tupper responded to the toast "Canada, her Commercial Relations." He said Canadian manufacturers and exporters were marching under the hardships of the McKinley tariff, and it would not be long before the people would show their loyalty to the integrity of the British Empire by striking the United States a blow in return for her present policy. Canada prevented Boston and New York from booming (commercial capitals), and with the aid of the home government, she could still further encroach upon the prestige of those cities and make one of her seaports the greatest outlet in the world for grain. Canada had the soil and the willingness to accomplish those results and the time was ripe when she should receive an opportunity to show the capabilities of her territory and people.

**A Frightful Blizzard**  
The worst storm in years sweeps over the Northwestern States; great damage done. Chicago, March 10. A frightful winter blizzard from Lake Michigan to Montana, the worst in years and unexampled, raged last night. Fifty degrees fall in temperature, a whirling cyclone of snow and sleet, and reports from all sides of destruction to property and life are the features of the extraordinary visitation. Individual cases are given of people freezing to death. All trains are delayed, says a dispatch from Dubuque; the wind is blowing at a forty-five mile rate, with the mercury at zero and rapidly descending. At Waterloo, Iowa, many cars along the Illinois Central railroad are reported blown from the track. The roof of the Ketchum wagon works in Marshalltown was lifted away by the gale. From nearly every place heard from come details of damage aggregating many thousands of dollars from the wreckage of fencing, mill towers, factory smokestacks, plate glass windows, trees, chimneys, signs, and out-buildings. From oppressive warmth Tuesday night, the change in Chicago last evening was remarkable, ice and gale making havoc with street traffic and greatly embarrassing electric communication. A building in course of erection in Chicago was blown down and two workmen were fatally injured.

**Blazing in the Storm**  
Br. Paci, Minn., March 10. Several school children who started for school yesterday morning and two teamsters who drove into the country are missing, and it is feared they are victims of the blizzard. Br. Minn., March 10. At West Duluth yesterday, the smokestack of Merrills & King's saw-mill blew down, killing F. Cullen and injuring two others. It is feared there will be much suffering if not loss of life before the storm is over. 

**Temperature Drops to Zero**  
St. Paul, March 10. After raging with terrific fury for thirty-four hours, the blizzard passed on to the northeast, leaving in its wake intense cold, the mercury early this morning reaching 10 below. As fuller details of the storm are received, it grows in magnitude and intensity, and fears are expressed that there may be greater loss of life. On account of the bad shape the wires are in and the drift-covered country roads, the full details of the loss of life will be slow in coming in, but that there have been serious results from this storm is undoubtedly true. Damage to property from the severity of the gale is reported very great at Fargo, Crookston, and other places. So far as the railroads were concerned, the gale and blizzard got in their deadly work last night when it blew and drifted the snow badly. Snow ploughs are out on every division, while several trains have been annulled and others are coming in slowly. A snow plough carrying two engines and running as the first section of the regular train had a head-on collision at Lake Park this morning with the first section of the passenger train. George Carrier, engineer of the passenger train, was seriously injured.

On favorable legislative action in New Jersey toward the Reading combination, exports of wheat (and of flour and wheat) from the coasts of the United States for the six days ended March 10, equal 3,754,000 bushels, against 208,000 bushels the week before. The Agricultural Bureau report indicates that the United States will carry over 72,000,000 bushels of wheat visible and available July 1, 1892, even should we export 50,000 bushels in four months preceding that date against a total surplus July 1, 1891, amounting to about 32,000,000 bushels. An improvement is noted in general trade in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. In both, there is a moderately active demand for staple goods, sugar being higher. Demand for wheat is not heavy. An early opening of navigation is expected at Montreal, where there is already considerable demand for ocean freights. Bank clearings at four Canadian cities equal $18,520,856, an increase of 6 percent during the week. There were 40 failures in the Dominion reported to Bradstreet this week, against 33 last week and 479 January 1 to date, against 403 in a like share of 1891.

METAL MARKET

London, March 6. The market for pig iron warrants has been irregular, with a very fair business in English sorts, but only moderate movement in Scotch and Hematites. Scotch prices have stood at about 40s 3d; those for Cleveland averaged somewhat lower at 35s 3d-35s 7d, and Hematites receded to 45s 4½d. Some speculative interest has been aroused by anticipation of a rise in price of coal and an increase of cost of production, but that has died out the past few days and the market at present is flat. Consumptive demand is moderate and export movement spiritless, but Board of Trade returns show exports last month of 40,000 tons, against 38,000 tons in February 1891. Stocks of Scotch iron in warrant stores have decreased to 498,000 tons, and those of Cleveland iron to 157,000 tons. The pig tin market has been easier during the last half of the week, with only moderate business on speculative account and hardly average purchases for consumption. The bulk of supply, however, is still very well under control. Copper has been active at a higher range of prices, with large purchases by consumers as well as brisk speculative trading. Further reports of a combination of American producers to regulate production and secure better prices have been instrumental in helping prices upward, but better purchases for consumption and improvement in European statistical positions helped to strengthen the market. Tin plate has been in fair demand, but large buyers hold aloof, owing to lack of confidence in the future of the market. Business has been chiefly in lightweight Bessemer squares at 11s 0d, and Siemens do at 12s 3d f.o.b. Swansea. Exports last month were 33,000 tons, including 23,000 tons to the United States, against 82,000 tons and 88,000 tons in February 1891. Ship plates were very quiet, and the market remained easy. Several mills in the Cumberland district are idle owing to scarcity of orders and fuel. Old iron is rather weaker and more freely offered. Scotch pig iron demand continues slow, and prices have undergone little change. No. 1 Collins, f.o.b. Glasgow, 53s; No. 1 Siemens, f.o.b. Glasgow, 50s 6d; No. 1 Ganshorie, f.o.b. Glasgow, nos; No. 1 Langloan, f.o.b. Glasgow, 51s 6d; No. 1 Carnbroe, f.o.b. Glasgow, 43s 6d; No. 1 Shotts, f.o.b. at Leith, 52s; No. 1 Glongarnoek, f.o.b. Ardrossan, 61s; No. 1 Dalmellington, f.o.b. Ardrossan, 48s; No. 1 Eglinton, f.o.b. Ardrossan, 47s. Steamer freights, Glasgow to New York, 2s; Liverpool to New York, 7s 6d. Cleveland pig, the market is unsettled, with fair business the last few days at about 65s 0d for No. 1 f.o.b. Middlesborough. Bessemer pig business continues rather slow and the market is barely steady at 43s for West Coast brands, Nos. 1, 2, and 3, f.o.b. shipping port. Spiegoleisen, a very quiet market, with prices unchanged. English 20 percent quoted at 80s, f.o.b. shipping port. Steel rails, orders come forward slowly and the market is barely steady. Heavy sections quoted at 5s, f.o.b. shipping port. Steel bloom, there is little doing and prices are nominal: makers ask 12s 11d for 7x7, f.o.b. shipping point. Steel billets, dealings are still of moderate volume and makers' prices without change. Bessemer, 2½x2½ inches, quoted at 45s, f.o.b. shipping point. Steel slabs, very slow market, and no change in sellers' prices. Bessemer quoted at 64 5s, f.o.b. at shipping point. Old iron mills, demand runs light and prices are easy, without quotable change. Tees quoted at 2 17s 6d, and double heads at 3, f.o.b. Scrap iron, there has been a fair business, and prices steady. Heavy wrought iron quoted at 2 8d-2 12s 6d, f.o.b. Crop ends dull market for these and prices unchanged. Bessemer quoted at 2 12s 6d-2 15s, f.o.b. Tin plate, demand is irregular and prices still lean in sellers' favor. We quote f.o.b., Liverpool: 10 charcoal, Alloway grade, 14s-14s 6d; 16 Bessemer steel, toke finish, 12s 6d-12s 9d; 10 Siemens steel coke finish, 12s 0d-13s; 12 coke, B.

18920314: Prices are about 1 per cwt above last year. Kangoons are firmly held at a considerable advance. New crop is being bought so freely amid Indian wants. Prices are high, but shippers say they must go higher, for as they have lost heavily upon the 50,000 tons already sold, they decline to make further sales. Smalls or granulated rice on the spot in Europe and new crop to arrive are again some 6d per cwt higher. The quantity of small or granulated to be made this year is expected to be low, as a much larger proportion of the Burmese rice crop has been sold as rough to adjacent countries, so that the product of the rough rice mills in the Burmese ports will be much less than usual. We hear of new crop smalls for English markets to the extent of 6,000 to 6,000 tons having been resold by buyers to sellers, and the shipments presumably canceled at a loss of about 1d per cwt. This explains fully the current high prices of granulated rice for old and new crop deliveries.

DAILY RECEIPTS

The receipts posted on 'Change today were as follows: G. T. U. Cheese furnishes nothing worthy of mention. Butter was quiet, with very little doing today, e.g., creamery 20-22; firm milk 18-20; Morrisburg and Rockyville 18-19; Western dairy 18-17. The New York Commercial Bulletin says: "The market has continued quiet all the week, and while receipts have been larger, the proportion of fancy table grades does not show much increase. Still, the continued absence of demand of importance and advices of a tendency to an increase in the make have caused a weak and unsettled feeling, with a disposition on the part of holders to put prices down to a point that would attract increased attention. Pennsylvania creamery has not been in large supply and bulk working out to grocery trade, but prices lower in sympathy with the general depression. Elgin creamery very uncertain. The stock here cost high prices, and holders have tried to get out with as little loss as possible, and in a small way have exceeded quotations, but on the open market 29c is the extreme. Other finest Western has declined to 28c-28½c, and the latter is very extreme, and few receivers would hesitate to accept 28c to clean up. Firsts are plenty, dull and weak, with 20c-20½c top prices, while seconds are obtainable at 22c-23c. June Western is very dull and lower. New state dairy tubs have ruled slow and tending to accumulate, and 25c-62½c have become extreme prices for the finest, while bulk shows irregular quality and offering from 24c down. Old State dairy very dull and weaker. Imitation creamery quiet, with 22c-23c top prices for best lots. Fresh factory has been plenty and lower. Exporters have taken a few lots at about 17c, but the scarcity of freight room interferes with exporters' operations. Cheese has had another week that probably at the best could only be called fairly active, and shows no further gain in value. Shippers do not appear to have found any backing that would permit them to pay much attention to the really fancy goods, and while the deal for export took out a couple of good-sized parcels and a number of smaller caliber, they were about all made up of something below finest and thence along down into the mediums and the bulk of the hard skims, though all the latter were not forwarded for want of freight room. The home trade movement was somewhat fluctuating, but rarely animated, and buyers in a majority of cases appeared pretty well impressed with the notion of keeping their investments as close as possible to limits of early wants. In a general way, the position has been very well supported by holders who have maintained the former line of valuation, and in no case, so far as can be learned, made any direct effort to realize beyond the scope of the naturally developed inquiry, but all bids at old rates were accepted, and some lots of stock have been tendered for negotiation not before available. There is, in point of fact, just a toning down of bullish sentiment to be noticeable without amounting to any reaction, yet sufficient to make the bearish inclined element pick up its ears and commence to suggest adverse features. The failure of the English demand to go on to fancy cheese, the progress of the season and the temptation of ruling prices as a basis for an early and full make of new crop, and even in the face of post-winter blizzards and cold snaps, the chance for a warm spell to impair quality covers about the current talk at the moment, but the effect upon the market is not noticeable. It is simply an effect of the present condition of trade.

The egg market continues easy in tone. Friday's storm was thought would have a strengthening effect, but it was of too short a duration. The stocks west of Toronto are very large, and so long as they can be moved without difficulty, the same easy feeling will prevail. We quote fresh 15c-16c and limed 13c. Considering the state of other markets, prices are very high here. Fresh are selling at 13c in Toronto and limed at 10c-11c.

COFFEE MARKET

The coffee market during the week showed no feature of interest, being intensely dull. Brazilian markets continue to show a fair disposition to accept any bid and sold on the basis of 13c-13½c for Ts. The world's visible supply of March 1 shows an increase of 107,000 bags over February. Warehouse deliveries in New York continue exceedingly large, and there is no indication as yet of an oversupply in the inland markets. Appearances now tend to show a notable increase in the consumption of coffee in the United States in excess of any yet since 1894, when prices were much lower.

London, March 11. Calcutta linseed at 39s 6d per quarter. Spirits of turpentine at 2£ 6d per cwt. Rosin American strained at 4s 7½d per cwt. Sperm oil at £47 per ton. Linseed oil at 18s 6d per cwt.

18920315: J. Pheljis, ex-minister to England, had an interview with the President on the Retiring Sea affair. The matter before the Senate: The Senate in executive session to-day spent an hour in the discussion of the Retiring Sea question. The matter came before the Senate in the shape of a message from the President in reply to a resolution requesting further information as to the effect of pelagic sealing. The President sent extracts from official reports of the Retiring Sea Commissioners showing that, contrary to Lord Salisbury's statement, the British commission had conceded that the seals had diminished in numbers by the hand of man, which, of course, meant largely through the action of the poachers in killing the seals at sea. The message was laid before the Senate and read. Short speeches were made by Senators Sherman, Butler, and Morgan, of the Committee on Foreign Relations, and by Messrs. Piatt, White, and others. At their conclusion, the papers were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. 

Killing Out for Police Service. Washington; March 14. The steamer Thetis has arrived at San Diego and will be ordered to San Francisco to be fitted out for service in the Retiring Sea. 

Chicago Board of Trade Discipline. CHICAGO, March 14. In the case of the temporary injunction against the directors of the Board of Trade restraining them from hearing charges against Baldwin & Furnam, preferred by Elick Lowita, to the effect that they had defrauded their customers by unprofessional methods of dealing, Judge Horton to-day decided that the Board of Trade is an involuntary association; that its members consent to be governed by its rules and regulations; that it has final and complete jurisdiction affecting the discipline of the members and that, therefore, the injunction must be dissolved. 

Freight Trains Wrecked. YONKERS, March 14. All trains on the New York Central and Hudson River railroad are delayed here by a wreck which occurred at 4:45 this afternoon. The trouble was caused by one southbound freight train running into the rear of another. Seven cars and the engine of the second train were demolished and the wreckage was strewn over the track. The wreckage caught fire and the contents of one of the cars, consisting of general merchandise, were destroyed. The colliding trains were southbound freight trains from Albany to New York. 

The Sugar Trust's New York. NEW YORK, March 14. All the principal interests in the Richmond Terminal Company will meet tomorrow in this city and the affairs of the company will be adjusted. The Stock Exchange to-day placed on the unlisted departments $25,000,000 new Sugar stock, which was authorized at the last meeting of the stockholders of the Sugar trust. This is taken as a confirmation of the story that the Trust has absorbed all the competing refineries and will have a complete monopoly of the sugar trade. The officials of the Trust decline to make any statements. 

Volume of East-Bound Freight. CHICAGO, March 14. There was a big decrease in the volume of east-bound freight last week as compared with that of the week before. The total number of tons by all lines was 61,475, while that of the previous week was 100,592. The shipments, however, amounted to about 11,000 tons more than they did during the corresponding week last year. Through shipments of flour, grain, and provisions by the lines in the Central Traffic Association amounted to 47,054 tons, against 68,122 for the preceding week. 

Severe Blizzard in Kansas. Kansas City, Mo., March 14. Despatches from points all over Kansas report that a severe blizzard is raging. The weather throughout the state was warm Saturday; yesterday a change in the atmosphere took place, and at night a heavy snow driven by a strong wind set in. The snow is of the hard variety, and wherever it drifts it forms banks as hard as sand. Trains on the Santa Fe main line west of Newton are delayed on account of the storms. 

A Broken Flywheel's Work. Cincinnati, March 14. Shortly before 1 o'clock this morning, the gigantic flywheel at the Cincinnati electric light works broke. It was 24 feet high, weighed 24 tons, and was making 73 revolutions per minute. It smashed the engine, the office, crushed several dynamos, and knocked out one side of the building. Loss: $20,000. There were narrow escapes, but no one was hurt. 

The Cuban Treaty All Right. Washington, March 14. The disputed questions arising out of the reciprocity treaty with Cuba have been decided by the Spanish government at Madrid in favor of the United States, and orders accordingly have been issued at Havana. The treaty is very popular in Cuba and this action of the Spanish Government gives great satisfaction. 

Another Electrocution Coming. FRESNO, March 14. Warden Brown, of the State prison, is preparing for the execution by electricity of James E. Winbaugh, convicted of the murder of Edward Moran on December 21, 1896. The execution is expected to be carried out on Monday next, the first day of the week set by Recorder Smythe, of New York, for Winbaugh to die. 

Fatal Elevator Accident. St. Louis, March 14. While two boys were lowering an elevator loaded with iron at Rohan Bros.' boiler factory today, the rope broke and the elevator fell to the floor beneath. Three workmen who were standing below were caught and crushed to death. The boys were flung out of the elevator and seriously hurt. 

A Natural Gas Strike. Kansas City, Mo., March 14. The Midland Hotel Company, in sinking an artesian well on its property here, struck natural gas at a depth of 800 feet. The gas was carried in a flue up to the second-story windows of the hotel, where it was ignited. When burning at night, the center of the city is illuminated for an iron ground. 

A Benefit Order. BOSTON, March 14.

18920405: Feed remains the same, with bran and shorts steady. We quote bran $11, shorts $17, and meal $23. Wheat is dull on spot, with nothing in the way of spot business to note. Barley, peas, and oats and the coarser grains furnish nothing specially worthy of mention. We quote values generally as follows: No. 2 hard Manitoba, 95c-96c; No. 3 do, 87c-90c; No. 2 Northern, 90c-95c; peas, 72c-74c per 60 pounds; oats, 31c per 31 pounds for Quebec; Ontario, 34c per 34 pounds; corn, 60c-62c, duty paid; feed barley, 42c-43c; good malting do nominal. 

At Chicago, wheat was firmer, closing at 79c May, 80c July. Corn closed at 39c May, 37c June, 37.5c July, and oats at 28c May, 28c June, 27c July. Messrs. Schwartz, Dupee, and McCormick, of Chicago, telegraph Oswald Bros., 13 and 15 Hospital Street, as follows: "Wheat today was firmer, May opened at 78.5c, sold between 78c and 80c, and closed at 79c. The approaching holiday here had some effect, with New York and St. Louis bullishly inclined, and with Chicago closed up Tuesday. It was apprehended that the market might be run. The scareboard was made bullish by the very small world's wheat shipments. The Northwest reported a very large decrease in its country stock, and North Dakota also promised a blizzard. There was talk of a large cash wheat business. Caldes were very weak again, and the Hatch bill, as agreed upon unanimously by the committee, was considered very dangerous legislation for all grain markets. For some reason or other, however, the bear news was rejected. The decrease in the visible supply, 2,000,000 bushels, was about as expected. The outside news is no more bullish on wheat than it was last week. The crop prospects continue good and the export clearances small. These are important facts and are the causes which affect the market." 

Corn was just barely steady. May sold between 38c and 39c and closed at 39c with light receipts and poor grading. This was just about offset by the very dull trade. The little advance which was scored was in sympathy with wheat. Oats kept firm in sympathy with wheat. The provision market was weak under free selling by local packers, the chief buyers being shorts. The receipts of hogs estimated for tomorrow are only 16,000. This is accounted for by the bad roads and tomorrow's legal holiday. 

Messrs. Oswald Bros., 13 and 15 Hospital Street, report the opening, closing, highest, and lowest quotations of grain and provisions at Chicago today as follows: 

Wheat: 
May 79.5 79.5 79.5 79.5

Messrs. Irwin, Green & Co.'s Chicago special to the Gazette says: "The full text of the Hatch bill was published Saturday night and the trade has had time to digest it. While the general opinion is that its own provisions should be sufficient to preclude a moment's consideration by any ordinary intelligent body of men, yet it hangs as a menace to business in all commodities affected by its terms and tends to demoralization. It was the chief depressing factor in our markets today. Wheat recovered partially only because of unusually strong conditions. About 300,000 bushels of No. 2 spring wheat was worked here at the May price. The Straits reported practically open now, but vessels will not hasten to leave for the lower lakes until there is less ice in Lake Erie. The world's wheat shipments were a million and a quarter bushels less than last week. Early cables were easier, but foreign markets improved with us towards the close. Corn was quiet and the range of prices very small. The selling of quite a line of long stuff weakened the market early, the trade feeling the effects of Hatch bill talk, as in all other markets. The weather operates as a bullish factor. Provisions were dull and dragging. The chief feature was the turning over of a line of May lard to July by a packing house. The fact that tomorrow is a local holiday had a restrictive effect on business in all pits." 

At New York, wheat closed steady at 88c April, 88c May, 88c June, 80c July, 78c August, 67c September, 68c December. Corn closed at 47c April, 46c May, 41c June, 44c July, 44c August, and oats at 34.5c April, 34c May, 34c June, 34c July. At St. Louis, wheat closed at 83c cash, 83c April, 84c May. Corn closed at 35c cash; 34c April, 34c May, 35.5c July, and oats at 28c cash, 28c April, 28.5c May. At Toledo, wheat closed steady at 83c cash, 88c April, 88c May, 83c July, 82c August. Corn and oats closed dull at 39c cash, 39c May, and 30c cash. At Duluth, No. 1 hard closed at 79c cash, 81c May, and No. 1 Northern at 77.5c cash, 78c May.

18920611: BELTIM COMPANY, 894 St. James St. IT IS HARRISON AL RED. Mr. Blaine Cut a Very Poor Figure in the Voting at Minneapolis. ONLY ONE BALLOT NEEDED to Renominate the President—McKinley’s Belt Sacrifice. A New York Editor the Tail of the Ticket. Mr. Blaine on the Result. MINNEAPOLIS, June 16—The fourth day of the convention opened with a miniature Dakota blizzard. It was not cold and it was not accompanied by snow or hail, but it was lively enough to tear from their places the decorations which adorned the buildings along the principal streets. The rain fell in torrents for a time, but the storm was of short duration and the sky soon cleared. At 10 o'clock, an hour before the convention was to meet, not a band had appeared on the streets and there was but a small crowd turning toward Convention Hall. It was evident that the convention would be late in assembling. Chairman McKinley appeared shortly before 11 o'clock and looked rather wearied as a result of last night's vigil. It was also before a quorum had taken their seats, and at that hour, by way of consolation to the Blaine supporters, the band opened the musical program with "The Lost Chord." At 11:37 the convention was called to order. Prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. Wayland Hoyt, of the First Baptist Church of Minneapolis. The chair made the qualifying announcement to the convention that Senator Quay had authorized him to say that no further opposition would be made to the adoption of the majority report. The question was then put and the majority report was unanimously adopted amid cheers. The Michigan delegation were permitted to retire for consultation and in the interim Warner Miller of New York, sent up to the desk and had read a women's suffrage memorial. Mr. Miller asked that the officers of the Women's Republican Association named in the communication be presented to the convention and this was done. Mrs.

18920708: I trained for Ste Anne's, arriving at 9:41. I proceeded at once to the tasteful and commodious home of the Gold Cure. Here I introduced myself to the genial Dr. Foster, who, on hearing that I came from Montreal, gave me a hearty welcome. I then proceeded to catechize the medical man in reference to certain much-discussed questions regarding the famous Gold Cure. "Does the Gold Cure kill anybody?" "No, never," replied Dr. Foster, "instances have occurred and been made much of by malicious newspapers and jealous, ignorant or prejudiced physicians, where patients have died shortly after being discharged, cured, from the Gold Cure institute. Now, what do these cases show, when properly investigated? Simply that the patient has been the victim of organic liver, kidney or lung disease, the result of long years of debauchery and exposure. Take a typical case: Here is a man with far advanced phthisis or tuberculosis, induced by lying drunk in the gutter in the pelting rain or driving snow, or on an open doorstep all night beneath the frosty skies of a January blizzard. He is brought to the Gold Cure, as a last resort, to cure his drinking habits. He remains the allotted three or four weeks, and goes home fully and completely cured forever of his taste for alcohol. In a month or two he is dead. 'The Gold Cure did it.' The traducers and the unthinking public take up the cry without investigation or scientific proof. The Gold Cure will unfailingly cure drunkenness in every shape or form; this its opponents don't attempt successfully to deny, so they are compelled to fall back on libelous inventions, false reasoning and willful perversion of facts. What we undertake absolutely to cure is drunkenness, but to replace a pair of varnished lungs or renew a 'hob-nail' liver is not within the scope of the Gold Cure, or in fact of any other cure known to mortal man. You must also remember that many cases seek the Gold Cure when far advanced in the throes of delirium tremens. If such patients, in isolated instances, soon after coming to our institute, pistol or throw themselves out of an open window, before the cure has had a fair chance to get in its work on them, can this be reasonably laid at its door? No; as well blame the ordinary antipyretic remedies for the self-destruction of a patient delirious through fever. We must seek for carelessness or ignorance on the part of nurse or guardian, to that, unhesitatingly, I repeat that the Gold Cure cannot authentically be charged with directly or indirectly causing the premature death of a single one of its thousands and thousands of patients, but, on the contrary, has rescued hundreds who were tottering on the very verge of a drunkard's grave. "But doctor, is the cure lasting?" "It is. In fact, many patients who have been cured for months and years, have assured me that before they took the cure their desire for alcohol kept growing more and more intense every day, fight it off as they would, trying to stave off the evil day and make the sober interval between drunks as long as possible, till finally will power was conquered and the much dreaded debauch broke out without restraint. Whereas, after experiencing the Cure, the disgust for, or indifference to, alcohol becomes more deeply rooted as time goes by. The very memory of liquor has faded away. Such men are free agents. They, like burnt children, dread the... tire, and with reason, desire and will all on their side, no longer fear their adversary, King Alcohol. If, however, a person is determined on self-destruction and educates himself to drink again, he can, of course, do so, but will find it much harder than will an individual who has never before tasted liquor. What more in reason can be asked?" 

"How many days does it take you to cure drunkenness?" 

"Three or four weeks. We can cure absolutely the worst cases of drunkenness on earth in three to four weeks." 

Here I asked: "Is it also true that you treat the opium, morphine, and cocaine habits?" 

"Yes." 

"And are they also cured in three or four weeks?" 

"No, they take four, six, and, in some very bad cases, eight weeks for an absolute cure. We have cases here now who spent a year in secluded isolation at Guelph with no benefit whatever. In fact, such patients, on discharge, as a rule, break out worse than ever to make up for lost time. These cases, with us, are doing well after one week's treatment." 

"How are patients doing who have been discharged from your Institute?" 

"Well, they are all occupying good positions, attending to their duties, and feeling better than they remember ever being in their lives before. They seem to have taken a new lease of life. We can refer enquirers to them." 

"Is it necessary that a patient should be subjected to publicity during treatment?" 

"Not in the slightest. We are treating patients here privately now, and not even their most intimate friends are aware of it. You see, people can come here for a summer's outing and take the Gold Cure at the same time. The patient may be treated in his own apartment if he so chooses. Ladies are always treated privately. But I may say that once you convince a man that alcoholism is a disease, he ceases to be falsely ashamed of it, especially when he witnesses the practical results of the cure in other patients." 

"It seems rather absurd for a man not to be ashamed of drunkenness, yet afraid to have anyone aware of his taking a cure for the same." 

The doctor then politely showed me around the building, introducing me to several of the patients, one and all of whom had but the same story to tell of the beneficial effects of the treatment. It was an easy matter to pick out the ones who had been at the institute a fortnight from the arrivals of only a few days. The former presented all the brightness of eye, steadiness of hand, and clearness of complexion found in healthy men. All, with the exception of the alert and busy doctor, seemed to be enjoying one long joyous holiday. Fishing and boating on the river and long walks and drives through the attractive surrounding country are much indulged in by the patients. They are under no restraint whatever, beyond reporting to the physicians four times a day at convenient hours for treatment. 

On shaking hands with the doctor just before leaving for the city, I fired a parting shot: "Is it true that you don't refuse your patients their ordinary supply of whiskey?" 

"We give them all of the very best liquor they can drink, and as often as they want it. They don't want it very long. In from two to three days after commencing treatment, they have no more use for it, and that ends the business." 

"Wonderful and almost presumptuous as seemed to my mind the claims of the doctor, I left Ste. Anne's, convinced in my own mind that they are able to bear the test of facts and close inspection. If you doubt them, as I did myself at first, go and see in propria persona."

Gladstone's Latest Home Rule Declaration 

Concerning home rule, Mr. Gladstone in a declaration says that the bill will follow the general line of the measure of 1886, with some changes, including the retention of Irish members in the Imperial Parliament, the employment of the police and military to enforce the payment of all taxes leviable by the Irish Parliament, restricting the powers of the Irish Legislature to interfere with the endowment of religion, or to confer privilege on account of religious belief, and giving further guarantees regarding denominational education. He referred to the adjustment of the pecuniary burdens of Ireland and alluded to a revision of the proposals relating to the arrangements between the Imperial and Irish exchequers and the proportion of the national debt to be assigned to Ireland. In 1880 this was calculated as one-fifteenth for Ireland, based upon estimates of taxation, rateable values, etc. This has been found to be a gross over-estimate, entailing over-taxation of the Irish people. The financial inquiry long engaged Mr. Gladstone's attention, and in it he was assisted by Mr. Goschen. Inquiry tends to show that Ireland can only be justifiably apportioned about one twenty-second part of the debt, making a very great difference in adjusting the pecuniary burdens under the new bill.

Gladstone Instance Canada 

At West Calder, Mr. Gladstone spoke in a disused quarry for an hour and twenty minutes with unabated vigor. After a passing reference to Ireland, he proceeded to cite Tory prophecies made with the view of retarding and defeating the Liberal proposals. The most effective portion of the striking and admirably marshaled list, given with dramatic force and skill which hugely delighted the audience, was the instance of the Earl of Derby's opposition in 1837 to the proposal to concede free government to Canada. "It would be utter ruin," Lord Derby had said, "and would lead to the establishment of a sort of French republic in Lower Canada, and would hand over the English-born minority to the tender mercies of the French colonists." It was precisely such a speech as might be made by Mr. Balfour or Lord Salisbury, although the Earl of Derby was discussing Canada in a less violent manner than Lord Salisbury was discussing Ireland. Against the Earl of Derby's prophecy, Mr. Gladstone placed the testimony which Sir Alexander Gait, formerly high commissioner in Great Britain for Canada, delivered the other night, to the effect that Canada had flourished exceedingly and had become more closely united with the mother country. "So," said Mr. Gladstone, in an eloquent passage, "would it be with Ireland when she enjoyed the blessings of home rule."

Consequences Must Be Considered 

Referring to the desire of the people of the locality for the imposition of a tax on foreign oils, Mr. Gladstone said it would be impossible to consider the practicability of such proposals without considering the consequences to which they would lead in other quarters. If articles competing with the products of one district were taxed, they must be prepared to lay corresponding taxes on other foreign produce. He contended that the system of free trade had caused an enormous improvement in the condition of the working people. The Conservatives prophecied that the establishment of home rule would lead to trouble in Ireland. Mr. Gladstone's answer to this was that it would lead to prosperity. The Conservatives' predictions on the results of every reform, he said, had been worthless, preposterous fabrications by which the people had been deluded and misled. 

John Morley's Predicament 

If Mr. John Morley becomes a minister, he will have to be re-elected. His opponents in Newcastle mean to nominate Joseph Cowan to oppose him. Mr. Cowan is immensely popular and the Conservatives believe he would be likely to oust Mr. Morley. Anticipating a new Cabinet, the permanent heads of the departments here, as is customary, sought to learn what new ministers they are likely to be required to serve. A leading treasury official told the representative of the Associated Press that he had obtained an intimation that Henry Fowler would be chancellor of the exchequer and Sir William Vernon Harcourt, first lord of the treasury and Government leader in the House of Commons. This arrangement contains a startling implication that Mr. Gladstone will either retire to the House of Lords or that he will take the lightest post in the Government, the presidency of the council. Not the slightest inkling of his intention has as yet reached the chiefs of the departments.

18920722: 5 E I'PEACHEAN'S RETURN 

Interviewed by a "Gazette" Reporter on His Trip Through the Northwest 

In view of the Vast Crop of the Territories 

New Developments in Horse Racing 

Railroad Extension 

Since the Northwest Territories have become the granary of the Dominion, all experienced men arriving in Montreal from beyond the lakes are closely questioned by Montreal merchants and capitalists as to the condition of the crops at this critical period of their growth. Dr. D'Arcy McKachran, chief veterinary inspector for the Dominion, who has just gone over Manitoba and a large portion of Alberta and the other territories, was seen by a Gazette reporter on this subject and spoke as follows: "In Manitoba, the crops are very promising, and although the straw may be a little shorter than usual, the wheat will probably mature earlier on this account; spent a day in Brandon, drove about the country considerably, and from the splendid outlook in that section, I take it for granted that everything there is all right. They are now favored with beautiful weather and have had plenty of rain." 

The doctor then described the large immigrant trains he met with and the number of well-to-do English gentlemen who were going over the country selecting suitable farms for their sons. "He, in fact, was much pleased at the quality of this year's influx into Western Canada." 

The reporter questioned the doctor as to the condition of the ranches in Alberta this year, and he replied that the April blizzard had caused considerable losses, more particularly along Willow Creek and the level country east of the rolling foothills. The large ranches, such as Cochrane's and Walrond's, escaped with comparatively little loss, as was evidenced by both of those ranches branding a very small number less than last year. The season, however, was dry, especially in the... McLeod district, yet the stock never looked in better condition than at the present time. Ranching, however," continued Dr. McEachran, "is in an uncertain and unsettled condition pending the decision of the Department of the Interior with reference to the lands leased to the different companies nine years ago. While I was in Alberta, several meetings were held by the ranchmen for the purpose of laying their views before the Government. One memorial in particular asked the Ottawa authorities to appoint a commission to report upon the whole question before deciding upon a policy which might possibly lead to the closing out of the whole ranch business and the withdrawal of from six to eight million dollars of capital which has been invested in that business in Alberta." 

"Pure breeding," said Dr. McEachran, "is going on in a most satisfactory manner. I visited Quorn Ranch, which has 1,000 horses; High River, 900; Cross Ranch, 800; Winder, 800; and our own ranch, which breeds 700 heavy horses such as Clydesdales and Shires. I met Mr. Gordon Cuthbert and Mr. Polkes, who were visiting the different ranches selecting horses to the extent of 100 for an experimental shipment to Great Britain. These gentlemen purpose taking the horses, which are principally carriage, saddle, and hunters, to Seary's farm in Bothwell, Ont., where they will be broken and mannered, preparatory to their shipment from Montreal towards the end of September. I also visited the Pakan Indians as they were preparing for a sun dance at Fort McLeod and found the tribe making most satisfactory progress in agriculture. The agent said the Indians worked well in the fields, and the leaders of the tribe added that they were quite contented with their lot."

"The doctor also stated that the Calgary and Edmonton railway construction party had reached the new town site of Fort McLeod and, were it not for a slight delay caused in getting the sleepers down from the mountains, the road would be finished by the middle of August. It is from this point that the proposed Canadian Pacific extension through the Crow's Nest Pass will start."

1892-08-26: T. Grein was noticed not long since in our columns. He has had the advantage of a life both in his native Holland and in the Dutch East Indies, particularly in Batavia, Java! The effect of this tropical experience is seen in the luxuriant picturesqueness of some of his descriptions. The description of this novel, as the title suggests, reveals the terrible necessity that works death and despair to friends and lovers, which recalls the ruthless tyranny of the old Greek Ananke. The translation, by Clara J. Keil, has that lady's characteristic merits. Mr. Gesso's introduction adds much to the interest of the book which, in spite of occasional exaggeration, is charged with traumatic power. 12mo, cloth. New York: D. Appleton & Co., 13 and 15 Bond Street; Montreal: W. Foster Brown & Co.

A Little Norsk

"A Little Norsk, or Tap's Flaxen," by Hamlin Garland, is a story of life in the great bleak western plains, the land of blizzards, which is also a land of sunshine. Both the roughness and the tender warmth are reflected in the hearts of the simple-minded heroes. "Flaxen" is a study for a painter as well as for a student of sociology, her education, early and late, being all the more interesting from its contrasts. The delicacy of the untutored, but kingly, men who adopted her and under whose protection she grew up is exquisitely brought out, as are also their perplexities about dress and other feminine themes. Elga's choice of Kendall for a husband, Bert's disappointment and flight, the baby's birth, and the catastrophe which left Elga a widow, are all so many stages towards the denouement that the reader has long since begun to look for. What it was, it is not for us to disclose. Dramatic necessity demanded the sacrifice of the ill-fated Kendall, but it is, in our judgment, one of the faults of the author that he should have associated that unworthy husband's inferiority with shortcomings of physique and petty details of dress, while Anson's virtues are mysteriously connected with his gigantic stature and disregard for externals. The strange thing is that Mr. Garland makes us sympathize with these unphilosophical parallels and contrasts, in spite of Goliath and Polyphemus and the victims of our British gigantophant. The dress of the book is as charming as its price (50 cents), which is low. (New York: D. Appleton & Co; Montreal: W. Foster Brown & Co.)

A Tale of a Day and an Hour

"A Tale of Twenty-five Hours" is a cooperative mystification by Brander Matthews and George H. Jessop. "Imaginary terrors scare a timorous soul with mortal fear," wrote a 17th-century poet, and when a suspicious friend or lover gives in to his morbid fancy, not even his nearest and dearest are secure from his distrust. The skill of the literary partners has, however, wrought upon our terrors in this ephemeral tale only to give us the rapture of finding the world better than we had been led to deem it. The basis of the comedy is the spoliation of a work of art, the remembrance of which has not quite faded from the overburdened mind of a news-loving public. Dress comely, as indicated in the preceding notice, only that green is changed to blue. $0.50. (New York: D. Appleton & Co; Montreal: W. Foster Brown & Co.)

Gramercy Park

This is a story of New York, and, if it has a moral, it is that husbands and wives should not be long apart. In the working out of the plot, which is not very complicated, we get some glimpses of phases of life which might be called ultra-domestic. The climax of the would-be innocent flirtation of the hero who is, as the author admits, not excessively heroic, reaches its height when Miss Francioli dives after and rescues De Ford from a watery grave. After that, he no longer attempts to hide from himself that he is leading a "dual life." To his wife, his "madonna," as he calls her, he is still devoted, and she has no suspicion, so far as he can discover, of his duplicity. But Nemesis is on his track, and it finds its victim rather through an absurd blunder, the misdirection of some gifts of jewelry. But "further deponent saith not," and the author is doubtless right to avoid a conventional, hackneyed ending. We are still in the dark as to the ultimatum of the aggrieved wife, though her father has spoken harshly and her mother gently to the offender, in accordance with their respective natures. It was one of the old gentleman's sayings, in his mood of righteous wrath, about things of which he could not approve, that "New York is not Paris, thank God!" It seems to be the opinion of the author of Gramercy Park, Mr. John Seymour Wood, that Lutetian qualities are not unknown in the trans-Medial habitat of the new world. Style of dress as before, only the price, 50 cents. (New York: D. Appleton & Co; Montreal: W. Foster Brown & Co.)

Far From To-Day

One does not have to read many pages of this captivating book to learn that Miss Gertrude Hall has left the beaten path of the hackneyed and commonplace behind. Of learning, she has her share, for from ages and peoples parted by centuries and by thousands of leagues of ocean, as one to the manner born of her community and period, she must have traveled, like the Odyssean, till she had made herself at home in the dwelling places and the lives of many men. That she has that gift which comes neither by travel nor study, howbeit thereby developed and improved, which was the grand achievement of the Ithacan's creator, is clearly evident to the reader whose sight is not dim. Six tales, some little more than sketches, are contained, and on the titles and the heraldic symbolism of the cover, every one of them deals with scenes and personas and times that are far from each other as well as from today. The story of Tristiane, with his lion and his harper-like memories, introduces us to great characters to which we are proudly connected. In "Silvanus," which dimly recalls Hawthorne's and the elder Lytton's genius, we are shifted to another of the same great race. In "The Philemon," we are carried still further from today and the things of it, and lighted with a picture of old Greek life that should gladden the soul of Prof. H. The story of Antiope and her boys, of their rivalries in love, of their respective destinies, and of the dread closing scene, charged with memories from Theocritus and Euripides, recalls a passage in the Iliad. The transport of the soul in the face of the deep and the far-off landscape that we find in Philemon's sons and Lycaon's daughter is still discernible, and from afar we are touched as by living fingers and voices for a grief that is sacred. "Theodofind" and "Shepherds" still further illustrate Miss Hall's many-sidedness, the latter initiating us into mysteries of consciousness that provoke question or compel silence. As to "Theodolind," fine is the author's treatment of her tragic theme, and vividly the fierce, strong figures of heathen warriors, and the softened fervor of a woman pleading for mercy in Christ's new-found name, stand out on her canvas. In all such exercise of historic imagination, there is indeed a danger in the temptation to ascribe modern sentiments and reflections to generations that knew them not. This temptation is especially to be guarded against when the dramatis personae are uncivilized, still more when they are of the savage or semi-barbarous type. This danger Miss Hall has anticipated us in perceiving and avoiding. She has used her imagination with judgment and has employed her learning to good purpose in producing a series of admirable pictures of many times and climes. Her book bears the stamp of genius. Price, $1. (Boston: Roberts Brothers; Montreal: W. Foster Brown & Co.)

Mansfield Park

Our readers have already been made aware of the publication by Messrs. Roberts Brothers of a beautiful new edition of Miss Austen's novels. "Pride and Prejudice" has already been noticed in our columns, and now we have pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of "Mansfield Park," in two volumes, each with a frontispiece by Garrett. These illustrations are of exceptional merit for choice and treatment of theme, for fidelity to history as to costumes, and for a large-minded interpretation of the author's motive and spirit. As to the works themselves, it is needless to do more than recall the judgments of such masters as Sir Walter Scott, Southey, and Lord Macaulay, all of whom thought most highly of Jane Austen's creations. The edition will be completed in twelve 16mo volumes, bound in half ruby morocco, gilt top, at the price of $1.25 a volume. It is limited to 1,000 copies. A special edition will be printed on laid paper, medium 8vo, bound in russet cloth, and limited to 250 copies. The price of the latter will be $2 per volume. (Boston: Roberts Brothers; Montreal: W. Foster Brown & Co.)

The Hope of the Gospel

It has, doubtless, been forgotten by many of his readers that George MacDonald is a clergyman, and that the delivery of sermons was once part of his regular duty. His theology may, indeed, be studied in his novels and poems. He has also published a volume of Unspoken Sermons. Whether the discourses in the volume that bears the title which forms the above heading were spoken or not we are not informed, as the book has no preface. They have the appearance of ordinary sermons, such as are preached from the pulpits of most denominations, each of them having a text, which furnishes the preacher with his theme. The subjects are Salvation from Sin, the Remission of Sin, Jesus in the World, Jesus and his Fellow Townsmen, God's Family, the Yoke of Jesus, the Hope of the Universe, etc. The sermon that bears this last title will be a surprise to old-fashioned people, though the theory with which the main argument in it is supported is not new even in Christian thought. Among some of the kindlier peoples of the East, it is a firm belief, which is... Here is the corrected text:

The more devout consistently acted up to the belief that the lower animals are human beings in another shape. Mr. Macdonald, in his eager opposition to cruelty, even on scientific or philanthropic grounds, would rescue this gentle creed from its absurdity. His text is from the Epistle to the Romans (viii, 19): "For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God." In his denunciation of all unmercifulness, Mr. Macdonald is fearlessly outspoken. In another sermon, he says that "to call into being the necessarily and hopelessly incomplete would be to wrong creation in its very essence." There is a consecutiveness in the sermons, each one leading up to the next, and the whole series forming a sort of confession of faith which justifies the general title and the culmination of the final text. If there is any departure from the creed of his own branch of Christendom in Mr. Macdonald's utterances, it is rather in the direction of excess of faith and superabundance of hope than in that of denying any dogma that his church deems essential. (New York: D. Appleton & Co; Montreal: W. Foster Brown & Co.)

A Honeymoon Quarrel: In "Capt'n Davy's Honeymoon," Mr. Hall Caine has struck out for himself a new path, although, being "A Manx Yarn," it is, in some of its features, familiar enough. It is the mood that has changed. "The Deemster" and "The Bondman" are certainly more tragic than comic, but this latest production of Mr. Caine's teeming imagination is a sure comedy, even according to Dante's definition, seeing that it ends prosperously for all. Its rough beginning, though amusing, and forcible as is its moral, might, perhaps, succeed better on the stage than in the printed page. As a study of Manx manners, it has an interest, and as a challenge to those who fancy that Mr. Caine cannot be light when he pleases, it serves its purpose. With all these merits, we commend it to our readers. Price $1. (New York: D. Appleton & Co; Montreal: W. Foster Brown & Co.)

Ktelka's Tow is another study of Austrian life by the author of "Orthodox," "A Queen of Curds and Cream," etc. The American duel on which it is founded is a somewhat mythical usage, but the superstructure of tragedy that Dorothea Gerard has raised upon it is none the less tragic. It has a heroine of an unsophisticated type, but neither Viktor nor his victim can be deemed heroic, save in the ancient sense. I would rather have "a sort of foil for Viktor, so haplessly victorious." The book is one of Appleton's Town and Country Library.

1892-09-07: FOUR WERE KILLED. Fatal Accident in the Blizzard Nickel Mine at Salisbury, Bynum-KY, Ont., September 6. A shocking accident occurred at the Blizzard nickel mine about 4 p.m., by which several men lost their lives and several others will likely die of their injuries. A large section of the roof fell in, completely burying twenty miners at the bottom. Four dead bodies have been taken out so far, and the wounded are being cared for by two local physicians at this town. It is impossible to obtain the names of the unfortunate men.

1892-10-07: The Royal Piano Company. "The Hand of Fate" is a stirring Western melodrama which will pack the Royal next week. It is full of interest and will delight lovers of realism on the stage. Several scenes introduced call for special mention. The blizzard scene, with its locomotive and snow plow as features, is especially noteworthy. The play is admirable throughout. It is headed by Miss Kliena Lellingwell, who plays the part of the heroine with rare discretion.

1892-10-11: P. Clark as John Langdale showed a clever piece of acting, whilst Mr. Miron Leffingwell scored well as Richard Grafton. Miss Kliena Lellingwell is the mainstay of the piece. Her portrayal of Buze, the rough, uncultured girl, but who was a loving sister, was excellent. Miss Lansing Rowan displayed considerable talent as Agnes Howard, as did also Miss Kinta Whittle as Aurora Langdale. The comedy was furnished by Mr. William Khea as Democles Short, while Mr. John Dowd, as Henry Miller, afterwards Rev., had a part well suited to him. For those who like sensation, the author has given plenty of thunder and lightning, chloroform, a blizzard, an explosion, and "deadly poison," but, of course, villainy is defeated and virtue rewarded. The scenery is good, and combined with a good company, "The Hand of Fate" will undoubtedly become a success with the habitués of the Royal.

Blocked by a Panther. Saddle River, N.J., November 8. As Charles K. Ruck was riding past a clump of trees that line a lonely road near Waldwick, N.J., Sunday, a huge wild cat sprang from a bough and nearly alighted on the animal's flank. The horse lashed out and landed the brute a dozen feet away, but the cat was by no means subdued. The instant it touched the ground, it bounded again to the terrified horse, which lashed along the road at a rapid pace. He borrowed a shotgun at an adjacent house to look for the cat, but it had disappeared. It is supposed to be one that escaped from a circus that had passed through that part of Jersey some months ago.

Attacked by Yacqui Indians. Phoenix, Ariz., November 8. A band of Yacqui Indians yesterday attacked the hacienda of Alexander Lacy, three leagues from Ortoz station, Mexico. At the time of the attack, Mr. and Mrs. Lacy and child were seated at the supper table. The Indians fired twice into the room, hitting Mrs. Lacy. The lights were extinguished and dishes shattered. Mr. Lacy reached a tower commanding the outside, and after severe fighting drove the Indians off, but not until they had succeeded in killing two Yacqui servants and compelling 21 others to accompany them. Mrs. Lacy is seriously wounded. Soldiers are in pursuit of the Yacquis.

At Chicago, wheat closed lower at 71½c November, 72½c December, 73¼c May. Corn closed steady at 41½c November, 42c December, 47c May, and oats easier at 30½c November, 31c December, 30c May. Messrs. Irwin, Green & Co.'s Chicago special to the Gazette says: "The day was by no means brisk in wheat, although a large quantity was marketed during the session. The general tone was somewhat weak and the close very nearly at inside prices. All the wheat bought yesterday on the various items of bull news noted in the letter of Friday was resold today, and considerable short stuff went with it. This caused weak and unsettled feeling and continued through the day. The wires were finally straightened out. The northwestern arrivals were about two thousand cars, accompanied by a decline up there of a cent, and this started selling here, and the cable news being firm, with dull markets, made us powerless to hold our price. English farmers sent 50,938 quarters to be sold, and they received 27s 11d for it, which was a reduction of fourpence. Our clearances were equal to about 433,000 bushels. The receipts were quite light in the West. The exports of both coasts for the week were equal to 8,043,000 bushels. Bradstreet's calls the available stock 60,831,000 bushels. Corn was firm but not active, the speculative business being only moderate and the close steady. In shipping circles, the trade was light. Provisions were very irregular. There were heavy sales. At the opening, but values fell rapidly with large transactions in all the leading articles. Towards the end of the session, the tone was more steady with the final close quite firm. Packing shows only about 50 percent of last year's cut. The chief feature of interest in the New York grain market this morning was a cable from Russia stating that crop prospects in that country were more favorable and the offerings more liberal. This information, taken in connection with the tardy response of foreign markets to our yesterday's advance, produced a more or less weak feeling among the grain trade at the opening. First sales were made at only a fractional decline from last night, but liquidation by local holders was quite free and soon resulted in a drop of 1c to 1.5c. The weather map today showed clear weather generally through the section of the country struck by the blizzard, with the thermometer ranging from 6 to 24 degrees above zero. The corn market opened at about last night's prices and shortly afterward turned easier with wheat. Trading was quiet. Oats opened dull and easier. Wire service between New York and points in the West and Northwest was working poorly this morning, and orders from these points were again much delayed. The exports of wheat and flour from both coasts for the week ended Thursday night were 3,043,632 bushels, against 3,885,000 bushels last week and 5,383,691 bushels last year; corn, 762,700 bushels, against 951,000 bushels. The closing prices were as follows: Wheat, 77c November, 77.5c December, 70.5c January, 80.5c February, 82.5c March, 84.5c May. Corn, 50.5c November, 51c December, 51c January, 63c March, and oats at 35.5c November, 36.5c December, 40.5c May.

Owing to the interruption in the telegraph service today, we are without our usual reports from several markets. The farmers' deliveries of wheat in the United Kingdom last week were 59,933 quarters at 27s 11d, against 69,533 quarters at 28s 3d the previous week.

ARCHBISHOP IRELAND WINS  
Catholics May Be Taught in Secular Schools  
The Conclave of Prelates Declares That the Parochial Experiment May Be Continued (New York Times)  

The conclave of the archbishops of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States held its last executive session yesterday at the house of Archbishop Corrigan, Madison Avenue and Fiftieth Street. After three days' deliberations, the archbishops have vouchsafed to make public the result of Wednesday afternoon's discussion in relation to the parochial versus the public school. In compliment to Archbishop Corrigan, who seems to have been on the wrong side of the question, but to have been the host of the prelates assembled, the conclave put out last night two written resolutions of an apparently ambiguous character. These resolutions really carried within themselves a triumph for the principles advocated by Archbishop Ireland. He advocated the tolerance of the public school system so long as the parents of the children taught would cause them to attend Sunday school or to receive at home tuition in their religious faith or in the principles of the same. Until now, a number of priests in the different cities of the Union have been accustomed to condemn the public schools as unholy, and to state from the pulpit that they would hold parents under the ban of mortal sin if they took the opportunity to refuse to send their children to the parochial schools and, instead, have them educated by the means provided. Archbishop Corrigan has laughed to scorn the report that the Vatican approved in any way the experiment made by Archbishop Ireland in the West in amalgamating the secular and the parochial schools. He has prophesied the condemnation by the Pope of the Faribault system, but, owing to pressure, he is one of the advocates today of the very system which he so vainly sought to condemn. Archbishop Ireland is triumphant. The resolutions which were yesterday made public read as follows: 

First: Resolved, To promote the erection of Catholic schools, so that there may be accommodation in them, if possible, for all our Catholic children, according to the decrees of the third Plenary Council of Baltimore and the decision of the Holy See. 

Second: Resolved, That as to children who at present do not attend Catholic schools, we direct, in addition, that provision be made for Sunday schools, and also, by instruction, on some other day or days of the week, and by urging parents to teach their children the Christian doctrine at their homes. Sunday and weekday schools should be under the direct supervision of the clergy, aided by the intelligent lay teachers, and, when possible, by the members of religious teaching orders. 

The first section of the body of these resolutions is simply a "sop to Cerberus." Of course, every prelate will try in his diocese to improve the condition of his parochial schools. But the public schools have had a long start ahead, and it will be some time before those of the Catholics will be in a condition to compete with them. Archbishop Ireland, in the famous and much-discussed Faribault experiment, advised that public and parochial schools in districts where the existence of one would be a detriment to the other amalgamate. In this little town in Minnesota, the experiment was tried with favorable results. The public schools had money, but no teachers; the parochial schools had experienced and well-trained teachers, but no money. By combination, the money of one was set against the experience of the other. The religious teachers consented to remove all emblems of their faith from the schoolhouse and not to refer to religious matters during school hours. The state provided the buildings, and the children of Faribault obtained the advantages of experienced teachers and cultured instructors. 

Archbishop Corrigan, leading the Eastern Archbishops, bitterly opposed any compromise between Church and State. Pope Leo XIII, whose ideas are advanced, leans somewhat toward the views of Archbishop Ireland, on whom, it is understood, he intends eventually to bestow the scarlet hat of a Cardinal. He sent to America at first Mgr. O'Connell, once president of the American college at Rome, whose opinions coincide with those of Archbishop Ireland and Cardinal Gibbons, who is opposed to the ultra-Catholicism of the Archbishop of New York. Both the Gibbons-Ireland and the O'Connell factions have powerful friends at court, with the progressive loyalty of Archbishop Corrigan, his secretary, Mgr. McDonnell, the wealthy Bishopric of Brooklyn, but Leo XIII was too clever a diplomat to estrange the American faction headed by Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland. He knew that the great West, with its almost unlimited territory and its numerous large cities, was pregnant with Catholicism and should not be discouraged in the propagation of the faith by any exhibition of even suggestive intolerance. The Pope tolerated the Faribault experiment of Archbishop Ireland and heaped honors upon the western prelate. There is no doubt that a cardinal's hat awaits "the consecrated Blizzard" of Minnesota. 

Archbishop Ireland last night refused to express any opinion upon the resolutions adopted by the American hierarchy in conclave. But the second resolution speaks for itself. It means that where before parents not sending their children to Catholic schools were condemned under pain of mortal sin for doing so, they are now "tolerated so long as they consent to teach their children Christian doctrine at home after school hours, or to send them to the catechism class at the parish church on Sundays." This means that Archbishop Ireland's Faribault experiment should be emulated in other parts of the United States in which the Church has a foothold. The public school system of the United States, instead of being condemned, is at least tolerated. Parents can send their children for secular education wherever they choose. Church and State are separated. 

Last night it was said that Mgr. Satolh and Mgr. O'Connell, who had been sent from Rome by the Holy Father to attend this conference and to examine into the school question, were closeted with Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland. It was also said that all the Southern and Western Archbishops, and even two from the East, sympathized with the views expressed by Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland at the Wednesday conclave, and the adherents of Archbishop Corrigan suffered an overwhelming defeat. With his customary diplomacy, the Archbishop of New York has gracefully bowed to the decision of the majority. The question of tolerance of secret societies is still in doubt. The conclave will meet again in Chicago next September, just a week after the holding of the Synod.

Mining Company tent of the province have incorporated Alphonse Bay; Arthur Yale, superintendent of the East end abattoirs; Ferdinand Paquird, butcher, of Montreal; Alfred Montrouil, butcher; and Guilielmo Negris, butcher, of St. Cañogna, manager of the Bank Jacques Cartier, for the purpose of carrying on a general mining business in the province of Quebec, by the name of the "North America Mining Company," with a total capital stock of $200,000.

1892-11-25: V Church, traveler for the Sanford Manufacturing Company, of Hamilton, while driving across the prairie between Lethbridge and Fort McLeod last night, lost his trail in a blizzard and was frozen to death. His body was found this morning. Mr. Church leaves a wife and three children here. He was one of Manitoba's oldest and most popular commercial travelers. The Manitoba Government will shortly issue an official proclamation that pleuropneumonia or any other disease does not exist among the Northwest cattle. Thomas Sample was found dead in a shanty on his farm near Portage la Prairie yesterday. He leaves a wife and family in Winnipeg. Mr. E. Coateworth, M.P., and Mr. Macpherson, of Toronto, had an interview with the Minister of Justice today with reference to the formation of a mutual benefit association for the insurance of the lives of postmen throughout the Dominion. Suit was entered in the Exchequer Court today against the Government by Mr. William Hawkins Bell, of Harvey Township, Peterborough County, who claims $3,000 for alleged damages through his sawmill at Buckhorn Rapids being stopped, owing to the work of construction in connection with the Trent Valley Canal. Senator Sanford, of Hamilton, was here today on departmental business and returned home tonight. This afternoon he received a telegram stating that one of his travelers named Church, who has been employed by the firm nearly twenty years, was frozen to death yesterday near Fort MacLeod. No particulars were given, but it is supposed he was caught in a blizzard. The Department of Customs was today asked by the captain of the American steamer Otego for permission to relieve the steamer Mononcello, ashore near Sarnia. Permission was given. Information was also received that the American schooner Onaping was ashore near Port Dover, and a message was sent to the Collector of Customs at Port Dover to permit the necessary assistance to be given to the schooner. Premier Davie, of British Columbia, left for Toronto tonight and will leave there for Winnipeg tomorrow. He has telegraphed Hon. Mr. Daly asking him not to leave Winnipeg on Saturday, as he had intended, but to wait another day so that Mr. Davie may meet him and have a final talk about the railway lands. Here is the corrected text:

In British Columbia, should Mr. Daly assent, it will delay his return to Ottawa until Wednesday or Thursday. It is understood that there are a large number of applications for the position of accountant of the House of Commons. Amongst them is Mr.

18921126: THE SOLITARY GIRL by Archie Lairbaim. They sat together on the dock and chatted in a sheltered corner which he had found, and the American girl who had looked askance at her during the first two days of the Arcadia's passage across the Atlantic reckoned that the "Solitary Girl" had found a man. One of them even averred that she had seen the process of self-introduction take place, that "Steely Eyes" had enquired whether the "Solitary Girl" minded tobacco smoke, after carefully placing himself in a position where, owing to the strong westerly breeze, it was impossible that she should inhale it. She had answered in the negative, "You bet your sweet life," and the ice thus broken, they had drifted into conversation. That she should have earned so soon after leaving Queenstown harbor the title of the "Solitary Girl" argued no very surprising gift of observation or ingenuity on the part of the young ladies returning to their beloved States who had criticized her in her loneliness. They had assigned her a nickname as they had to the man beside her, and she was as unconscious of it and of the interest others took in her as she had been of the clear gray eyes which had followed her at intervals since she had first appeared on deck until the owner of them addressed her. He had been so perfectly respectful in his manner, had seemed so absolutely indifferent whether she spoke to him or not when he occasionally made a trivial remark as he sat near her that she felt no need to retreat as she had done hitherto when others, either men or women, had shown signs of desiring her acquaintance. An hour later when someone claimed the deck chair on which she was sitting and he had offered to lend her one of his, she accepted it with a friendly smile. "I have not got one," she explained, "we started in such a hurry." "Then you are not traveling alone?" he asked. "No, my father is on board, but he is too bad a sailor to appear yet." He walked off hardly waiting for her to finish her reply, brought the chair, and arranged it with the one he had occupied. "I was expecting a friend on board at Queenstown, and had brought one for him," he remarked, "but his train was delayed and he missed the boat." "It's a bad train that does nobody any good," she answered with another smile, sinking back restfully as if not afraid of being disturbed again, and before they parted at dinner time he tied a label to it with her name upon it in pencil. "How did you know my name was Hamilton?" she asked. "The purser told me," he said. "I think he has moved me to your table. I asked him to do so. My name is Fletcher. John Fletcher." And that evening, instead of sitting solitary next to the empty seat which her father should have occupied, Miss Hamilton talked almost cheerfully to Mr. Fletcher, and a man who had vainly tried to find a topic to interest her the evening before found a friend with a knowledge of hides equal to his own at another table. "He's an elegant man," said Miss Loria Luck of New York, "what can he find to like in her? That's what beats me." And Miss Geraldine van Hooten answered, "Dollars," founding her theory on the fact that Miss Hamilton's father was occupying the best "stateroom" in the ship alone, and that he had not yet condescended to appear on deck and mix with his fellow travelers. "Or perhaps he's noble," she said speculatively. And Miss van Hooten endorsed her friend's opinion that Mr. Fletcher was "elegant." As they had applied the term indiscriminately to the big rollers the Arcadia had encountered out of Queenstown harbor, to the furniture of the saloon, and to a shoal of porpoises, there was nothing startling in their applying it to a tall singular young man, with a determined jaw and a black mustache dividing his face with a line as straight as a ruler over what seemed to be a rather thin pair of lips. An elegant man in the ordinary plain British acceptation of the term he certainly was not, whatever Miss Loria Luck may have said and Miss Hamilton may have thought, and Miss Hamilton's eyes showed that she thought well of him. "She's mean to keep him to herself like that," said Miss Luck one afternoon; "she looks at him when he comes on deck till he turns and she catches his eye, and if he does not come and plant himself down by her right away, she'll look at him till he does, and when he sits down she has nothing to say." There may have been some truth in Miss Luck's remarks. She had a quick eye, and possibly Mr. Fletcher was himself feeling that he was extracting much amusement from Miss Hamilton's conversation. He was leaning back in his chair, looking at her from under his half-closed eyelids. "So your father is going to leave the old country and settle in America?" he said slowly. "Not leaving his country for his country's good, I hope?" he added with a half-laugh. It was the fourth time that afternoon that he had mentioned her father's name; three times she had turned the conversation to other subjects, and now she was looking seaward, silent and with her cheeks crimson. He must have been a quick-witted man though, to notice the effect of his speech and jump to the conclusion which he did. "Forgive me," he said, bending forward and speaking earnestly, "forgive me, Miss Hamilton, if I have said anything to hurt you; you know me very slightly, but well enough, I hope, to know I would not have done so willingly." "Many a true word is spoken in jest," she said, half to herself, moving as if she would rise from her chair; but he touched her arm and she sat down again. "I must have your forgiveness for what I said," he insisted, "you know I would not betray any confidence, why should I? Who am I that I should do so? I would do anything rather than offend you. What can I say? Stay, you see that man?" He was pointing to a fair little red-faced man who was diligently trying to obtain an appetite for dinner by pacing the deck. Miss Hamilton nodded. She had turned pale from red, and the lonely, frightened look had come back to her eyes. She looked at the little man indifferently. "He said he was at school with you, and he called you by some other name when he came up and spoke to you," she said. Mr. Fletcher was looking at the little man with an expression that was not exactly benevolent. "He called me by a name that was not Fletcher, Miss Hamilton, and I'm not quite sure that he was not right; so you see that I have a claim on your indulgence, almost on your confidence." But whatever Mr. Fletcher may have expected Miss Hamilton to say, she said nothing then. The afternoon had grown colder and the horizon was full of damp mist. She pulled her cloak tightly around her with one hand, and with the finger rested restlessly on the arm of the chair on which she sat. Mr. Fletcher looked annoyed; he moved his chair a little closer to hers and glanced rather nervously at the small, well-gloved hand as it rested for a moment on the chair arm nearest to him. He had never been at a loss for words before in her society; he must have been conscious that he had done most of the talking during their acquaintance, that on trivial topics he had found a flow of conversation which had amused her, and that when he had touched more serious subjects he had secured her interest, or even drawn her into argument, and yet he sat silent for ten whole minutes looking at her. Miss Loria Luck grew impatient; she could see them from where she sat and she let her book drop on her knees to watch. "I believe they've quarreled," she said to herself, and then more loudly, "Mr. Smith!" The fat little man who was pounding the deck for the good of his health paused and bowed. "I shall be much obliged if you will allow me to join you in your constitutional," said Miss Luck, and as she took his arm and paced the deck with him, she confided to him with characteristic candor that she suffered from dyspepsia. "Too much iced water," said Mr. Smith sympathetically. And having found a topic interesting to both of them, they fell to discussing the comparative merits of a British and an American dietary. "Keep this side of the dock," said Miss Luck; "there's a perfect blizzard the other side of the smokestack." In the warm shelter to be found in the neighborhood of the tunnel, Miss Luck lingered; in the more exposed portions of the deck she raced Mr. Smith along till he was almost out of breath. "Nice comfortable place your friend 'Steely Eyes' has chosen," she said to the companion who was trotting to keep up with one of her fastest spurts. But Mr. Smith did not know whom she meant. "Mr. Fletcher," she explained; "he has been sitting there all the afternoon with Miss Hamilton." But Mr. Smith denied all acquaintance with Mr. Fletcher. "But I've seen you speaking to him twice," said Miss Luck; "twice since we came on board; once when you spoke to him on deck and held out your hand and he turned his back on you, and once after that, late one night when you were talking together like old friends in the smoke-room. I looked in as I walked by the door." "Your bright eyes see everything, Miss Luck," protested Mr. Smith. "There are no flies on Lolie," said Miss Luck, gracefully acknowledging the compliment; but refusing to be put off by it, she added, impatiently, "Who is Mr. Fletcher, anyway?" "I don't know," said Mr. Smith, and added, "I am afraid you are catching cold." But it was incredulity, not catarrh, which caused Miss Luck to sniff, and she made no further rejoinder. The fog had thickened, the steam foghorn was beginning to boom over their heads with the groan of a distracted mammoth, but Miss Luck, holding Mr. Smith's arm, continued to tramp the deck. She was rewarded in time for her patience, if Mr. Smith had the right to judge from the tightening grip of her fingers and the thrill of excitement in her tone as she whispered, "Look as we go by this time; he is holding her hand!" Mr. Smith was a bashful man and a discreet one. To his honor be it said, he did not look. He tried, on the contrary, to restrain his companion from going near them where they sat. "They will not mind us," said Miss Luck in a tone of conviction. And she was right to the extent that it was not her presence which caused Mr. Fletcher to straighten himself in his chair, while a slight cloud of impatience crossed his face. A tall, elderly man, wrapped in a thick ulster with the collar turned up round his throat, had come and stood behind them and said in a tentative voice, as if not quite sure of her identity, "Edith," and then in an imperious, impatient tone as she turned her head, "Edith, I have been looking for you everywhere." "Yes, father," said Miss Hamilton, quietly. She had naturally a quiet, low-pitched voice; when she spoke to her father it seemed almost suppressed. She said a few words to him as Mr. Fletcher rose and stood by with his self-possessed angular air and a slight look of expectancy. "My goodness!" said Miss Luck to her friend Miss van Hooten as they settled into their places at dinner half an hour later, "I saw something this afternoon. The 'Solitary Girl' has introduced 'Steely Eyes' to her papa."

1892-12-08: Not only freshmen theatricals, but also that the freshmen glee and banjo clubs give no concerts. Shutting off these latter organizations, the faculty has taken away the last financial means of the freshmen crew, as the proceeds of the spring concert go to the crew. Found the Roundsman Guilty. New York, December 7: The jury in the case of Roundsman Matthew V. Daly, who was on trial for assault in the third degree in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, returned a verdict this morning, finding the policeman guilty as charged in the indictment, with a strong recommendation to mercy. Daly was charged with assaulting Mrs. Annie Hannan, who had accused him of outraging her daughter. The St. Mary's Canal Traffic. Bay City, Mich., December 7: St. Mary's Falls canal closed today after the greatest season in its history. The freight which passed through this year reached 11,241,000 tons, an increase of 2,325,000 tons over last year. Every important article of commerce shows an enormous increase: Grain increased 11 percent, flour 41 percent, and iron ore 18 percent. A Nebraska Storm.

1892-12-09: GOVERNMENT INTENTIONS. The Anarchist Brought to Paris. Mrs. Maybrick's Case. More Trouble Pending in South America. Tambo, December 8: The L'Abre Parole says that M. Léon Bourgeois, Minister of Justice, has ordered the immediate arrest of the members of the council of the Panama Canal Company, who are charged with breach of trust. The members of the company under indictment are Ferdinand de Lesseps, chairman of the board of directors; Charles de Lesseps, vice-chairman; and M. Fontanes and Baron Coltu, directors. The Chamber of Deputies, by a vote of 432 to 81, adopted a motion declaring urgency for the consideration of M. Hamel's motion authorizing holders of Panama Canal bonds to form a syndicate to prosecute the persons who misappropriated the company's funds. The Ministerial Declaration. The declaration of the new ministry was read in the Chamber today. It recalled the events that caused the recent political crisis and affirmed the intention of the cabinet to aid the Chamber of Deputies by every means in its power to shed light upon the Panama Canal affair. The government will affirm the principle of separation of the executive, legislative, and judicial powers. The government had decided not to exceed the limits prescribed by law. The Chamber is requested to devote its attention to reforms in taxation. The Chamber, by a vote of 306 to 104, adopted a resolution declaring confidence in the government. A Lot More to Be Held. The Standard's Paris correspondent says: "It is stated that Minister of Justice Bourgeois has confirmed the order for the post mortem of Baron de Reinach's body. If M. Ribot repeals the non-possumus of Bicard and Loubot respecting the legal powers of the Panama Canal Investigating Committee, there will be a demand for a dissolution, or a presidential crisis will be inevitable." Trouble in Prospect. Valparaiso, December 8: A correspondent on the Uruguayan-Brazilian frontier says it is certain that the Federals in Rio Grande do Sul have large resources in arms and men, and that serious trouble may be expected. Already there have been some outbreaks. At Arijas, the entire Third Regiment of Cavalry revolted, cut the telegraph lines, and are sacking commercial houses and killing Republicans. Skirmishing is going on in a desultory way in various parts of the state of Rio Grande. The chiefs of the Federal movement have, it is said, 10,000 men fully armed. Their commissary is in good condition, and they have plenty of money. Uruguayans along the frontier are joining their ranks and have brought with them 8,000 Mannlicher rifles. The Uruguayan Government has 1,000 men guarding the frontier. The Republicans hold Santa Anna with a regiment of infantry, two batteries of artillery, and a squadron of cavalry. The locality of the troops is, however, doubted. How Much of this is True? London, December 8: Mrs. Maybrick is critically ill in Woking prison. On Tuesday, the governor of the prison summoned the Baroness de Rogues, Mrs. Maybrick's mother, from Rouen, and she arrived yesterday and proceeded at once to the prison. It was thought Mrs. Maybrick was dying, and the sacrament was administered to her. She made the last confession of a dying prisoner, which, in case of death, is legally attested and given to the prisoner's next of kin. Mrs. Maybrick swears she was innocent of moral intent or deed and act against the life of James Maybrick. The Baroness de Rogues was only allowed to see her daughter for a short time. Mrs. Maybrick had several hemorrhages of the lungs, which left her so weak that if they occur again, she will surely die. She has been suffering from these hemorrhages for six weeks. She has petitioned Mr. Herbert Asquith, the Home Secretary, to release her from prison before her disease becomes incurable. Home Secretary Asquith states that the condition of Mrs. Maybrick is receiving serious consideration at the Home Office. War Have Paid Dearly. London, December 8: The Times' Berlin correspondent says: "The Bundesrat, in modifying the duties on alcohol in Count von Caprivi's bills, intended to meet the army increase, makes a concession to the great landowners, a fact which indicates that the Government has abandoned hope of coming to terms with the advanced Liberals and the Radicals. Even the National Liberals are now pleased, and the Government may find that it has purchased the Conservative support dearly." What Chile Thought of It. Valparaiso, December 8: La Union, of Valparaiso, in commenting on President Harrison's message regarding relations with Chile, says he is much mistaken in thinking that Chile in any way recognizes either Mr. Harrison, his cabinet, or Minister Egan as friends. In paying the Baltimore indemnity and signing the protocol, Chile was actuated by good feeling towards the large majority of people in the United States, whose sympathy with her during the revolution was earnest. The Snowstorm in Europe. Vienna, December 8: There is little snow here, but a terrible wind has done much damage in this vicinity and caused many accidents. Budapest is almost lifeless as a result of the snowfall. Nobody goes out of doors unless compelled to do so. Not a single train left yesterday from the eastern and western termini. Northern trains still run, but they are hours late. The telegraph and telephone services are greatly crippled. Anarchist Francois. London, December 8: Francois, the Anarchist, who blew up Very's restaurant in Paris and killed a number of people, was taken to France for trial last night. Paris, December 8: The Anarchist Francois was arraigned before a magistrate today. He denied his complicity in the Café Very outrage. The Kaiser as a Naval Designer. Berlin, December 8: The Kaiser has designed a warship of which a model has been constructed. In this, several innovations are made in naval architecture. To ensure the health of officers and men, the sleeping apartments are above deck, but in case of battle, they can be removed in a few minutes. Thinks It Was Bad Weather. London, December 8: The Marquis of Huntley, in a letter to The Times on the agricultural depression, expresses the belief that it is mainly due to bad seasons. Protection, he says, does not benefit the farmers. If so, he asks, how is it that the distress is the same in protected countries? To Invalidate His Election. Berlin, December 8: Steps are being taken to invalidate Rector Ahlwardt's election to the Reichstag on the ground of corruption and intimidation of opponents. Several of his supporters maltreated a Radical agent suspected of being a Jew. He was badly injured and was obliged to use a revolver to escape from the mob. No Protection for Them. London, December 9: The Ultimatum Madrid correspondent says that he understands that Premier Sagasta will reverse the protection policy of the Canovas Cabinet as far as possible, by treaties of commerce with the United States and European countries. Surprised Everybody. London, December 8: The unanimity and fervid enthusiasm displayed at the agricultural conference, which met in St. James' Hall here yesterday, in favor of protection and bi-metallism, have alike astonished the Conservatives and Liberals. Death of an Artist. London, December 8: A dispatch from Boulogne-sur-Mer reports the death of an English artist named Brockman, from the effect of a blow received during a quarrel with a compatriot, De Gacher, who has been arrested. Austria's Army Increase. Vienna, December 8: The Army Gazette announces an addition of 3,000 on the peace standard of the army. This indicates that the Emperor is disposed to follow the policy of the German Emperor. Her Royalty III. London, December 8: Mr. Herbert Spencer is seriously ill. Vienna, December 8: Von Suppe, the composer, is dangerously ill. The Spree's Passengers. London, December 8: The steamer Havel sailed from Queenstown for New York today with the passengers and cargo of the disabled steamer Spree. COAL MINE ON FIRE. The Drummond Pit Ablaze. No More Injury Anticipated. New Glasgow, December 8: The town was startled this morning by a report that the Drummond colliery was on fire. It is the property of the Intercolonial Coal Company and has been exceptionally well worked lately, with the output largely increased. Inquiry, however, shows that as yet there have been no lives lost and comparatively little injury done. The fire is in a tunnel connecting the main workings with a disused pit, popularly known as the "Stinking Willie" pit, and is as yet some considerable distance from the nearest spot where the men are at work. The plan being taken to put out the fire is likely to prove successful. A heavy stone wall is being built across the mouth of the tunnel, shutting it off from the main passage. Air being thus excluded, it is hoped it will soon burn itself out. No serious danger is as yet anticipated, and the men are at work as usual, and the horses have not been removed. How the fire originated is a mystery. "THE STORM SWEPT WEST." An Old-Fashioned Blizzard. The Texas Cyclone. HOUSTON, Kas., December 8: A typical Kansas blizzard has raged here. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

---

For 13 hours trains are from 12 to 24 hours late; freight trains are snowed up along the lines. The Rock Island, Denver limited, is lost between here and Fairbury. The snow extends into Oklahoma, and reports of terrible suffering among the settlers are coming in. The loss of stock will be great. 

Denison, Texas, December 8. The cyclone of Tuesday evening caused no fatalities in this section, but the destruction of property was great. A cattleman named Wiesmar, while riding over a prairie, was killed by a bolt of lightning. 

Brenham, Texas, December 8. Tuesday's cyclone near this city demolished everything in its path. Several persons were seriously injured. Many families are homeless and utterly destitute. 

Pahokee, Ark., December 8. A heavy windstorm struck this town Tuesday and caused damage to the amount of $50,000. Twenty-six buildings were wrecked. Several persons were seriously injured.

SLOWLY GROWING COLDER, And There May Be a Slight Fall of Snow or So: Toronto, December 8, 11 p.m. The storm that was central over Lower Michigan yesterday is central tonight over the Upper Ottawa. It is now dispersing. Unsettled weather and local falls of sleet or rain have fallen over Ontario and Quebec. In the Maritime provinces, it is raining. In the Northwest, fine weather with temperatures near zero and higher pressure prevails. 

Minimum and maximum temperatures: Calgary, 12, 20; Edmonton, 10, 20; Qu'Appelle, 2, 8; Winnipeg, 10, 10; Port Arthur, 18, 24; Toronto, 37, 42; Kingston, 30, 48; Montreal, 28, 40; Quebec, 20, 28; Halifax, 28, 42. 

Upper St. Lawrence: Westerly winds become local falls of sleet or rain; becoming slowly colder. 

There is strong opposition to President Harrison's suggestions that the international traffic between Canada and the United States should be legally hampered. They have had an eighteen-hour blizzard down in Kansas, and all the trains are stuck in the snow. Mr. Blake's paradise for Canada's farmers was located in this state. If any of the deluded people who went there trusting in his word hear of the open weather Canada is enjoying, how mad they will be! 

The Marquis of Huntly thinks the agricultural distress in England is due to bad seasons. The low price and abundance of farm produce in the world's markets would rather indicate that it is due to good seasons. The Texan silver mine people have formulated a demand that the United States shall coin all the silver brought to its mint. They represent a monetary conference that has influence. There are votes behind their platform.

1892-12-26: HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT. Washington officials don't know about the Canal scheme. Washington, December 24. Officials of the State Department have no information regarding the application of the International Navigation Company to the Canadian Parliament for a charter authorizing the company to connect Lake Erie with Montreal and New York by a system of canals, the Hudson River, and the St. Lawrence and Richelieu rivers and Lake Champlain. 

The telegram from Ottawa making the announcement that an application had been filed is not definite enough to afford a clear idea of the scope of the proposed scheme. Government officials said that by this scheme it was intended to secure the navigation of the Hudson by Canadian vessels; the promoters would doubtless be disappointed. That stream would no more be free to vessels from the North reaching it through canals than it is at present to vessels from the West via the Erie canals. Foreign vessels will be stopped at the end of the canal route, as now.

A BLIZZARD IN KILLING STOCK AND BLOCKING UP HALL MAY OUT. Kansas City, Mo., December 25. Kansas, Oklahoma, and the West generally are experiencing a genuine blizzard today, which threatens not only to block railroads but also to do great damage to stock. Last night, a drizzling rain began which continued almost to daylight, when it gave way to driving snow, and the wind having in the meantime shifted to the northeast, the temperature grew many degrees colder. The snow kept up all day, and before night it had developed into a regular blizzard. Several inches of snow fell and drifted badly. Scattering reports from Kansas and the southwest generally show that the railroads are in trouble from the drifted snow in the cuts.

1892-12-27: OUT OF A JOB. Hint is how some of the extra clerks at Ottawa will begin the year. (From our own correspondent.) Ottawa, December 20. The thirty-nine extra clerks in the Department of Railways and Canals, who have received notice that their services will not be required after the end of the year, got a little Christmas present at Saturday's meeting of the Council in the shape of a gratuity equal to two months' salary, but it is understood that the hopes of reinstatement entertained by some of them will not be fulfilled, as the work at the department has so much decreased that in future it will be done entirely by the permanent staff. 

In the Public Works Department also, a considerable reduction of the number of extra clerks is said to be contemplated, and about a dozen have either received notice or will do so shortly. There are over one hundred extra clerks in this department who have not passed the Civil Service examination. A huge number of these are architects or engineers, who do not require to pass the examination, and many others were employed prior to 1882 and are specially exempted by the Civil Service Act, but of the others, it is most likely that there will be a considerable weeding out.

COLD WEATHER. It is met with both at sea and on the land. New York, December 26. Incoming steamships report fierce storms and bitter cold weather at sea. Every vessel that came into port today was a mass of ice from waterline to masthead. Several steamships had deck work smashed, and members of the crews were frostbitten. The tramp steamer Lauristan, from Bremen, December 3, came in with deck and side covered with ice two feet thick in places and with huge icicles hanging from her yards. Her captain says the weather was so severe that all three of the ship's compasses froze in the alcohol box, and he was obliged to make his course by the stars. 

Davenport, IA, December 26. In exposed places, the mercury dropped to 12 below this morning. This afternoon, persons were crossing the Mississippi on foot, and tonight the ice bridge will hold. 

Bellair, Ohio, December 20. The Ohio River at this place is frozen over for the first time since 1885. 

Amsterdam, N.Y., December 20. The weather in the Mohawk Valley today is the coldest of the season. At 7 a.m., it was 6 degrees below zero and 14 below in Gloversville. The mercury is at zero tonight along the valley, and there is little snow. 

Kansas City, December 20. A typical blizzard began forming in this locality last night, and at 3 o'clock this morning had fully materialized, the mercury at that time having fallen to six degrees below zero. The blizzard was preceded by considerable snow and accompanied by the usual biting north wind. The storm is far-reaching, extending over the entire southwest, and is particularly severe in Kansas. In this city, the thermometer marked 4 degrees below zero at 10 o'clock this morning.

FROM THE ANCIENT CAPITAL. Quebec. People are finding it cold. Personal Intelligence, from our own correspondent. Quebec, December 20. The weather has been excessively cold for the past four days, and today it is worse than ever, and a gale of wind is blowing. Any number of people have been frostbitten, but no very serious cases are reported. Mr. Louis H. Tache, formerly private secretary to the Hon. Mr. Chapleau, has been appointed extra.

A B CASH. The voyage of the derelict American ship "While" is recorded in the hydrographic office as one of the remarkable cases in the history of navigation. Her cruise came to a close on January 23, 1889, when she stranded on one of the islands of the Hebrides. The "While" was one of the many vessels wrecked or abandoned during the great blizzard of March 1888, when so many persons lost their lives at sea or ashore. During the blizzard, it was estimated that 138 vessels were blown ashore, sunk, or damaged along the coast of the United States north of Hatteras. Off the coast west of the fortieth meridian, some twenty vessels were sunk or abandoned, among them the "While." 

She was a three-masted schooner, lumber laden. She sailed from Delaware Bay on March 13, 1888. She started off southward, and under the influence of the inshore current and the northwest gale, with her sails and ensign set, reaching the Gulf Stream, she turned to the eastward and commenced her long voyage towards Europe directly in the track of thousands of vessels engaged in transatlantic commerce, drifting about at the mercy of wind and current. She traveled north-northeast at the rate of about 15 miles a day until she reached latitude 44 north, longitude 33 west, when she began a remarkable zigzag performance, which lasted from the beginning of May to the end of October. 

She landed in latitude 51 north, longitude 44 west, whence she moved east and northward 1,200 miles in eighty-four days, or at the rate of about fifteen miles a day. During her summer zigzag, she was directly in the highway of the greatest ocean commerce, and, tossed about by the winds and drifted this way and that by the Gulf Stream and the Labrador current, she was a constant menace to navigation. During those six months, she was reported by thirty-six vessels, three of which sighted her in one day. 

In her range of ten months and ten days, she traveled more than 6,000 miles and was reported forty-five times. How many more vessels passed dangerously near to her at night and in thick weather it is impossible to estimate. The name of the "While" was called to the attention of mariners in a special supplement to the Pilot Chart for February 1890, prepared by Mr. Hayden with a view to impressing upon the masters of vessels and others the necessity of reporting to the Hydrographic Office all facts connected with derelicts that might come to their knowledge, as the Pilot Chart is the only publication which disseminates this valuable information. An idea of its importance to mariners may be gained by Lieutenant Hayden's statement that the number of derelicts reported in the North Atlantic alone ranges from 25 to 45 every month since then. 

Another remarkable derelict was the ship "Oriflamme," which was abandoned on fire in June 1881. On the 24th of the following October, the steamship "Iron Gate," on a voyage from Adelaide, Australia, to Portland, Oregon, passed an iron ship apparently burned. On the 12th of February following, the hull of an iron ship, laden with coal and iron, drifted ashore on the Island of Karoia, one of the Paumotu or low Archipelago. She was visited by some natives, who brought away a small bell, on which was engraved "Oriflamme, 1865." She was completely burned out, and in a short time sank in deep water. She had drifted 2,840 miles in about eight months. 

The abandoned schooner "Twenty-One Friends" drifted a greater distance in about the same time. She was reported on March 24, 1885, 100 miles off the Capes of Chesapeake Bay. The Gulf Stream carried her east-northeast for about four and a half months, covering 2,130 miles. Thence she drifted in an easterly and southeasterly direction toward the northern coast of Spain and was last reported on December 4 of the same year about 130 miles from Cape Finisterre. Total distance traveled: 3,525 miles; time: 8 months and 10 days. She was reported in all twenty-two times, which shows how dangerous such derelicts can be. Here is the corrected text:

A derelict is in the North Atlantic. One of the mysteries of the seas was the case of the derelict Marie Celeste, a barque found in the Mediterranean, under full sail, with every rope in place. Her captain and crew had disappeared, and nothing is known of them to this day. She was taken into port and restored to her owners.

1892-12-28: C, December 27. A blizzard struck Charleston this morning, and for the first time within the past fifteen years, rooftops were covered in a thin coating of snow and sleet. The mercury averaged about three or four degrees below freezing point during the day, and pedestrians, not being accustomed to ice, had a hard time getting along the sidewalks. The orange trees in the city are injured somewhat and will probably bear only one crop this year. Fort Monroe, Va., December 27. The worst blizzard in twenty years struck this vicinity about midnight, and the snow has been falling ever since. The electric car line to Hampton is blocked, and navigation is suspended.

1892-12-29: Where is the Steamer Umbria and her six hundred souls? This is causing much anxiety. Nothing but conjecture. The most probable theory is that she has encountered rough seas. New York, December 28. Conjecture as to what has happened to the long overdue Cunard liner Umbria is all that can be indulged in. That she has met with an accident is agreed in shipping circles, but just the nature, extent, and seriousness of that mishap will not be known until she is spoken by some ship or until she arrives. At midnight, the Umbria was five days overdue, not a word having been heard from her since she was sighted off Tascott Light, outward bound 11 days ago. Late yesterday afternoon, Mr. Brown was seen by a reporter, and after declaring that he was not at all alarmed over the non-arrival of the Umbria, he said that all Atlantic vessels that had been caught in the prevailing ocean blizzard had been overdue. The Umbria is under the command of Capt. Horatio McKay, vice-commodore of the Cunard fleet, and one of the most careful commanders about. The Cunard people had every confidence in his ability and discretion and were satisfied that the Umbria could not be in better hands. The Umbria was built and engined in the famous Fairfield yard at Govan, on the Clyde, in 1884. She was designed both for speed and comfort. At the time she was launched, she was the largest steamship afloat except the Great Eastern, and she was the most powerful without any exception. She is a sister ship of the Etruria and is the swiftest single-screw steamship in the world. She is 501.6 feet in length, 57.2 feet broad, and 38.2 feet deep, with 3,245 net tonnage and 7,718 gross tonnage. She is wider, deeper, and shorter than the ordinary ocean greyhound, and thus has greater steadiness. Her boilers are all "double-ended," that is, they are provided with a set of furnaces at each end. The flame passes to a chamber in the center, returns through the tubes, and passes thence to the funnels. The latter are of large diameter but are of ordinary length. The engines are extremely powerful. The central high-pressure cylinder is 71 inches in diameter, and the two low-pressure cylinders are each 105 inches. They have a sufficient stroke and turn a screw of manganese bronze of great accuracy of pitch. The Umbria is provided throughout with transverse bulkheads, or watertight compartments, and the engine room is surrounded with bulkheads. If she has met with any serious accident, she would remain afloat as long as any of those compartments remained intact. On her present trip, the Umbria has 130 first cabin, 123 second, and 120 steerage passengers. The officers and crew number 225. The Umbria holds the eastward record of 1 day, 1 hour, and 15 minutes made in September of this month. Her shortest westward passage was made last August when she crossed in 9 days, 22 hours, and 7 minutes. Schooners Wrecked, Halifax, N.S., December 23. The schooner Flora Dell, of Northeast Harbor, Shelburne, from Cape Negro, bound to Halifax, ran ashore at Moose Harbour last night and will probably be a total loss. She has a cargo of herring. The schooner Willie Craig, Capt. Palmer, from Cape Breton, bound for Halifax, is reported wrecked at Little Harbor, near Ship Harbor. She was built in Pugwash in 1862 and is owned by Edward Macpherson of this city.

1892-12-31: McEntyre & Son, Importers and Tailors. Latest patterns in fine English Woollens for Suiting and Overcoatings. 53 Beaver Hall. Tornado Tom: He was tough, but his heart was in the right place. Blizzard Pen: That so? Tornado Tom: Yes, I shot for the place where it ought to be, and by gum, it was right there!

1893-01-11: London, January 10. A severe storm is raging throughout Western Ontario, and all railway lines are blocked, and trains from the West have lost hours in finding their way through. The streetcar company put a gang of men on early, and though they managed to get the tracks uncovered, the cars are running regardless of the timetable. The storm is not merely local, as trains from all directions are either blockaded or far behind time. No trains on the Grand Trunk Railway had arrived up to 11 o'clock this afternoon from the west, although one was waiting at Komoka until the track was cleared. Two locomotives were placed on every outgoing train. The snowplows were sent out early along the different lines and did good work. Fifty men from the car shops were placed at work shoveling in the yards, which were almost impassable, as many as four locomotives pulling one train. The Canadian Pacific Railway express, due from the East at 4 a.m., arrived at noon, and others are timed in proportion. Altogether, railroad men pronounce it the worst they have had for years. The thermometer registered 2 degrees below zero at noon, and the intense cold adds to the general discomfort. Skaroft, Ont., January 10. The storm of yesterday has culminated in a complete blizzard. Tonight's trains from Goderich were two to three hours late, and freight trains were canceled. The weather is intensely cold, and if the storm continues until morning, all traffic, both on the country highways and the railway, will be blockaded. The cold in the Neanon, Owen Sound, Ont., January 10. Last night was the coldest of the season here, the thermometer marking 10 degrees below zero. Cornwall, Ont., January 10. A blizzard has been blowing here for the past three days. The roads are blocked in all directions. The railway is running, but trains are delayed by heavy drifts in the cuttings. This is the worst storm that has been experienced here in many years. Paris, Ont., January 10. It was 21 degrees below zero here last night, with a strong northerly wind. This is the coldest experienced here this season. The snow is three feet deep, and the winter so far is the most severe for many years. Mattawa, Ont., January 10. Stormy weather; thermometer, 10 below. Buckingham, Que., January 10. Cloudy, with light sprinkling of snow; temperature, 7 above. Deschenes, Ont., January 10. The thermometer registered 22 degrees below zero here last night, the coldest that has been experienced here for some time. The trains are all reported very late. Streator, Ont., January 10. The thermometer registered 15 degrees below zero here this morning. All the morning trains were about two hours late on account of a heavy snowfall and drifts. Noville, below at Mornin, Sarnia, Ont., January 10. The weather here for the past twenty-four hours has been the coldest experienced in years. During last night, the thermometer registered 17 degrees below zero. Last night about seven o'clock, the ferry Conger got blocked in the ice and was detained there until seven this morning. Many Sarnia people were aboard but got off this morning, walking ashore on the ice. All the mail and other trains are many hours late. Lindsay, Ont., January 10. The thermometer this morning registered about 25 degrees below zero, with a strong northwest wind blowing. Caledon Black, Ont., January 10. Turning colder; ton and a half below zero now. Benshew, Ont., January 10. Fifteen below zero at noon today, strong westerly winds and drifting badly. Maniwaki, Ont., January 10. A strong westerly wind, with thermometer 8 below at 2 p.m. Roads are becoming badly drifted; six inches of snow since last night and this morning. Montmorency, Que., January 10. Strong east wind, with some snow; thermometer 2 below. Barrie, Ont., January 10. The weather today is the coldest in years, the thermometer registering 25 degrees below zero. A strong north wind has been blowing since last night, causing railway traffic to be interrupted. Toronto, January 10. At 1 o'clock, a thermometer at the corner of King and Yonge streets registered 9 degrees below zero. At 8 o'clock this morning, it was 12 below.

1893-01-19: The Reign of Jack Frost. Great suffering caused in Europe by intense cold. The wolves driven out of the forests into the villages. The mercury freezes in Northern Michigan. Memphis, January 18. The cold throughout Europe continues to be intense. In this city, the cold is very severe, being 23 degrees Fahrenheit. There is great suffering and a large fatality among the poor, owing partly to the cold and partly to acute destitution among the laboring classes. The bodies of three persons who had been frozen to death were found in the streets today, and numerous instances are reported of people being frostbitten. Navigation is being suspended on the Elbe, and Hamburg ship owners have ordered their vessels to proceed to other ports, steamers from South America being sent to Bremen Haven. Horrible stories come from the remoter regions of Europe, and especially the Balkans, of death and suffering caused by the severity of the winter. In Serbia, the wolves have abandoned the forests and prowl about the towns and villages in search of prey. A young girl was devoured by wolves in the suburbs of Belgrade, and the animals, made more ferocious than ever by hunger, have actually appeared in the streets of the city. In Montenegro, packs of wolves have attempted to enter the sheepfolds, refusing to retreat when fired upon by the peasantry. Despatches from Russia state that there is great suffering in the provinces where the famine prevailed last year, the people having been so much weakened by their sufferings as to make insufficient provision of food and fuel for the winter. In Russia, also, the wild animals, made desperate by hunger and cold, have invaded the villages and devoured both human beings and domestic animals. Rome, January 18. In Venice, the ingredients are frozen, and the canals are filling with ice and snow. Provisions are at a premium. The thermometer shows 16 degrees below zero centigrade. In Vienna, the thermometer stands at 20 degrees below zero centigrade; in Padua, 11 degrees; Stockholm, January 18. Intense cold prevails throughout Sweden. In the north, the mercury freezes. All harbors are ice-bound. Steamers due from London and Hull on Saturday have not arrived yet. Memphis, Tenn., January 18. A blizzard struck Memphis last evening. At 11 o'clock, the snow was eleven inches deep on the level and in drifts two and three feet deep. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed while preserving the original meaning and formatting as much as possible:

Cars are blockaded and traffic suspended. St. Louis, January 18. Teams and wagons are now crossing the Mississippi River on the ice bridge. This is the first time in several years that teams have crossed the river on ice.

1893-02-01: J. Auston Chamberlain, the Unionist, drove up to the House at an early hour in a cab. The young Unionist brought with him in the cab a store of silk ham which he rapidly deposited on the third bench below the gangway on the Government side, thus securing these places for the Liberal-Unionists. The crowd outside the House was small throughout the morning hour, but increased towards midday. Prominent members of Parliament were, as usual, hissed or applauded, according to the sentiments of the spectators toward them. 

The Speech from the Throne: The following was the Queen's speech opening the session: 

"My Loyal and Gracious Lords, My friendly and harmonious relations with all the powers continue. Their declarations from every quarter are favorable to the maintenance of European peace. In connection with the approaching evacuation of Egypt by the British East African Company, I have deemed it expedient to authorize a commissioner of inquiry and ability to examine on the spot, with suitable provisions for his safety, all the best means of dealing with the country, and to report to the Government. In view of recent occurrences in Egypt, I have determined upon making a slight augmentation in the number of British troops stationed in that country. This measure does not indicate a change of policy or a modification of the assurances my Government has given from time to time respecting the British occupation of Egypt. The executive has declared in terms satisfactory to me. I shall henceforth follow the established practice of previous consultation with any government in political affairs, and I desire to act in cordial cooperation with it in relation to both Egypt and Canada. Papers in continuation of those heretofore presented will at once be laid before you, gentlemen. 

If the estimates of the charges necessary for the public service during the coming financial year have been framed, they will be laid before you at an early date. 

My Lords and Gentlemen: I have observed with concern the wide prevalence of agricultural distress in many parts of the country. It is to be hoped that among the causes of the present depression some are of a temporary nature, but without doubt you will take this grave matter into your consideration and make it a subject of careful inquiry. 

The proclamation which placed Ireland under exceptional provisions of law has been revoked, and I have satisfaction in informing you that the condition of that country with respect to crime continues to improve. A bill will be submitted to you, on the earliest available occasion, to annul the provisions for the government of Ireland. This bill has been prepared with the desire to afford contentment to the Irish people, to confer important relief upon Parliament, and to establish additional securities for the strength and union of the Empire. Bills will be promptly laid before you for the amendment of the system of registration in Great Britain, for shortening the duration of Parliament, and for establishing equality in the franchise by the limitation of each elector to a single vote. There will also be proposed to you various bills regarding the condition of labor, among which there will be measures in relation to the liability of employers, the hours of labor of railway servants, and a bill to amend the law of conspiracy. Your attention will likewise be invited to measures for the further improvement of local government, including bills for the creation of parish councils, for an enlargement of the powers of the London County Council for the prevention of the growth of new vested interests in ecclesiastical establishments in Scotland and Wales, and to establish direct local control of the liquor traffic, together with other measures of public utility. I humbly commend your labors on these and other subjects to the guidance of the Almighty. 

Mr. Balfour's Attaché: The early evening was passed in the House of Commons in giving notices of motion. Notice that Mr. Gladstone would introduce his Home Rule bill on next Monday elicited prolonged Liberal cheers. The mover and seconder spoke to empty benches. The House filled like magic, however, when Mr. Arthur J. Balfour, first lord of the Treasury in the last Salisbury Cabinet, and now leader of the Unionist Opposition, arose somewhat languidly and amid a storm of Opposition cheers began a general criticism of the Government. He congratulated the Cabinet upon the abandonment of the policy to abandon Uganda. In their Egyptian policy, Mr. Balfour said the ministers could rely upon the support of the Opposition as long as they upheld British rights. He trusted the Government would at their earliest convenience let Parliament know the cause which led to the recent troubles in Cairo. Among the causes, undoubtedly, were the rash utterances made by the Prime Minister and the Chief Secretary for Ireland when they were in the Opposition. Both were to blame for rising hopes which would certainly be productive of future difficulties. He demanded that the Home Secretary should say whether or not the release of Egan and Callan, the Irish dynamiters, was a part of a policy of amnesty intended to involve the release of all the Irish dynamiters, and he charged Mr. Morley, Irish Secretary, with having used the Crown prerogative for political purposes. 

Mr. Gladstone's Reply: Mr. Gladstone was cheered loudly when he rose to answer Mr. Balfour. He had noticed, he said, that with the continued growth of legislative arrears, the eagerness of the country for vigorous legislation increased. He had decided to lose no time, therefore, in satisfying this eagerness. He would secure the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the Westland question. He reproached Mr. Balfour for assailing with inflammatory criticism a bill not yet introduced, and for doing his utmost to prejudice the minds of his followers against a plan of home rule of which he was still ignorant. He would not reply to Mr. Balfour's invectives against Mr. Morley's administration of Ireland except to say that the wise policy of clemency had been simultaneous with a great decrease of agrarian crime. The mission to Uganda was necessary in order that an impartial and thorough inquiry be made into affairs there. The result of this inquiry would enable the Government to arrive at a rational decision. He did not believe that in his long Parliamentary career he had ever uttered words so rash and dangerous as were those uttered by Mr. Balfour concerning the difficulties in Egypt. These words seemed to suggest that the Government would lose no time in getting out of Egypt. Mr. Balfour rose and repudiated the charge that he had suggested the probability of a hasty evacuation. Upon resuming, Mr. Gladstone said that the Government had not to consider the question of occupation, but merely the maintenance of order. The relations of the two governments had now been placed on a satisfactory footing, and further trouble was not apprehended. 

In conclusion, Mr. Gladstone repeated his appeal to the House not to be moved by premature denunciations of the Home Rule bill. He could understand the impatience of members if they discovered any disposition to delay the bill, but this did not exist. It surely would be better for all to wait and give the provisions of the bill their full careful deliberation, perhaps calm, impartial, even benevolent judgment. 

After Mr. Gladstone's speech, the House adjourned. 

Lord Salisbury's Speech: In the House of Lords, several new peers, including Lord Playfair, took the oath prescribed for new peers. The Prince of Wales and his son, the Duke of York, had seats on the cross bench. They remained through part of the debate on the address in reply to the Queen's speech. Lord Brassey moved the adoption of the address. His motion was seconded by Lord Thring. Both mover and seconder spoke in general terms in support of the Government. Lord Salisbury, who today appeared in Opposition, after passing a compliment on Lord Thring, said he declined in the meantime to question the foreign policy of the Government. So far as known, in the absence of official papers, the policy of the new ministry seemed to be founded on sound principles and to be executed with judgment and skill. Events in Egypt rendered the difficulties surrounding the British occupation more numerous. The Government must postpone the withdrawal of British troops, but this in no wise modified the assurances that had been given to foreign powers concerning Egypt. Touching upon the question of home rule for Ireland, Lord Salisbury said that the one object of the Government during the past six months had been to get the support of a class of men whom hitherto no politicians in England had tried to conciliate. The keynote of the Irish policy of the Government was to get the support of the criminal classes. The provisions necessary to maintain the law had been repealed. Though agrarian crime was not prevalent generally, yet in districts where it did prevail, the hands of the law were paralyzed. (Conservative cheers.) The prerogative of the Crown had been used to shield murderers and release dynamiters. All the acts of the Government caused the impression that they were much more in sympathy with criminals than desirous of vindicating the law. (Cries of "Hear, hear.") The reference in the Queen's speech to home rule was the most peculiar sentence he had ever seen in a public document. It seemed to indicate that the Government's opinion of the whole Irish question with which Parliament had to deal was that it was for one portion of the Irish to place their heel upon the neck of the Protestant population of Ireland. 

With regard to the other measures indicated in the Queen's speech, Lord Salisbury declared that nobody believed that they would ever be undertaken. They were simply a repetition of the programme adopted by the Liberal conference at Newcastle. Lord Salisbury alluded to the agricultural depressions. He said that agriculture suffered most from want of confidence. Political partisans now preached doctrines that were filling the minds of the owners of capital with apprehension. There was no country in the world, Lord Salisbury added, where property was now so insecure as in Great Britain in consequence of erroneous legislative action. (Cries of "Hear, hear.") 

The Earl of Kimberley, Lord President of the Council and Secretary of State for India, replied to Lord Salisbury. He mildly remonstrated with Lord Salisbury for accusing the Government of having sympathy with Irish criminals. 

Mr. Gladstone Irritated: In his speech this evening, Mr. Gladstone showed plainly that he had been irritated by Mr. Balfour's taunts. The tones of his voice indicated deep indignation, and his gestures were rapid and violent, especially when he repudiated the imputation that royal clemency had been exploited for political purposes in the cases of the Irish dynamiters and the Gweedore prisoners. When he came to the discussion of Uganda and Egypt, his energy was partially exhausted, his voice was husky, and he was obliged to relapse into a conversational tone. He spoke for forty-eight minutes with good effect. The curious distribution of seats resulted in some confusion, especially during the last three or four speeches, which were interrupted repeatedly with cheers, laughter, and expressions of dissent from unexpected quarters. Nearly 400 notices of bills and motions were given during the sitting. This is the largest number recorded at any one sitting of Parliament. 

Lord Randolph Churchill, in conversation with friends this evening, disclaimed any intention of playing a conspicuous part in the present Parliament. A meeting of Parnellites decided this evening that John Redmond should move an amendment to the address in favor of a general amnesty for Irish political prisoners. Mr. Goschen, ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer, was elected to the Carlton Club tonight. The Unionists have resolved to abstain from pairing during the session. 

A WESTERN BLIZZARD Which Has Some Features Peculiar. St. Paul, January 31. A heavy blizzard is now raging. Here is the corrected text:

Throughout the Northwest, its violence is still unaltered. Wires are prostrated and trains delayed. The cold wave has acted strangely, as at eight o'clock this morning it was 38 below at Helena, and at Missoula, 100 miles north of there, it was 10 above at the same time. At Helena, there was a high wind from the west and another at Missoula from the east. In Duluth, it was 0 below, Winnipeg 10, and Jamestown 0, while at Fergus Falls, Grand Forks, and Fargo it was fully 20 degrees warmer, with high winds from a different point in each of these places. The mercury is now falling in most places. 

A Herman Prince, Berlin, January 31: Duke Victor of Battenberg, Prince of Corvey, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, and president of the Prussian Upper House, died at Breslau last evening. It is not what its proprietors say but what Hood's Sarsaparilla does that tells the story of its merit. 

Hood's Sarsaparilla.

FRANCE'S NATIONAL CREDIT was being weakened by assaults on savings banks. A SCENE IN THE CHAMBER when the Government brought down a bill to punish those who attack the bank. Paris, January 31.

1893-02-03: W. H. Agar, president of the Royal Electric Light Company, and Mr. Hudger, city electrician, with a staff of eight linemen, cut out 500 incandescent lights, but by forming loops on the arc lights, the latter were maintained and sufficient light was afforded to enable the firemen to perform their duty. The storm increased to a regular blizzard, which added to the difficulties under which the firemen were laboring. The hydrants are frozen, and the streams are only put in by the steamers. The clouds of steam and smoke rendered it impossible for the firemen to work. The firemen were knee-deep in slush and water. 

The flagstaff which adorned the pinnacle of the Holland building was the subject of innumerable wagers as to how long it would stand, whether it would fall inward or outward, etc. It made a hard fight of it, and finally wound up with a flourish by falling gracefully right into the heart of the fiery debris underneath. There was a constant stream of unfortunates from the houses adjacent to the burning buildings. They were loaded up with all kinds of household goods. The most novel incident in this connection was two persons of the colored persuasion who staggered along with a heavy Saratoga trunk crowned with a canary bird, and with a small pickaninny perched on top. A pitiful feature of the fire was the fact that the buildings were all surrounded by dwellings of the poorer classes of the community. On St. David's line and the yards abutting from it, whole families were seated out in the cold, and by this time a drifting snowstorm had set in serenely shortly after one o'clock to make matters more unpleasant if it were feasible for the unfortunates who had been driven out from their comfortable beds. 

"This is too bad," said a gentleman evidently of the insurance persuasion. "Too bad is it," was the reply from a hod carrier alongside. "Not by a blank sight! It will be good for the bricklayers." "What's the matter with the water pressure?" was the question on every side. "Why, it does not reach to the second story of Hardman's building." In fact, this seemed to be the principal difficulty with the hard-working firemen. At about two o'clock, the fire in the rear of the Ogilvie building looked threatening. The fire was only prevented from spreading to the stores of Porter, Teskey & Co. by the fire wall. From the Shand & Mason engine on Inspector Street, two streams were thrown into the burning building, but despite the desperate efforts, the fire looked as if it would spread. 

At three o'clock, a telephone message announced that the fire had spread to Porter, Teskey & Co.'s store along the roof. It looked as if the fire would burn clear through to Inspector Street. The Notre Dame hospital ambulance was early on the scene, and soon after its arrival, the attendants were called to care for a Frenchman who was suffering from inflammation of the bowels. The man had been sleeping in the house adjoining the Hood, Mann & Co.'s building, and when the fire caught at the latter place, some of the water played on the flames fell through the roof of the Frenchman's dwelling and drenched him in his bed. Between the scare and the chill resulting from the soaking, the poor man was almost a corpse when taken out of the house. He was removed to the hospital. 

Fires in Other Towns: Ainsworth, Ont., February 2: At 5 o'clock this morning, a fire broke out in the rear of Bertrand's confectionery, destroying Galvin's block from Menzies' drug store, which is gutted, down to the Arcade building on John Street. The loss on the block is $18,000; insured for $1,000 in the North British and Mercantile and Northern and Imperial. The stock of Mr. Menzies was insured in the Queen's for $1,000. His loss is $800.

1893-02-04: I, February 3: The new Washington express via the Reading and the New England railroad, eastbound, ran into the rear of the Norwich boat express in front of the station at East Douglass, Mass., on the New England road at 6 o'clock this morning. The shock was a terrible one and nearly all the passengers were more or less injured by being violently thrown from their seats. Engine No. 2, drawing the New York express, telescoped the rear car of the train, the locomotive entering the car about eight feet and smashing seats and floors into kindling wood. The smokestack was smashed and steam entered the car. In this car, there were 10 or 15 persons, but none were badly injured. When the impact came, the force drove the rear car into the combination car next forward, crushing in the forward end of the former and the rear of the latter for a distance of 10 feet, causing a mass of wreckage. In the combination car were a number of Italians. The shock threw them in all directions, and four of them were injured. Two doctors set the limbs of the injured, and they were removed to the hospital in Boston. The passengers in the rear car of the boat train escaped through the rear windows. 

Bomb, N.Y., February 1: Between five and six o'clock, a freight train left this city for the north on the Rome, Watertown, and Ogdensburg railway, followed by a snow plow. At McConnellsville, the train became stalled in the snow. A flagman was sent back to warn the snow plow. Before he had proceeded far, his lantern went out. He placed a torpedo on the track and undertook to relight his lantern, but before he could do so, the snow plow, running at a high rate of speed, dashed by and crushed into the freight train. The force of the collision was so great that it threw several cars on top of the snow plow. George Aiken and Thomas Kearney, who were inside, were instantly killed, and Conductor Wright of Richmond was so badly hurt that he may die. 

Denver, Colo., February 3: A wreck occurred last night on the Denver & Rio Grande railroad near Toltec, Southern Colorado, caused by a snow slide striking the train. Three cars were thrown from the track and eight persons injured. 

FROM THE ANCIENT CAPITAL: Visited by a Howling Blizzard: Court of Appeals Judgments, From our own correspondent: Quebec, February: The city was visited today by a howling blizzard. The streets were rapidly blocked with snow, and it was all but impossible in exposed places to proceed in the teeth of the wind, such was its force. To make matters worse, the temperature fell to 12 degrees below zero, and a number of people were more or less frozen. One man had his nose badly frozen in a St. John streetcar. One of the pages of the House had a narrow escape from being frozen to death. He was sent on a message outside the House, and on turning a corner, he was caught up by a gust of wind and thrown into a snowdrift. He found it impossible to extricate himself, and there he lay until some persons passing noticed him and got him out. He was carried inside the building, where it was found that his hands and face were slightly frozen. 

A recount of the votes cast at the late election in L'Islet will take place on the 14th instant before Judge Pelletier at St. Jean Port Joli. A letter from Malbaie, county of Charlevoix, brings news of a fatal accident that occurred to Leon Tremblay, who fell from a load of hay, dislocating his neck. The deceased was 40 years of age and the father of a family. Louis Mathieu, brother of the Rev. Dr. Mathieu, superior of the Quebec Seminary, died suddenly yesterday afternoon of apoplexy. 

This morning in the Court of Appeals, presided over by Hon. Judges Lacoste, Wurtele, Baby, Bosse, Blanchet, and Hall, judgment was rendered in the case of Dominick Fortier vs. the Quebec Central Railway, confirming the judgment of the Superior Court and awarding $5,000 to Fortier for injuries he received a year ago in the case of the Bell Asbestos Company vs. Johnston. Judgment was confirmed. The argument in the Boss will case was adjourned to hear some appeals from Arthabaska; it may be continued tomorrow.

1893-02-07: O. Libby, representing a syndicate of capitalists in the state of Maine, arrived here today, his object being to spy out land for the proposed colony of Maine farmers. He says that two hundred well-to-do agriculturists are prepared to leave that state for Manitoba in the spring. Chris Ctsik's furniture store and H. Fruger's hardware store, at the town of McGregor, were totally destroyed by fire last night. Mr. Robert Parker, a well-known wheelwright, last night swallowed quicksilver in mistake for medicine and is so fearfully burned internally that there is small hope of his recovery. The fish hatchery now being completed at Selkirk will be as large as all the thirteen other Canadian hatcheries combined. It will have a capacity for one hundred and fifty million spawn. J. Patrick Warde, resident of Swift Current, was frozen to death on Saturday while attempting to walk to a house eight miles across the prairie during the blizzard. He was only a mile from his destination when he sank exhausted. He leaves an invalid wife either in Toronto or Montreal. Winnipeg is overrun with crooks and sneak thieves. Eighteen or twenty of them committed to jail last fall have just been released.

THE RAVAGES IN THE SOUTH: It looks as if the rash and atrociously barbarous revenge of the Texans on the negro wretch, Henry Smith, were not to pass without its nemesis. It is not the first time that negroes have combined with vindictive determination to avenge, if not redress, the wrongs of their race at the hands of the whites. Not only have the West Indies, Haiti, Jamaica, Barbados, etc., been laid waste from time to time by a war of retaliation, or the whites have only escaped extermination by anticipating the doings of the blacks, but every region of the United States has also had its day of terror from this same cause. Twice even New York, in its sturdy infancy, when wealthy patrons and merchants were served by the sons of Ham, shuddered at the imminent prospect of a slave rising with murder, outrage, and indiscriminate massacre in its train. New England too had its uprisings, and from Virginia to Florida, the negro has at some time or another dealt out justice (as he deemed it) to the owners of his body. Since the war and emancipation, the fear of slave insurrection no longer robs Southerners of their sleep, but here and there, in the ruder portions of the Southern States, the bitter prejudice against the blacks reveals itself in ways that make resentment unavoidable and provoke all the ferocity of the still lurking savage. It generally happens that the blacks are in character and conduct very much like the white communities in which they live. What they are likely to be in the part of Texas where Smith met his awful doom, we may imagine. The state of affairs in Madrid shows that though Spain has a so-called Liberal Government, there is not enough... Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

Liberality in the population of the capital to permit a few Protestants to worship in peace as their conscience dictates. It is now twelve years since Señor Bagasla, with the consent of the late King, proclaimed freedom of religious opinion and worship for Spain. But when it came to putting the King's will and that of his minister into legal shape, it was found that the only concessions which could be wrested from hoary and obstinate bigotry were excessively slender. A few advanced democrats have to air their views about liberty, equality, and fraternity. There are even Socialists of the revolutionary allegiance in the ranks of Spanish agitators. But the rights of a little handful of simple Protestants have, it seems, no champion. It is a deplorable situation, almost incredible that it should exist within the pale of Christendom and civilization were it not only too well established. The Globe, discussing the situation at Toronto, says: "There is much vacant land in the suburb of Toronto that will not be saleable for years. A factory located upon it would cause an embryo village to spring up, and make a demand for small building lots. It might be well for the Industrial Association to canvass among owners of suburban property for those who would be willing to give free factory sites. Such gifts would not be entirely unselfish, as they would secure the sale of adjacent property that would otherwise be a burden for years." The protective tariff which Conservatives support, but which the Globe rails at, is the carrying out in national affairs of the policy the Globe commends in local affairs to the Industrial Association. The Globe invites the proprietors of Toronto to give something to private individuals that they and the public may gain more, and the whole be benefited. The National policy does the same thing. Would the Globe indicate the particular point where such aid to industries ceases to be a virtue and becomes an offense? President Harrison has surprised both friends and opponents by appointing Judge Howell S. Jackson, of Tennessee, a Democrat, to the seat on the Supreme Court bench, vacant by Judge Lamar's death. The Boston Herald remembers no case in fifty years to parallel this move. In Canada, we can show better than that. Not a few of the present Superior Court judges throughout the country have been appointed by a government of a different side in politics. Neither the government nor the public have had cause to regret such action, and neither, it is safe to say, will Mr. Harrison, even though he has broken a fifty years' precedent. The grant to the Trappists by the Quebec Legislature of 60,000 acres of land in the Lake St. John district is being quoted in some Western papers as evidence of the rule of the Monk in Quebec politics. Usually, public grants to religious corporations are not commendable. In this case, however, the Monks in question are going into the forest to show how it can be reclaimed. If they re-imbue the habitant with the old pioneering spirit, and help to make glad the waste places of the north country, their work will pay for their land, even if another 60 is added to the total of the acres. Between the cranky and cheeky Saxon who insisted on calling his innocent baby Robespierre Danton and the arbitrary registrar who, having declined to accept such a name, fined the obstinate father for neglect to register, because he must have his choice or nothing, who shall decide? Mulcted, the admirer of Robespierre appealed to a higher court, only to have his case dismissed, on the ground that in a country both Christian and monarchical no one has a right to name his child after avowedly atheistic and republican scoundrels—a judgment at which Carlyle would have smiled. Mr. John Dillon's advice that the agitation for amnesty for Irish convicts should cease is timely in two senses. First, calling for the release of the prisoners detracts public attention from the support of the rule, whose prospects are not bright. Secondly, it is not a very wise agitation in itself. It requires a specially constituted stomach to hold the claim that blowing up houses and mobbing men to death are political offenses. Within the past two months, fifteen animals, taken from twelve steamers sailing from the ports of Baltimore, Boston, and New York, have been condemned by the English authorities for being infected with pleuro-pneumonia. It must have been a strain on Mr. Rusk's vision not to see this recently made heap of his own pet stock when he was searching for the molehill of Canada's alleged cases buried three months ago. A recent issue of the Congressional Globe contains thirteen columns of titles of petitions for the opening of the World's Fair on Sundays. Getting up petitions to Parliament and Congress has heretofore been rather the forte of the good people. It looks as if in this instance the evil one had beaten them at their own game. The New Zealand Government has protested against the threatened annexation of Hawaii by the United States. New Zealand is a true pup of the John Bull breed. It recognizes only one power as having any legitimate business in the way of annexing other people's territory. A telegram from St. Paul says the Dakotas are experiencing the worst blizzard of the season. As this has been a peculiarly bad season, the inhabitants of the blizzard land would seem to be entitled to special sympathy.

Hamilton, Ont., February 20: One of the most severe blizzards experienced here in years raged yesterday and last night. The thermometer fell to eight below zero, and in the mountains, it ranged much lower. Railroad travel in this vicinity has not been interrupted, and trains are running as usual today. At a meeting of the quarterly board of Centenary Church held on Saturday, it was decided to extend a call to the Rev. K. Lanceley, who has been called to Baltimore. A special cable to the Evening Telegram from London says the Hon. Charles Tupper, Canadian Minister of Marine and Fisheries, left for Paris today to attend the first meeting of the Retiring Sea Commission as one of the representatives of Canada. A regular Manitoba blizzard prevailed throughout the province of Ontario on Saturday night and Sunday and today. All railroad lines and highways are badly blocked with snow. Trains that have got through are from two to twelve hours late, and many have had to be canceled. Country travel is almost suspended, and streetcar lines have had a hard time. Business in many places is almost entirely suspended. The weather was bitterly cold.

Knights of the Round Table Rejoice Again: The recent spell of soft weather was not a soft snap for the curlers; in fact, it was a very disappointing one, for it looked as if several matches would have to be left unfinished till next season. But the blizzard of yesterday brought joy to the heart of the curler, and last night the ice at all rinks was in splendid condition, and some scratch matches were in progress. St. Lawrence Curling Club: Owing to the mild turn in the weather during the past ten days, the rink competitions have been somewhat retarded, and until today, when Old Sol decided to favor us with cooler weather, it was feared that the completion of the following competitions would have to stand over until the season of 1893-94. The directorate, however, are now in hopes that members interested in these matches will better themselves and take advantage of the cold snap and complete all competitions during the present week. In the second drawing for the John J. McGill Cup, Hugh Ross's rink has still to play against Frank Founder's rink, and J. D. Anderson against W.

A destructive hurricane swept on the 10th of March over the New Hebrides islands and New Caledonia, clearing villages and causing great loss of life. Large numbers of the natives are said to have perished, and extensive districts were devastated. New Caledonia forms with neighboring islands the most important penal colony of France, and particulars are anxiously awaited as to the destruction of life and property at Noumea and other points. The New Hebrides have but few white inhabitants, but among those are missionaries from America and Europe. The hurricane raged incessantly for three days and the rainfall was enormous. Half of New Caledonia is flooded. In Tohio alone ten persons were drowned. The total property loss was at least $120,000. 

St. John's, March 20: A fearful blizzard visited this section yesterday. It was the worst experienced in twelve years. The streets were snowed under to the extent of three feet. In the country, the snow is ten feet deep in places. All railway lines are blocked. At Salmon, five men were drowned by the swamping of a herring skiff. It is feared that other disasters have occurred. 

THE ANN ARBOR STRIKE: Interviews with Grand Masters. 

Sargeant, of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, in an interview yesterday, said: "The action on the part of Judge Picks, of Toledo, looking to the arrest for contempt of court of all engineers who have led their engines on the Lake Shore road rather than handle Ann Arbor freight is news to me. I left Toledo Friday morning as soon as I saw there was no possible chance for a settlement, and came home Saturday. I got a telegram from Chief Arthur saying he and I had been jointly sued in Judge Taft's court for $250,000 damages by the Ann Arbor road for ordering the strike on their road. But there is no provision in the Brotherhood's rules that requires firemen on other roads to refuse to handle freight from a road on which there is a strike; so the present action of Judge Picks can hardly apply to us. The engineers have such a rule, however, and this rule will now be put to the test as to whether or not it is legal. I realize that both the actions in Judge Taft's and Judge Picks' courts are very important ones, and on their verdict depends much of interest to the future of railroad organizations. Yesterday I received a telegram that three Brotherhood firemen had been discharged from the Lake Shore for refusing to handle Ann Arbor freight. I shall expect the engineers to see that these men get back their places, as they got into trouble through the engineers living up to their boycott rule, which drew the firemen into it. Chief Arthur is merely enforcing the laws of his order as he finds them, which he is obliged to do. Whether we can be sued for damages for ordering a strike on a railroad as the head of the firemen's organization is one of the questions involved, and as soon as I am summoned I shall appear to answer. The question is one of the gravest that ever confronted our organization."

Cleveland, Ohio, March 20: Chief Engineer Arthur, of the Brotherhood of Engineers, was here yesterday but refused to discuss the Ann Arbor strike further than to say: "We are law-abiding citizens and are going to obey the order of the court." Mr. Arthur would give no hint as to the future course of the Brotherhood.

SOME OF THE PLUMS: The President Nominates a Number of Ministers to Foreign Countries. Washington, March 20: The President today sent the following nominations to the Senate: James E. Eustis, of Louisiana, to be envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States to France; Theodore Runyon, of New Jersey, to be envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States to Germany; John K. Risley, of New York, to be envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States to Denmark; Walter U. Jabney, of Virginia, to be solicitor of the Department of State. The Senate has confirmed the following nominations: Josiah Quincy, Massachusetts, assistant secretary of state; Isaac P. Gray, Indiana, minister to Mexico; James E. Eustis, Louisiana, minister to France; Patrick A. Collins, Massachusetts, consul-general at London; Robert A. Maxwell, New York, fourth assistant postmaster general; Wade Hampton, South Carolina, commissioner of railroads; William McAdoo, New Jersey, assistant secretary of the navy; also a number of postmasters and army and navy nominations.

DIED IN THE SNOW: Nearly Three Hundred Prisoners Perish on the Journey to Siberia. London, March 20: Advices from St. Petersburg give the details of a sad loss of life among a band of convicts bound for the prisons of Siberia. The band numbered in all three hundred and seventy-four persons, including a large number of persons sentenced to exile for political crimes. In accordance with custom, the convicts were marching to their various destinations. They had spent the night in Tomsk, Western Siberia, and continued their journey early in the morning. A snowstorm was prevailing. Here is the corrected text:

And when six hours' march from Tomsk the storm had become so severe that all the roads were obliterated. Chained together, the convicts struggled on until gradually the weaker ones fell in the deep snow, dragging the stronger ones down with them. Despite the efforts of the Cossack guards, the exhausted people could make no attempt to save themselves, and they were abandoned to freeze to death while the others were driven forward, those in charge of them hoping to get them into shelter. The storm continued to increase in violence and the traveling became worse and worse. Now and then, prisoners would drop by the wayside, where they would soon be covered by the rapidly falling and drifting snow. When the guards managed to get what few remained of their charges to a place of safety, they found that of the 374 persons they had started with, only 61 survived. Sixty-two of those who had perished were political prisoners. Among those lost were Madame Lazarov, six other women, and four children.

M. Carroll finds full sway for his character ability, as well as ample scope in which to display his excellent dancing attributes. Edwin H. Carroll, who plays the Irish policeman, has gained for himself an enviable reputation as a delineator of Hibernian roles. Richard F. Carroll, as Old Sponge, a tramp, excites the comedy vein of the audience. Among the many realistic scenic effects in "The Dago," may be mentioned the fire scene, the blizzard, the Dago's attic, and the Brooklyn Bridge. The Carrolls are well supported by a capable company, including John K. Newman, Minnie Bowe, Britton Stephens, Blanche Howard, Nellie Lawrence, and little Annie Robin.

The Native African Choir

The first appearances of the celebrated Native African Choir, which took place in the Academy of Music, Hall Tax, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of this week, have proved an unqualified success artistically as well as financially. At 4 o'clock on Monday evening, seats reserved had been sold for all the performances, and every evening the "standing room" sign has been hoisted. All up the line news has reached the city that the visitors from South Africa will be greeted with like receptions. The members of the choir complain terribly of the cold experienced in this country, and consequently, the greatest care has to be taken to prevent any of the company from suffering from the effects of our Canadian climate. The native piano, which has caused so much interest among the seekers of musical curiosities in Europe, is now on its way to Montreal, where, upon arrival, it is to be exhibited prior to the performances here on April 10th, 11th, and 12th.

MUSIC AND THE DRAMA

Academy of Music

"The Two Sisters," which comes to the Academy of Music for Easter week, is a domestic comedy of the "Old Homestead" type, being, in fact, the production of the same authors. The moral of the story is shot at the audience with the force of a catapult. It is one of the best plays of its class. "Jane," bright and breezy "Jane," with the endorsement of two seasons' genuine success, comes to the Queen's Theatre Easter week, commencing with Monday matinee. Nichols and Lestoco stand in the very front rank of American playwrights, but they have turned out nothing so fairly amusing as "Jane." Its engagement here will no doubt meet with the same success as in other cities. The comedy will be presented with Manager Fishman's brilliant company. The New York Herald's prize play, in one act, entitled "Chums," will precede "Jane" in a matinee raiser. 

The Carrolls, in "The Lhigo," will be the next attraction at the Theatre Royal. The play is a scenic-comedy-drama in four acts, from the pen of Richard F. Carroll, who for several seasons was a comedian of the New York Casino. Its story is founded upon the abduction of a child heiress by a wily and cruel Italian, and follows her life in the slums of New York, where her captor compelled her to beg and sing in the streets to provide him with money. After a lapse of two years, she is restored to her home by a heroic but humorous Irish policeman. The scenic features call for special mention as careful attention has been paid to this part of the production. The Brooklyn Bridge, the blizzard, a thrilling fire scene, and others are among the number. Tuneful medleys and catchy songs judiciously intersperse the action and dialogue of the play. The supporting company is one of merit. 

A Full Musical Entertainment

The members of Miss Barnjum's special classes will give a calisthenic entertainment in aid of the "Barnjum Memorial Gymnasium" on 17th April, in the Windsor Hall. Judging from the number of tickets already sold, there will be a bumper house. The box plan is open at Sheppard's music store, 174 St. Catherine Street. 

A Recital Concert

Madame Mourner, the celebrated contralto of the Grand Opera at Paris, who during the last week at Kohmur parts sang with much success different solos created by her at Paris and New Orleans, will give a partially sacred concert in this city before leaving for France. The programme will be one of the choicest ever heard in this city, and all lovers of classical music are invited to witness the concert of one of the greatest contraltos of the present age. 

Mme. Mounier will sing the "Ave Maria" by Gounod, as well as the "Church Grave of the Prophet." 

The following paragraph is trying to secure for our music lovers the opportunity of hearing in Montreal all the artists who come to New York who are the very "crème de la crème" from an artistic point of view. And for an Easter musical event, she has arranged with the New York managers for the appearance in Montreal of Russie Cottlow and Henri Marleau. These young artists have already achieved a high position, Marleau having gained his position in the first rank of violinists in all the great European centers of music, and his American successes have been second only to Paderewski. He is already compared to Sarasate and is only nineteen. Miss Cottlow's successes are, as yet, solely American; but they have been such as to gain for her a rank equal to many of the great artists of piano fame, and it is quite safe to predict that she will gain other laurels when she goes to Europe. Miss Cottlow is not yet fifteen. These two young artists will give a performance quite unique in its interest and which claims recognition from our public for the success already achieved.

SUNNY MANITOBA

It is always of importance to have honest estimates of what we prize, especially when the authors of them have some right to consider themselves experts in the matters as to which they pronounce judgment. Since the opening up of the Northwest, we have had a considerable variety of opinion touching the value of the prairie country as a home for immigrants. The latest of these expressions of opinion comes to us in the form of a volume for which the writer claims attention as the outcome of personal observation, unbiased by the interests of governments, companies, or individuals. He avoids indiscriminate eulogy on the one hand and unjust depreciation on the other, and his recommendation of "Sunny Manitoba" as a land of promise for a large class of his English compatriots has a note of sincerity which sometimes rises to the pitch of enthusiastic faith. 

Mr. Alfred O. Legge, the writer in question, has given hostages, so to speak, to the good fortune of the land that he praises, for his sons, to whom he dedicates his book, have for years been denizens of that land. For those who have read the statistical blue books of the Government and the many pamphlets of Prof. Tanner, Fream, Gilbert, and other experts, as well as the testimony of Prof. Macoun, Saunders, Bryce, and others who are intimately acquainted with the resources of the province, Mr. Legge's book will possess little novelty. One-half of it is mainly made up of gleanings from previous publications, and the remainder, while giving the writer's personal experience and opinions of the country, its products, and its people, goes over ground which has been largely covered by works already in print. The value of the book consists, however, in the fact that even when he avails himself of the data and conclusions of preceding writers, Mr. Legge adds information and reflections of his own which confirm what he deems justifiable and reject or refute what he considers unwarranted in the statements. His object is to correct certain mistaken impressions which spiteful or carelessly false accounts of the Northern prairie have made in the minds of many Englishmen. Some of those false accounts originated with emigration agents from the other side of the border, others from croakers among the settlers who, chiefly through lack of industry, judgment, patience, and other essential qualities, had failed to achieve a reasonable success, and others again from the willful misrepresentations of politicians eager to aim a telling blow at their opponents but unscrupulous in their choice of weapons. 

The best answer to the calumnies of all these interested detractors is to tell the true story of a typical settler, the owner of Riverside Farm, a homestead in which the author spent many a happy day. Of this farm, possession was taken in the fall of 1882, and we are initiated into the secrets of its development during the ten years that ensued. To the English farmer or citizen desirous of making himself an independent home in the new world, this record of progress must be of extreme practical interest. Mr. Legge describes the prairie, its natural means of irrigation, its flora, its fauna, its climate, the fertility of the soil, the risks of early frost and how they may be best guarded against, the mixed farming that is most likely to succeed, the society of the prairie land, the provisions for education, for religious ministration, for social intercourse and relaxation, and for intellectual culture. 

Among the unfounded notions that have come, in the minds of some old country people, to be associated with Manitoba and the Northwest, one is a belief that the blizzard has its Aeolian cave north of the boundary line. This Mr. Legge pronounces a popular delusion, which leaves those of his fellow-countrymen who read his book no excuse for continuing to cherish. Compared with Dakota and the other states to the south, Manitoba has the advantages both in climate and fertility, and those Canadians who hearkened to the interested wants of federal or state agents had sad reason to deplore their rashness. Apart from acknowledged diversities of climate, greatly in Canada's favor, statistics quoted by Mr. Legge show that the yield of wheat which in Dakota averages 9, in Minnesota 12, and in Wisconsin 12½ bushels to the acre, has in Manitoba an average of 24 bushels. From these figures, English farmers can draw their own conclusions. Other cereals, as well as most vegetables and many of the fruits of temperate latitudes, yield in like proportion. Of wild berries, there is an amazing growth, and the prairie is bright with wildflowers. Trees, once scarce in parts, are by judicious planting and experiments made with butternut, black walnut, soft maple, cottonwood, hard maple, white elm, white and green ash, and other trees, though the results varied in different localities, have on the whole been encouraging. Mr. Legge considers the birch, queen of ornamental trees, by no means difficult of propagation in the province, and wonders at its absence from the selection made by the Central Farm authorities. The high value of trees to the farmer is beyond question, and perseverance in experimental forestry is of the utmost importance to the future of Manitoba and the region beyond. 

Mr. Legge disagrees with those who condemn beet culture for sugar-making in the Prairie province and insists that it would be profitable to both growers and manufacturers. He devotes a good deal of attention to the industries, both actual and possible, of Sunny Manitoba. He points out its many and manifold attractions for the sportsman and lover of outdoor life and expresses his conviction that it is the healthiest country in the world. Social life, with acknowledged drawbacks, such as the proneness to intemperance among some of the young men and the ignorance... Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

In honor of others, has very real pleasure? Englishman-like, Mr. Lege prefers his compatriots to those who have had the honor to be born in Canada. He evidently was just long enough in the Northwest to lose his way in the labyrinth of our Dominion and provincial politics, and some of his judgments are curious. He is evidently a Liberal when he is at home, and, of course, he is a free trader, like the average Englishman everywhere. But he admires Canadian loyalty and its great spokesman and champion, the late Sir John Macdonald. Mr. Legge classes his book (which is published by Mr.

At 11 o'clock today the second heat of the novelty race was called. Fllard had won the first heat yesterday and he took the first today, giving him a cinch on first money. In the third heat, he took it easy and Strader came in first. He had been second in the first two heats, so this gave him second money and he and Fllard were sent to the stable. Sembia won the fourth heat and was sent to the barn with third money. The fifth race and fourth money went to Marine Fisherman. The second heat of the free-for-all race was one of the best races ever seen here. At the first turn, Flying Jib led, with Mascott second and Wonder third. They went in that order to the quarter. On the back stretch, Mascot began to let himself out. At the half mile, Jib was but a length in advance, with Keoler's home coming like a cyclone. On the turn for home, the two got away from the bunch and came into the stretch with terrific speed. Jib drew up slowly but surely and 50 feet from the wire was but a quarter of a length behind. A few more strides and Jib went into the air and ran under the wire only a neck in advance of Mascott, who finished grandly. The time was 2:04, by quarters as follows: 1:00, 1:02¼, 1:30, 2:00.

18940105: EUROPE CHILLED. The Suffering Playing: Hide and Go-seek. With the Zero Mark. London, January 4. A blizzard prevails in England today. There is a heavy snowfall in the southern counties. A severe gale is blowing in the Channel. The weather in Austria and Hungary is bitterly cold. In Vienna last night, the mercury registered nineteen degrees below the freezing point. The suffering among the poor is terrible. The Danube is frozen over from Vienna to Belgrade, Servia. At Trieste, the cold is intensified by a hurricane blowing from the north. Traffic of all kinds is stopped and the streets are deserted. Despatches from the North Sea and Baltic ports state that a furious storm is raging. Vienna, January 4. Despatches received early in the evening from Trieste said that the blizzard there is the worst storm that the city has experienced for ten years. More than 50 accidents had been reported since noon. All traffic, both by sea and land, had been stopped early in the afternoon. The Italian vessel Teira had been rendered top heavy by the vast masses of ice in her rigging and on her decks. She capsized and her crew was saved only with the greatest difficulty. The steamer Grata was wrecked last night near Ancona on the Adriatic coast of Italy. The crew was saved. London, January 4. At midnight, the thermometer stood 19 degrees above zero, Fahrenheit. It is much colder in the country. The snow continues. Paris, January 4. The weather is becoming colder. The river Seine is covered with thick ice. The railway trams arriving in the city are hours behind time, the delay being caused by the water freezing in the feed pipes of the engines.

18940120: H. Brennan; delegates to Central Trades and Labor Council, J. Warren, E. Coursol, and J. Hatch. The Trains Were Delayed. While it was raining in the city on Thursday evening very severely, a regular blizzard of snow was blowing as near the city as Iberville. The railway tracks were filled up with hard drifts, which it was almost impossible to penetrate, and the trains for Boston were delayed about three hours. Even then they could not get out on the main track at Iberville, having to use a side track, as the main track was not cleared until the next morning. The Boston and New York trains for Montreal fared better and were only a little behind time. The following are the names of the stallholders in the burned St. Antoine market, with their estimated losses: Louis Larue, $300; E. Larue, $1,000; F. Bigonette, provisions, etc.

18940130: P. Pelletier and Mayor Fremont also made brief addresses and were heartily cheered. The Chateauguay fort was next declared open, and the whole party were photographed standing on the battlements. The sleighs were again called into requisition, and the party drove out St. John street, down Palais hill, and out to St. Joseph street, inaugurating all the arches and other structures as they reached them. The Illumination Seminary boys accompanied them as far as the arch on St. Joseph street, on which is set the ice statue of Jacques Cartier. This closed the formal proceedings of the day. In the evening, the whole city was illuminated. The scene on the Grande Allee, just outside St. Louis gate, was very grand. On one side was an ice fort and two detached towers brilliantly illuminated with arc lights, while on the other were the Parliament buildings with every window from the cellar to the top of the tower blazing with light. In St. Rochs, the people had given even more attention to illumination and decoration than in the Upper town, and green, blue, and red fire was seen burning at frequent intervals. The Basilica square was brilliantly lighted up and colored lamps showed to great advantage against the evergreen tower. An attempt was made at the illumination of the Levis heights, but it was not altogether as successful as it might have been, owing to the blizzard which was raging most of the evening. Stray Carnival Notes: Justice Foamier, of Ottawa, is at the St. Louis hotel. Sir John Montgomery Moore, commander of the forces in British North America, arrived at the Union Club today.

WELCOMED VICE-ROYALTY: Their Excellencies in Attendance at Quebec Carnival. YESTERDAY'S PROCEEDINGS. Little Marred by the Severe Storm. Snowshoers Give Lord Aberdeen a Most Hearty Welcome. From our own correspondent, Quebec, January 30. His Excellency the Governor-General and Lady Aberdeen arrived in town this morning and were royally received by the snowshoers, who had turned out in hundreds in spite of the blinding blizzard. The train by which they travelled presented a curious spectacle as it rolled into the Canadian Pacific Railway depot. It was drawn by two powerful engines with a snowplow in front, and both engines and plow were covered with snow so that hardly any part of them was to be seen. They looked like a moving mass of snow. The viceregal party were received by the Hon. Mr. Joly, president of the Carnival; Mr. Van Felson, chairman of the Snowshoe committee; Mayor Fremont and other prominent citizens. The Mayor presented His Excellency with the key of the ice fort and welcomed him to the city, while Mr. Dunbar's little boy stepped forward and presented Lady Aberdeen with a handsome bouquet. A four-in-hand from Mr. Campbell's stables was in waiting outside the depot, and in this Lord and Lady Aberdeen took their places, with Lady Isabella Gordon and Mayor Fremont on the front seat. Meanwhile, the snowshoers had unhitched the horses and attached two long drag ropes. As many as could find room on the ropes took hold and a number of others crowded the pole, foremost among the latter being the Hon. Mr. Joly, who entered into the spirit of the thing as heartily as the younger boys. The rest of the snowshoers formed up around the sleigh as a bodyguard, and the bugle and drum bands of the Quebec and Emerald Snowshoe clubs took up positions at the head of the procession. The word being given, the bands struck up and the procession moved off. On passing under the Palais arch, the snowshoers who manned it cheered lustily. Now they came to the steep hill, up which, covered as it was with snowdrifts, the boys were to drag the sleigh. It looked a hard task, but it was easily accomplished. The boys dragged the sleigh through the drifts or over them, and...

brought the distinguished visitors briefly up to the Château Frontenac. Their Excellencies did not seem to mind the storm a bit, and Lord Aberdeen remarked that they sometimes had weather like this in Scotland. This remark was made while the procession was passing the most exposed part of the whole route. The scene as the procession was entering the arch of the gateway leading to the courtyard of the hotel was most picturesque. Every window of the hotel was crowded with guests, mostly Americans, anxious to get a view of the vice-regal party. As the sleigh drew up at the door, Lord Aberdeen got up on the seat and made a brief address in French and English. He expressed himself as charmed with his reception. It was a novel experience to him, this snowshoers' reception, and he would never forget it. The boys gave three cheers for Lord Aberdeen, three for Lady Aberdeen, and three more for Mr.

1894-02-12: The New York Commercial Advertiser says of today’s stock market: After a week of more or less excitement and wide changes in the industrials, it was quite natural that this group of stocks, or at least a portion of them, should occupy a prominent position in the trading. The varying phases of the situation at Washington afford an opportunity for quick turns in these specialties by professional operators who still continue to hold the reins governing price fluctuations. Consequently, they are for the moment the popular favorites. Two of their number, Sugar and Whiskey, find more of a following than the rest, simply because of the fact that they will be made to feel the effects of tariff legislation. The likelier hood that the Senate committee will recommend a duty of one cent a pound on both raw and refined does not meet with universal approval by the friends of Sugar, as yesterday's late heavy selling of the stock would indicate, but the managers of the concern profess to believe that eventually their interests will receive ample consideration, and the confidence displayed in this quarter more than offsets the disappointed feeling in other directions, particularly as insiders rally to the support of the stock on any and all occasions. Whiskey, however, does not show in the generally better sentiment that surrounds Sugar, and the stock today, as on yesterday, acted as a laggard. The undoubted evidence that insiders were sellers on the bulge early in the week, at a time when the brightest kind of statements in relation to the property were in active circulation, has created a very unfavorable impression and accounts in a considerable degree for the heaviness of the stock. The next decided move will, in all probability, be in an upward direction, as the insiders are now talking in a bearish strain, presumably for the purpose of acquiring stock at a lower level. The favorable decision in the suit of the General Electric Company against the New York City Tax Commissioners, in which the Court of Appeals held that the company was properly taxed, was made the basis of quite an active buying movement of General Electric, and the stock developed strength. Chicago Gas was somewhat erratic, but in the main strong, while the balance of the industrials were dull and without material change. Previous estimates of the showing to be made by the St. Paul earnings for the first week of February proved erroneous, as instead of a considerable decrease, the falling off was only a little over $3,000. There was little or no chance, however, for the bulls to enthuse over this exhibit, as the figures compared with a blizzard week last year, consequently they could not be accepted as an indication of an improvement in the company's business. Early in the day, the Grangers were firm, but in the final dealings sagged off, a further drop in the price of wheat encouraging the bears to renewed action. The movements in the balance of the railway list may be dismissed as being too unimportant to call for special mention. At the outset, prices ruled firm, but the close developed a little easier tone, which was largely in sympathy with a decline in the industrials to about last night's figures. The bank statement showed some remarkable changes, the decrease in surplus reserve having amounted to $25,898,300, which brings it down to $85,038,700 from $111,623,000 last week, and compares with a surplus of $17,240,575 a year ago. The decrease in the actual money reserve amounted to $19,177,300, of which $6,622,200 was in special and $8,638,100 in legal tenders. Deposits were reduced $6,832,000, making a reduction of $4,408,000 in the required reserve. The increase of $13,034,500 in loans conforms to the changes in the other items. The changes shown today were about what were looked for in view of the large payments for the new bonds made by the banks to the sub-Treasury; but the statement does not reflect the full extent of such payments, and next week's Clearing House report will show a further large decrease in surplus reserve. Macdonald Bros., stock brokers, 69 St. Francois Xavier Street, report the closing prices on the Montreal Stock Exchange today as follows: 

Canadian Pacific $100.25, 54 70 70.

A Kansas Blizzard 

Kansas City, Mo., February 11. One of the fiercest snowstorms ever known in this section began at noon today and is still raging. The local signal service officers say it will continue throughout the night. Traffic on all streetcar lines was blocked by six o'clock this afternoon, but tonight some of the lines have partly cleared their tracks. Evening trains from all directions centering in this city were from one to four hours late, a condition that is rapidly growing worse. Reports from many points in the West indicate a very general storm. 

Mmlila's Commercial Treaties

TWO GREAT SHOW STORMS 

One Extends Over America and the Other Over Europe 

TRAFFIC IS PARALYZED 

In Western Canadian Cities, and at Many Points in the United States. Disasters in England. 

Yesterday appears to have been most remarkable as far as storms are concerned. Sunday evening's dispatches brought the news that a very severe blizzard was prevailing in Kansas. This storm has since spread all over the Western states, going as far south as St. Louis, where the phenomenal fall for that latitude of four inches of snow was recorded. Chicago's winds never blew before as they did yesterday, and from all points in the Western states come the same reports of unprecedented snowfalls and heavy winds. In Canada, the storm, or another, appeared at an early hour yesterday morning, and by six o'clock, the electric car services in all the important points west of Toronto had been completely paralyzed. This continent was not alone. The cable reports extraordinarily high winds as prevailing in Great Britain, attended by many shipwrecks, while reports of the same nature come from Europe, as far distant as Austria, showing that the European storm was almost as widespread as the American.

IN CANADA, 

Yesterday's Storm Paralyzed all the Western Ontario Towns 

Toronto, February 12. The snowstorm here was one of the worst recollected by the average citizen. The streetcar service was badly blocked early in the afternoon, and electricity gave way to horse power in the outlying lines. Unchanged street electric cars were kept running with difficulty all day. Drifts were formed in many streets to the depth of several feet. Trains coming into the city were very late. Meetings announced for the evening were in every case very thinly attended, and the streets were empty tonight. No damage in the city is reported from the storm at present. 

St. Catharines 

St. Catharines, February 12. A terrific wind and snowstorm has prevailed here most of the day and is still raging. The electric street railway car line is knocked out and traffic generally demoralized. 

London 

London, Ont., February 12. The storm today was the severest that has visited this city this winter and was made up of wind, sleet, and snow; it completely paralyzed business. The wind reached its greatest velocity about noon and prevailed with undiminished strength for the remainder of the day. Comparatively little snow fell, but what there was was blown into drifts about the sidewalks and pavements. On the eastbound railroads, trains were running a little behind time owing to the storm. 

Niagara Falls 

Niagara Falls, Ont., February 12. The worst snowstorm of years struck town this morning. A regular northeast gale blew the snow in all directions. Towards evening, the gale reached a terrific force, piling the snow up in piles eight to ten feet deep, completely suspending traffic on the streets. The horse cars to Drummondville shut down for the night early in the afternoon. The electric lines on both sides of the river, after fighting the storm, gave up in despair. The railways are having their hands full trying to keep their lines open for passenger traffic only. Passenger trains on all the lines are running from three to five hours late, freight traffic being abandoned. 

Hamilton 

Hamilton, February 12. A genuine blizzard struck here today. A snowstorm, accompanied by a very strong northeast wind, has been raging nearly all day. The electric service is entirely suspended and street traffic generally is much impeded. Trains east and west are pretty well on time, and from the north and south, the service has been kept up fairly well so far. 

Windsor 

Windsor, Ont., February 12. The Windsor, Sandwich, and Walkerville street railway lines were tied up by the storm about 10:30 this morning, and the cars stand in the street where they were deserted by their crews. Traffic and business of all kinds is almost entirely suspended. The ferry boats are almost deserted, and it is almost impossible to make a landing on the other side. The water in the Detroit River is rapidly backing from the lakes below and has risen nearly three feet since yesterday, the current being at a perfect standstill. It is almost an impossibility to run the car ferries, and trains on all roads entering Windsor are several hours behind time.

THE AMERICAN END 

It Began in Kansas and Ended In the Atlantic 

Chicago, February 12. The worst blizzard that ever struck this city, so far as the weather bureau records show for twenty-three years, is raging here. Street traffic is greatly impeded and walking is accompanied with great danger to life and limb. Many persons have already been injured by being blown to the ground, against walls and street posts by the wind. The velocity is eighty miles an hour, the highest ever recorded for this city and almost double the velocity of the wind which is blowing a blizzard in the Western states. The wind was so furious at the corners where skyscrapers are built, especially the Monadnock annex block, bounded by Jackson, Van Buren, and Dearborn streets and Custom House Place, that extra policemen gave all their attention to the pedestrians. Dozens of women were lifted off their feet and blown to the ground, or else pushed across the streets until they came in violent contact with walls, posts, and other obstacles. Mrs. Brahany, of No. 361 South Clinton Street, a charwoman at the Arstifince, was lifted in the air and dashed against the fireplug of the Dearborn and Van Buren street corner. Two of her ribs were broken, and it is believed she is internally injured. She lay in the snow drift until men rushed to her rescue, and the police ambulance took her home. The gusts of wind and blinding particles of snow frightened men as well as women from attempting to cross Dearborn Street at Van Buren. The effect on others kept them within sheltering doorways.

And policemen became a volunteer brigade, and on the principle that in union there is strength, they locked arms with the belated police workers and crossed in safety. At the stockyards, there was a practical suspension of business all morning. No buyers were to be seen. Stock trains were late, and when they did arrive, they were covered with snow. In the suburbs, the storm was felt with rather more severity than in the heart of the city. One of the big front windows of the Leland Hotel was blown in early this morning at the very beginning of the storm. The glass was blown clear across one of the parlors by the force of the wind, but the window was boarded up before any serious damage was done by the snow. The drifted snow and the high wind played havoc with the mail. Nearly all the mail trains were late, and from some of them, no tidings were received until late in the day. All the roads suffered, both the eastern and western trains being from one to eight hours late. The driving snow made signals on the railroad tracks practically useless and caused a collision between two freight trains on the West Shore tracks near 97th Street and Stoney Avenue about noon. Luther J. Webster, fireman on the second train, had his foot crushed. More accidents were reported to the police today resulting from the high wind. In spite of the fearful weather and the condition of the streets, the ambulances were kept busy a large part of the day. Bloomington, Ill., February 12: A violent snowstorm raged throughout central Illinois all day. The snow is ten inches on a level and is badly drifted. Many trains are delayed, and one passenger train on the Big Four is stuck in a drift near Tremont. There are drifts here five feet deep. 

Indiana, Fort Wayne, February 12: The great blizzard reached this city at four o'clock this morning and is still raging. All streetcar traffic was abandoned at an early hour. Every railroad centering here is blocked, and traffic is practically suspended on all lines. 

Wabash, February 12: The heaviest snowstorm of the season raged here yesterday and today. The wind blows sixty miles an hour. The thermometer was below zero, and the suffering among the poorly clad and half-housed people on the big prairie north of here is fearful. 

New York, Saranac Lake, February 12: The worst storm of the season is now raging here. The thermometer has dropped 42 degrees in four hours and now registers eight below zero. Snow is falling, and aided by a terrific west wind, is drifting badly. 

New York, February 12: The city tonight is covered with a mantle of snow several inches thick. Travel of all kinds is greatly impeded. The storm is the most severe one of the season and is expected to last until tomorrow night or Wednesday morning. The thermometer is down to 20 degrees, and the wind is blowing from the northeast at the rate of thirty miles an hour. Railroad traffic is almost demoralized. All trains are behind time, and the mails from the south and west are greatly delayed. The ferry houses are blocked with belated passengers waiting for the overdue ferry boats, which are compelled to run at a considerably reduced rate of speed. The elevated railroad trains are delayed. The effect of the snow is felt on the outskirts of the city, and the markets are stagnated by the lack of farm produce, the roads being almost impassable on account of deep snow drifts. Sergeant Dunn of the weather bureau said tonight that this storm was but the advance guard of one more severe, which would be followed by a very cold wave. Danger signals have been ordered up all along the coast, and vessels have been warned not to leave port. At the rate the snow is falling tonight, it will be a foot deep by morning. Reports from all points throughout the state indicate that the storm is general and very severe and that traffic is greatly impeded; trains are badly delayed everywhere. Despatches from New Jersey report a similar state of affairs. The storm along the New Jersey and Long Island coast is particularly severe. A high northeast gale prevails, and the air is thick with flying snow. Mariners off the coast will have a hard night of it. It is probable that several wrecks will be reported tomorrow. The lifesaving crews have doubled their patrols and are on the alert to promptly answer signals of distress. One wreck was reported tonight. It occurred on Rockaway Beach, opposite the Arverne Hotel. The Arverne lifesaving crew cannot go to the relief of the vessel on account of the blinding snowstorm and the high and heavy sea which prevails. The vessel is stranded some distance off shore, and her size or the crew she carries cannot be ascertained. The fate of the crew is in doubt, but their position is an extremely dangerous one. 

Nebraska, Omaha, Neb., February 12: Nebraska is snowbound. For the past twenty-four hours, a terrific blizzard has prevailed throughout the state. The fall has been about twelve inches, and following the eight-inch fall of snow on Thursday, makes the depth at least twenty inches. The cold is extremely severe with few exceptions. Omaha traffic of every description is suspended. Trains in every direction last night were abandoned. The mail trains are being got through with difficulty. The high wind has been piling the snow in great drifts. Reports from the interior show stock is in good condition, and farmers are pleased with the immense snowfalls, as it assures a fine winter wheat crop. 

Ohio, Cleveland, February 12: A severe wind and snowstorm from the northwest struck this city this morning. Nearly all trains are late. Streetcar traffic is almost entirely suspended. 

Fremont, O., February 12: In a blinding snowstorm, which had been raging all morning, freight train No. 40, westbound, and eastbound light freight No. 25, on the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad, collided two miles west of Bellevue about 10:30 o'clock. Both engines and several freight cars were smashed and piled up in confusion. Engineer Connell of light freight No. 25; Fireman McMullen of engine No. 25; Brakeman Johnson of freight engine No. 28; and Engineer Samuel Stowell of engine No. 28 were killed. 

Missouri, St. Louis, Mo., February 12: Without warning from the weather bureau, a veritable Kansas blizzard struck this city at 11 o'clock last night and continued up to 6 o'clock tonight. Rain, hail, sleet, and snow alternately swept over the city before a high wind. At daylight, the street railways had abandoned efforts to run cars till the tracks were cleared by snowplows. All the railway trains that were not abandoned entirely were late, the Alton express from Chicago being eight hours behind time. The snow is four inches deep, which is phenomenal for this latitude. As time passed, the storm increased in severity, and at 2 p.m., the wind had risen to a 30-mile gait, with the thermometer 8 degrees above zero and falling. The casualties are numerous, but none serious. The overhead wires look like masses of white ropes, and many have been snapped by the weight of ice. Two horses were shocked to death by coming in contact with a broken live wire. Telegrams from all points from the South and West show that the storm is widespread and disastrous. 

Mississippi, New Orleans, February 12: Advices received here today and tonight indicate that a storm approaching in violence a cyclone is raging in Mississippi, and that the town of Newton has been wiped out of existence, but as the telegraph wires are all down, full particulars cannot be obtained. 

Memphis, Tenn., February 12: A special from Jackson, Miss., says: "A terrible cyclone passed between Martinsville and Beauregard, 40 miles south of here, at a late hour at night within a few miles of a patch of the terrible cyclone of April 1884. The cyclone was about a mile wide, and everything in its path was leveled. A great many houses were swept from their foundations, trees twisted off, fences destroyed, several people killed, and a great many seriously injured." 

Kansas, Kansas City, February 12: The worst snowstorm in years raged all over Kansas and Missouri last night and today, for not a single train was on time. The snow averaged from one foot to two feet on the level. High winds accompanied it, and at some points it is 20 feet deep. In many sections, schools were closed today. In towns with street railways, the service was paralyzed. The snow was dry, and the telegraph service was not injured. 

Topeka, Kan., February 12: All railroads in Kansas are blockaded with snow, and scarcely a wheel is turning in the state. 

Vessels Ashore, Long Branch.

1894-02-14: M certainly has no equal. In 1880, he drove the Beaconsfield Government from power simply by arousing public feeling on a matter of very little concern to the British electorate—the so-called Bulgarian atrocities. Since then he has performed the miracle, for it is little less than that of gaining a majority in the United Kingdom in favor of home rule. If he undertakes a campaign against the Lords, he will have everything in his favor. The abolition of the Peers has long been an item in the Radical programme, and almost every member of the present administration, except Mr. Gladstone himself and those of his colleagues who are in the Upper House, has taken occasion to throw a stone at the Peers during the last few weeks. The Liberal press has been busily engaged in denouncing the Lords with all the vigor at its command. It only needs the fire of Mr. Gladstone's eloquence to set the whole party aflame against the Lords, and if there is not a great outburst of popular indignation, there will be an agitation dangerous enough to make the Lords hesitate before such an encounter. If the struggle which the Liberals are threatening goes on, what are the forces the Peers can bring to meet their assailants? The Marquis of Salisbury is an able administrator and a clever speaker, but as a leader of the Democracy, he is not worth a cent, and it is largely through his imprudence that this struggle has been provoked. His nephew, Mr. Balfour, is also a good speaker and more popular than his uncle, but he is not weight for Mr. Gladstone. The best man the Unionists have for the work is Mr. Chamberlain, and he was the first, and as yet the only, man to take up Sir William Harcourt's challenge. His defense of the Lords was that the Peers had correctly interpreted the feeling of the vast majority of the British electorate. This is undoubtedly the best card for the Unionists to play, but Mr. Chamberlain is hardly the man to play it. There was a time when Mr. Chamberlain was a Radical, and no one said bitterer things about hereditary legislators than he did. Ten years ago, when the Peers rejected the bill enfranchising the country laborers, Mr. Chamberlain spoke words which seem to the Radicals admirably suited to the present situation: "Are the Lords to dictate to us, the people of England? Are the Lords to dictate to us the laws which we shall make and the way in which we shall bring them in? Are you going to be governed by yourselves, or will you submit to an oligarchy which is the mere accident of birth? It is inconceivable that you should be so careless of your great heritage as to submit your liberties to this miserable minority of individuals who rent their claims upon privilege and upon accident. The history of the House of Lords has been one long contest between the representatives of privilege and the representatives of popular rights, and during this time the Lords have perverted, delayed, and denied justice until at last they gave grudgingly and churlishly what they could no longer withhold. I resent the insults, the injuries, and the injustice from which you have suffered so long at the hands of a privileged assembly. But the cup is nearly full. The career of high-handed wrong is coming to an end. We have been too long a peer-ridden nation, and I hope you will say to them that if they will not bow to the mandate of the people, they shall lose forever the authority they have so long abused. The man who spoke these words cannot pose as the champion of the Peers with any hope of success. Mr. Chamberlain may be justified in his contention that the Lords are right now, though they may never have been right before, but his own words condemn him. The issue will not be restricted to the conduct of the Lords in the present crisis. Their long course of opposition to popular reforms will be brought in evidence against them. What their record is, the words of Mr. Chamberlain quoted above sufficiently indicate. All the great reforms of the last fifty years have been opposed by the Lords, and though they have passed them under pressure from the electorate, they have not ceased to disapprove of them. The House is thoroughly out of sympathy with the democracy of today and acts merely as a drag upon the legislative coach. It has been tolerated because Englishmen are not given to sentimental grievances and will put up with anomalies so long as they cause no serious inconvenience. As an institution, the House of Lords cannot be logically defended in a modern democracy. It has been allowed to remain part of the British constitution because it gave little trouble and was willing to give way under the pressure of public opinion. It has saved itself this way before and, no doubt, will be able to escape by the back door in this instance. But these struggles are dangerous, and every one of them, to use a pet phrase of the Radicals, "drives another nail into the Lords."

'coffin "The less public attention is drawn to the House of Lords, the longer it is likely to be left alone. That is why it seems unwise on the part of Lord Salisbury to have involved the Peers in the present struggle. Circumstances justified them in rejecting the Home Rule bill, but to override the decision of the elected representatives of the people on matters so directly concerning the democracy as local self-government and employers' liability was to arrogate to themselves a position which cannot be defended. If Mr. Gladstone, by an appeal to the electorate, carries the Home Rule bill and other democratic measures, and at the same time deals a serious blow at the prestige of the House of Lords, the Peers will only have themselves to thank. A question was recently asked by a correspondent of the Times which gives a curious glimpse into some features of the English meat market. It was stated in that paper that 1,373,723 carcasses of frozen sheep had come last year from the River Plate alone, in addition to 2,514,541 from Australia and New Zealand. Mr. Beddington, a farmer, wants to know what becomes of this importation. He knows London well, but cannot recall a single firm having offered to sell River Plate mutton, although ostensibly many firms deal in the New Zealand article. After some computation, he reaches a conclusion which he deems not improbable: that the River Plate mutton is mainly sold as New Zealand, while the latter is sold as English mutton. He suggests compulsory branding of all foreign meat, though such a plan may lessen the butchers' profits and retard the rapid march to ruin of the English farmer. It appears that a fortnight ago New Zealand sent by the steamer Kuapehu 11,855 cases of butter and 1,203 cases of cheese to England, the largest dairy cargo yet from that province. India has been permeated of late with a far-reaching sentiment in favor of social reform. This sentiment has displayed itself in various practical movements, in one province the reduction of extravagant outlays on marriage ceremonies being the aim; in another the enfranchisement of the Hindoo widow, the abolition of the system of inheritance through sisters in a third, and in a fourth, an urgent call on fathers of families to educate their female children. Another movement strikes a blow at improvident early marriages, the very same evil about the prevalence of which in the States Dr. Cyrus Edson has been writing in the North American Review. One Montreal wholesale house reports that as a result of the enlargement of the dairy industry, there has been a marked improvement in the dry goods business in many sections of the province. In one group of four parishes, an average of $65,000 a piece was distributed through the creameries and cheese factories! Most of it came back to the city in payments for greater quantities of goods bought. Turning the farmer into a manufacturer is benefiting all classes. Mr. Clendinning, in a letter on the politico-commercial situation, recalls for Canadians' benefit Abe Lincoln's advice not to swap horses while crossing the stream. There is better advice than this, however. It is to keep out of the stream. The commercial and financial mess the United States has got into since it put a party of would-be free trade tariff reformers into power shows that the stream is a dangerous place. Right after Vaillant's death, another bomb-thrower has alarmed Paris and maimed a score of its citizens. Execution by force of law, with its accompanying notoriety, is evidently not the deterrent it should be. The dynamiters may go on till they drive a persecuted public back to original principles when it punished crime by rising on the spot and destroying the criminal. Quebec's happy climate is again asserting its superiority. In the South, the people are freezing to death; in the West, they are blizzard-stayed, and in England, they are having their chimney pots and church steeples blown about their ears. Quebec has moderate winter weather, frosty but kindly. Some are finding fault with the Dominion Government because last session few great legislative measures were passed into law. There will be more who will think the fact is to its credit. In a fairly well-governed country, the desire to tinker at the statutes is a good one to suppress. As a result of the recount in the mayoralty election, Mr. McShane has so far lost over a hundred votes. The legal gun he took up went off at the wrong end.

CLAIMED HIS VICTIMS. The Great Storm Causes Much Suffering in Oklahoma. TRAFFIC IS RECOVERING FROM ITS FURY. The Storm in New York State and in the Niagara Peninsula Very Severe. Kansas City, February 13. Reports received here today from Oklahoma and the Indian territory make it almost certain that at least 30 lives were lost during the great storm of Sunday. Many isolated homesteads where the families were poorly prepared for the winter cannot be heard from for days and possibly weeks, and there is reason to believe 30 will not represent the total number of dead. In Western and Southwestern Kansas, there was great suffering, and it is probable that in more than one sod house dead bodies will someday be found. O mimic, Ok, February 13. The worst of the great blizzards seems to be over here and business is again resumed! Four trains that have been snowbound near Red Rock, in the Cherokee strip, for thirty hours, came in early this morning. Besides two families reported frozen near Grots, an unknown man was found near the Ponca Indian agency frozen stiff. Near Stillwater, a man was frozen to death under his house, and south of Cleveland, in county Q, a family of three persons perished. Two Tonkawa Indians are reported to have been found dead in Alma; near Andarka, three Indian children, who were caught out in the storm, perished. There are rumors of many other fatalities, but so far they have not been confirmed. Scores of cattle and horses perished in the strip, and in the big pastures in the Osageland Kiowa reservations, the number of dead cattle will reach thousands. El Reno, O. T., February 13. The storm of Sunday was the most severe in twenty years. There is much suffering to man and beast everywhere in this section, but only a few fatalities are reported in the immediate vicinity. Three Indian school children lost their way in the heavily falling snow and perished Saturday night. In the sparsely settled and inland towns west of here, the suffering and fatalities are greater than in any previous winter in years. Overland mail routes are blockaded and all communication is cut off by lines to this city from the West. All railroad traffic is impeded. In New York State, New York, February 13. The snowstorm yesterday and today was characterized at the office of the local weather bureau as the severest of its kind that has visited this city since the memorable blizzard of 1888. Last year was exceptional for its many and heavy snowstorms, but no individual storm of 1888 equaled this one in severity. Exactly one foot of snow had fallen by 8 o'clock this morning, and there was a fall of two inches more by 11 o'clock. Plattsburgh, N. Y., February 13. A small-sized blizzard prevails here this morning. The New York and Montreal train was five hours behind schedule time. A daily stage line across Lake Champlain, between Plattsburgh and Burlington, Vt., commenced running this morning. On the Niagara Peninsula, Niagara Falls, Ont., February 13. The great blizzard that reached here yesterday continued throughout the night and only abated in its fury about 10 o'clock this morning. All the great trunk lines were paralyzed, it being the next thing to impossible to move trains of any description. After midnight, hordes of men were kept out all night shoveling. The Grand Trunk Railway and New York Central managed to move one passenger train of three cars each way this morning, with two powerful locomotives on each train. Passenger trains from all directions are running from four to ten hours late this afternoon, some of the morning trains being abandoned altogether. This evening, the service is being improved as the lines are being cleared. Most of the roads will be able to move freights tonight. By tomorrow, it is expected the passenger trains will again run on schedule time. The horse car lines to Drummondville have abandoned their rails and are struggling with sleighs through the many large drifts of snow on the streets all day. The electric roads on both sides of the river expect to have their regular service all right by morning. The high wind blowing from the north caused the Niagara to fall fifteen feet yesterday from the highest known watermark. The river, since the gale abated, is rising rapidly to normal height, and the ice bridge is still intact, and is expected now to remain for the balance of the season. The European Storm Blowing, February 13. Reports of loss of life and damage to property by yesterday's storm continue to be received from all parts of the country. At Radeher, a scaffolding, upon which a number of men were working, was blown down and four of the workmen were instantly killed and a number injured. At Penzlin, a house was blown down and all the inmates were buried in the ruins. The debris was soon cleared away, when it was found that seven children had either been crushed to death or suffocated. At Rintoln, the tall chimney of the Stove and Glass works was blown over and some of the bricks struck three persons, killing them instantly. At Sonderburg, a bridge collapsed and several persons were killed.

Free Trade for Themselves. During the past few days, many Montrealers have received cards from the Customs department of the Post office notifying them that there was a package at the Post office Custom house addressed to them, which they could have when the duty was paid. In most instances, the notification card created wonder, for most of those receiving them have not ordered anything dutiable from the United States. Then they go to the place designated, and on showing their card, which bears a number, the holder is told that it is for a World's Fair portfolio. This in most instances makes the cardholder indignant, especially when he finds out that the amount of duty he owes is one cent and a half, but as this is an uncollectable amount, two cents is charged. When the duty is paid, the trouble is not over, for to prevent fraud, the same precautions have to be taken with these packages as with more valuable ones, and the recipient, after his package amongst a few hundreds has been picked out by its number from a table, has to sign the receipt book. Inquiry at the office brought forth the fact that the portfolios are liable to duty at 15 percent, and as they cost ten cents each with coupons, the duty was levied on the amount of cash received. As the promoters of the scheme on a morning contemporary had not paid the duty, the coupon clippers had to do so. Modern Discoveries and the Bible. The results of the work of the two great societies (Palestine and Egypt Exploration Fund), organized a few years ago to dig among the ancient ruins of Assyria, Babylonia, Egypt, and Palestine, will be given in the Fraser Institute tonight at 8 o'clock by the Rev.

Canada suffered comparatively little from the blizzard or blizzards that played havoc with life, limb, and property in the United States and Europe the other day. Score one more for the National Policy of Canada. Joseph Ruby, son of Harry K. Ruby, of Columbia, Pa., suffered from birth with a severe form of scrofula humor. "Until my boy was six years of age, he was from birth a terrible sufferer from scrofulous humor. Sores would appear on him and grow to as large as a dollar and then discharge, followed by others, so that the larger part of his body was one mass of sores all the time, especially severe on his leg and back of his ears and on his head. The humor had a very offensive odor and caused intense itching. We cannot tell how that poor boy suffered in all those years. Physicians did not effect a cure. At last, I decided to give him Hood's Sarsaparilla, as my druggist recommended it. In about two weeks, the Sarsaparilla began to have an effect. The sores commenced to heal up; the flesh began to look more natural and healthy. Then the scabs came off and all over his body new and healthy flesh and skin formed. When he had taken two bottles, he was entirely free from sores, having only the scars.' Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

1894-02-27: NATIONAL DRINK BILLS. Dr. Dawson Burns, a temperance statistician well known in Great Britain, has got out the "drink bill" of the United Kingdom for 1893. In that year, the British public consumed 1,137,385,000 gallons of beer, 37,727,823 gallons of spirits, and 14,104,771 gallons of wine, in addition to a quantity of British wines estimated at fifteen million gallons, the total expenditure amounting to £138,854,829 or nearly seven hundred million dollars. More beer was drunk in 1893 than in 1892, but spirits and wines show a considerable falling off; the net decrease in expenditure in intoxicants amounted to about ten million dollars, a drop of 1.3 per cent on the drink bill of 1892. On average, every person in the United Kingdom spent 3s 12d in intoxicants during the year as against 3s 13d in 1892, and 3s 15d in 1891. A similar decrease has taken place in Canada during the last few years, and for the last twenty years our expenditure in intoxicants has only been about one-third per head of the amount spent in the old country. In 1892, Canadians spent on average about $5 each as against $17.34 in the United Kingdom. An equally striking difference is to be noted in the amount of liquor consumed. The inhabitants of England drank nearly a barrel of beer (36 gallons) per head during the past year; Scotland, 13 gallons; Ireland, 10 gallons; Canada, less than 3.5 gallons. In spirit drinking, the Scotsman stands far away at the head of the list, his proportion being 1.67 gallons, as against 1.04 for the Irishman, 0.88 for the Englishman, and 0.74 for the Canadian. In wine, the Canadian also shows up the best from the temperance point of view, the average consumption being 0.85 in England, 0.50 in Ireland, 0.49 in Scotland, and 0.09 in Canada. Altogether, England spent in intoxicants during the year $18.09 per head, Scotland $14.15, Ireland $10.26, and Canada about $5, prices being reckoned on the same basis as in the English returns. Whichever way we look at the figures, it is evident that Canada drinks less and spends less on drink than any portion of the old country. Temperance feeling is stronger here, and keeps drinking customs in check to a greater extent. The amount of beer the average Englishman drinks in a year is something enormous. The returns give 35 gallons per head, but it must be remembered that in arriving at this average, women, children, and teetotalers are all counted. Half the population of England must drink no beer, or next to none; and that means that the other half consume 70 gallons of beer per head in a year, more than a pint and a half for every day in the year. The explanation is to be found in the old-established English custom of drinking beer to dinner and supper, which does not prevail in Canada to anything like the same extent. When a Canadian wants a drink, he generally gets it in a saloon; while in the old country, there are men who drink gallons in the course of a year, but would be ashamed to be seen in a public house. Religious feeling is also very much more in favor of temperance in Canada than it is in Great Britain. Here nearly all clergymen are abstainers. Among the clergy of the Church of England in the old country, there are very few teetotallers, and among the Nonconformists, the proportion is probably not as high as it is in Canada. The religious sentiment with regard to intoxicants has its influence upon society, and wine probably plays a less important part in social functions than at home. In all these points, the old country is following in our footsteps, but at the present rate of progress, it will be a very long time before Great Britain reaches the position with regard to temperance that Canada occupies today. The idea that one Britisher is good enough for 600 niggers is bound to receive a setback now and then, when the tribes dealt with are bold and crafty, and armed with modern weapons. That is probably the explanation of the defeat of a small British force in Gambia, which apparently trusted more to the luck of the British army than to efficient arrangements for its own protection. The Chief Fodisilah, who has had the glory of the victory, will probably come to repent his triumph. In dealing with a power like that of the British Crown, it is cheaper for savage races to take a beating quietly in the first instance. An African chief can hardly be expected to refrain from wiping out a few British troops when he has the chance, especially if they interfere with his capture and sale of niggers, but a high price has to be paid for these little diversions afterwards. A much more powerful expedition is going on the track of the former, just to straighten things up a bit, and Chief Fodisilah will probably end like Cete-wayo or Lobengula. The English advisers of the Khedive are going on steadily with the reform of Egyptian administration, and already considerable progress has been made. Instead of judges gaining their seats by bribery and favoritism, and administering justice on the same lines, only competent men are appointed, and if they do not keep straight, they are sent about their business. The courts of summary jurisdiction, which have been established both for civil and criminal cases, have brought justice within the reach of the poor, and the improvement of the system has been manifested both in the increase of the relative proportion of convictions and the decrease of actual crime, especially of highway robbery. Whatever the Khedive may think of the British administration, his subjects will be sorry to lose the boons of security of life and property, and even-handed justice for rich and poor alike. Paris has suffered from some dangerous crazes, but none so decidedly uncomfortable for respectable citizens as the Anarchist fever, which has apparently seized on a section of the populace. There is not a more dangerous section of society anywhere than the rabble of the French capital. They have just intelligence enough to take up crazy ideas, and their brains seem to be set on fire in an instant. An Anarchist epidemic will be even more difficult to be dealt with than the destructive revolutionary outbreaks which have again and again threatened to lay waste one of the most beautiful cities of the world. The official returns of the prohibition plebiscite in Prince Edward Island show 10,585 votes for to 3,331 against. The total parliamentary vote in Prince Edward Island at the last parliamentary election was 24,057. The vote cast was about 18,500. The plebiscite only brought out about 14,000. Barely 44 percent of the total declared for prohibition, and though this no doubt represents at least one-half of the available vote, it does not promise that provincial prohibition would be more effective on the island than was the Scott Act. A Dr. Samuel Green has discovered that the word "blizzard," generally supposed to have originated in Dakota, dates back to the seventeenth century. As this was long before Dakota had a name, it follows that the originator of the word must have had Dakota in his prophetic eye. Else he could not have so well designed a name to fit Dakota's peculiar climatic product. In his valedictory address yesterday, Hon. Mr. Desjardins referred to a former occupant of the mayor's chair who claimed credit for all the good legislation of the council, and laid the blame for all that was bad on the aldermen. Perhaps Ex-Mayor McShane could recall the name of the gentleman in question. Last night saw Patti's farewell performance in Montreal. That, at any rate, is what the advertisements said; but Patti has a way of her own of disregarding her advertisements, that encourages the hope that she may give us many more farewells, and get paid for them. If Mr. Wiman is wise, he will stop giving out explanations of his case. The effect of those he has so far delivered is to make people who read them wonder why, amid so many words, he does not deny the accusations against him. The cheering news comes from Quebec that no ice bridge has formed at Cape Rouge this winter. This gives promise of an early opening of navigation, and will make all good Montrealers rejoice. The signs of spring are showing themselves just now, chiefly in the wholesale millinery shops. And they are gorgeous. BIRTH: Quinn.

1894-03-30: A HAPPY HOME. A Successful Settler's Story About the Canadian Northwest. To the Editor of the Gazette: Sir, I came to the Northwest in the autumn of 1883. My object was to see whether a man in my position, with impaired health, limited means, and a large family, could likely live and rear a family in a fairly respectable way. I was favorably impressed with the beauty and fertility of many places I examined, from Southern Manitoba to the Sturgeon River, north of Edmonton, but Red Deer, for several reasons, suited me best then, and suits me still. This is, to a great extent, purely a matter of fancy. In so vast a country, with such varied and abundant resources and possibilities, it is quite impossible for any one locality to monopolize all the good things; all those who make such a claim may well be suspected of sinister motives. I returned in April, 1884, with a wife and ten children, a man and maid servant and nurse girl, and am living on the spot where I first drove down my tent pins. At that time there was no railway north of Calgary. Our household effects, farm implements, and supplies had to be carted in by half-breed freighters at 1.5 cents per pound; and our cattle were driven the 100 miles from Calgary in such daily stages as they could stand, grazing by the way, the young men with a team, tent, and supplies camping wherever night overtook them. Then there were no people in the country with the exception of some half-dozen whites and a few half-breed families. What is now known as the Red Deer district, reaching from south of Innisfail to north of Lacombe, was an uninhabited desert. There was not one post office between Calgary and Edmonton, 200 miles; no school, except on Indian missions, and only a fitful existence there; no minister of the gospel or church for the 200 miles from Calgary to Edmonton, and east and west many hundred miles. If there were really any very dark days in the experience of a veteran settler, these might have been counted on as the days of gloom. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

---

From the hardship, compared with which the present is an advanced stage of civilization. But there was no chance of winning a martyr's crown. We were agreeably disappointed. The hardships were not nearly as many or great as we expected, the comforts more. Away from the rush and whirl of city life, where head and heart were full of care, and every nerve at the utmost tension, the quiet of the forests and the charm of nature seemed like the very hush of God, and everywhere was "peace." We set to work to rear our log shanty. We could indulge in very little lumber; lumber was a luxury: common sawed boards cost $30 per thousand, but mud was cheap, and with a plentiful supply inside and out we managed to make a warm, if not handsome, habitation; and having pictures in our minds and music in ourselves, we learned that happiness is not a matter of grand houses or luxurious furniture; but love and confidence, and a common and high purpose to succeed in spite of all obstacles. We had faith in God, and a whole lot of faith in ourselves. We went to work with a will, getting up in the morning, contrary to the habit of many in these days, and staying with it all day. We had no post office to drive to, taking a day each week, and no hotel with its bar and billiards to take another day, and few persons with whom to discuss politics, weather, and crop prospects; so that the terrible tax of fifty percent upon our productive energy, a tax that would drive a man into anarchy if done by any but himself, was all saved up and devoted to the very commonplace but important task of getting bread, and we made a living and kept up out of the mud. We had much to encourage our industry. The soil was rich and productive, the climate, in my judgment, the best in Canada. That does not say that we have not at times severely cold weather. Nor does it say that we can grow all the vegetables, or many of the fruits that can be grown successfully in some other parts of Canada. But the atmosphere is dry, the winters are short, many of them very mild, so that cattle and horses are absolutely independent of the stall, except, of course, working teams or milch cows. Hay, however, is abundant, so that in more severe winters, or a cold rain, or storm in mild winters, feed is abundant, and no loss need ever occur. The springs are early as a rule. There is a vast preponderance of bright weather. The autumns are long and delightful. The rainfall is under the average for Canada, but for the ten years we have been here we have had no approach to a killing drought. There are few severe storms, no blizzards, nor hot winds. Taken all round, it is a delightful, healthy climate. We have rich and abundant pasturage, pure water, a good supply of wood, an inexhaustible supply of coal. These are some of the natural advantages which seduced us in the early days, and our love for the country has not decreased with the years. As civilization has come to us in the forms of post office, school, church, society, railway, law and order, open accessible markets, the best around prices for farm produce anywhere that I hear or read of, why should I think less of this great inheritance which God has given loyal Canadians, and the people of all the earth who are willing to become loyal Canadians, part of the greatest empire on earth? The country still has room for bona fide farmers, with a little capital, and a whole lot of sense and push, and stay-with-it-ness; but for adventurers, ne'er-do-wells, and birds of passage, there is no room. It is particularly adapted to mixed farming, possessing every known condition for successful dairying. I am persuaded there is no better country open for settlement today.

A Boy Horned to Death  
Port Colborne, Ont., March 29  
The residence of Ernst Pietz, a farmer living in the township of Humberstone, about four miles east of here, was destroyed by fire about 11 o'clock last night, and a hired boy, 15 years of age, name unknown, who came from near Buffalo, was burned to death. Mr. Pietz and his little girl were also badly burned. The fire was discovered by Mrs. Pietz, who was sick in bed, and she aroused the household; but owing to the headway of the fire the boy was unable to get out. The cause of the fire is unknown, but it is thought to have been owing to some defect in the pipes, natural gas being used for fuel.

Improve American Harbor  
Washington, March 29  
The River and Harbor bill will be reported to the House tomorrow. It carries an appropriation for the fiscal year ending 1895 in round numbers of about $6,500,000, which is $12,000,000 less than the appropriation for the current fiscal year and $30,000,000 less than the estimate submitted by the United States engineers. Charlotte gets $15,000; Ogdensburg, $20,000; Oswego, $27,000; Tonawanda harbor and Niagara river, $50,000; Great Chazy, for completion, $3,000; Patchogue, $4,000; and $8,000 to be expended for improving shoals between Sisters Islands and Oswego Light, and in the St. Lawrence River between Ogdensburg and the foot of Lake Ontario.

"Every inch of the new cable will be tested with 5,000 volts before it is shipped, and you will appreciate the test when I tell you that our ordinary working power is 50 volts only. When I was in England to illustrate the reliability of this insulation I saw a piece of our cable subjected to a current of 25,000 volts, and there was not the slightest sign of a breakdown. Much of the efficiency we have attained is due to the automatic transmitter. The Commercial was the first cable company to successfully introduce automatic work in long distance cables. We have made many improvements since it was first employed, and now we have the best submarine automatic cable apparatus in the world. It saves time, and every minute is worth $5. With the automatic transmitter every letter is distinct, and the probability of error is reduced to a minimum. How many miles of cable does the Commercial company own? Well, the new cable is about twenty-one hundred miles in length. That will make the company's system nearly ten thousand miles long. We began business on December 24, 1884, at a tariff of 20 percent lower than that previously existing. A tariff war followed, and it lasted eighteen months, but we earned our point, and a rate of 25 cents was agreed upon by all the companies. It had been 50 before we entered the field. We have greatly increased the speed and accuracy of submarine telegraphy. We have not only shown that messages can be sent from New York to London in a minute or two, but we claim the quickest time on record. A question has been asked in New York and an answer has been received from London in 45 seconds. 

SUPERIOR ADVANTAGES  
"The Commercial company brought the cable directly into New York, and that has been of immense benefit when the land lines have been interrupted. Take the time of the great blizzard, for instance. The wires between New York and Boston were down, and the only communication between the two cities was by Commercial cable to Canso, N.

'Bo'sun oh, Bo'sun, just look at the green of it!  
Look at the red rattles blown by the hedge!  
Look at the farms leading, all that is seen of it,  
One little gable-end over the edge!'  
'Lord, hear the tongues of them, clattering, chattering,  
All going wild at a peep of the sight!  
Ah, Mr. Wave! It has set them all chattering,  
Thinking of home and their mothers tonight!'  
'Sprea the top-gallants, oh, lay them out lustily!  
What though it darken o'er Netherby Combe?  
'Tis but the valley-wind pulling so gustily  
On for the Warner and Hayling and home!  
'Bo'sun, oh, Bo'sun, just see the long slope of Culver!  
Is there, with the cliff and the light?  
Tell us, oh, tell us, now is there a hope of it,  
Shall we have leave for our homes for tonight?'  
'Tut! tut! the clack of them! Steadily, steadily!  
Aye, as you say, sir, they're little ones still.  
One long reach should open it readily,  
Round by St. Helen's and under the hill.  
Hast it and the Nab are the gates of the promise,  
Their mothers to them and to us.  
It's our wives, I've called forty years and,  
By God, it's upon us! Reef royals! Reef topsails!  
Reef, reef for your lives!'  
A grey swirl of snow with the squall at the back of it,  
Reeling her, beating her down!  
A gleam of her bends in the thick of the wrack of it,  
A flutter of white in the eddies of brown!  
It broke in one moment of blizzard and blindness,  
The next, like a foul bat, it flapped on its way.  
But our ship and our boys! Gracious Lord,  
In Your kindness, give help to the mothers who need it today!  
Give help to the women who wait by the water,  
Who stand on the hard, with their eyes past the light.  
Ah, whisper it gently, you sister or daughter:  
'The boys are all gathered at home for tonight.'"

A. Conan Doyle, in The London Speaker  

Evolution of the Daughters  
A great deal of the ill health of our delicate girls arises from repression of their young energy. The boys, too, would be hysterical if their youth were hedged in with so many conventional restraints that there would be no room left for self-restraint, if everything they wore, every word they spoke, every youthful grace and beauty, every intellectual endowment, were habitually looked upon and openly spoken of as making them more saleable articles. These things belong only to the ages of slavery, and I would once and for all protest that where there is a "market," marriage in its true sense cannot be said to exist. Marriage is the free union of the free, taking upon themselves such limitations of their freedom as will lead them into the highest realms of liberty. Liberty implies law, discerned to be the best for ourselves and our neighbors, the guarantee of a personal and national freedom. This is the sort of freedom, this is the sort of liberty, which has become a part of the Englishman's very self-consciousness, and it is the same liberty which our girls are claiming, and taking, and are using well. It seems certain that the result must be to restrain the license into which men have turned their liberty. In building the logical union that must give to a nation free women to stand by free men, our English girls are also carrying on the destined work of England for the world. With grievous and daring exceptions, the example and influence of England have, on the whole, brought hope and light and order to brutalized and enslaved nations, at least to the men of those nations. Here and there, even in the darkest recesses of paganism, a hint, a gleam of the freedom which Christianity means for women, has reached the most downtrodden and tortured of the women of the world. They groan with a new apprehension of their misery, and it will lie in the hands of our daughters, freed themselves, to carry freedom to other women.

Three starters in this race; there were only three starters, Morpheus and Come Home having been scratched. Stonemason, Blizzard, and Tom Flynn went to the post, the former at about evens and Colonel Strathy's horse selling as high as 7 to 1. They went away without a moment's delay, with Blizzard on the rail and Stonemason in the center. Blizzard fell behind three-eighths up the back stretch. It was a pretty race between Stonemason and Tom Flynn. Coming to the stretch, Flynn went back and Blizzard came along. They were all whipping except Stonemason. He was pulled up by three lengths. This was Seagram's second win of the day and both horses were ridden by Regan. Everybody seemed to have Stonemason and the books lost heavily.

Blizzard led the bunch around the top where some began to fall behind. Mirage drew up a few notches coming into the stretch, but it was Blizzard's race all the way. The betting was 8 to 1 against the winner, 3 to 1 against Mirage, and 5 to 1 against Kaponga. Unamunka was the favorite and heavily played at from 7 to 5 to 2 to 1, but was never heard from.

Wind Up of a Great Meeting of the Ontario Jockey Club  
RACES AT THE ROYAL FAIR

General and Miscellaneous Sporting  
(From our own correspondent)  
Toronto, Ont., May 29. The last day of the Ontario Jockey Club races was the brightest of the meeting, and the track was in better condition than it has been for a couple of weeks. An immense crowd was in attendance, and taking all in all, the meeting from a financial standpoint has been more successful than was anticipated a week ago. This was about the most successful day of the meeting for the bookmakers, and although they did not make much out of the first five days, they pulled in some rich hauls today. The races resulted as follows:

**FIRST RACE**  
Norway Purse $400, for all ages, of which $75 to second horse and $25 to third.  
Entry fee, $5; 1 mile.

2 Gonzales, F. Poague's b h, 3, by Cheviot - Carried, 115 lbs (Doane)  
Blizzard, Laurel, Two Lips, Coltonade, Penniless, Moican, and Mercury also started.  
Time, 1:15.  

Gonzales got away in front with Stonemason second, Polydora third. At the quarter, Polydora showed in front and Stonemason, the favorite, who carried a bunch of public money, was still second and Gonzales third. Coming home, Stonemason went to the front, but Polydora beat him out by a neck in the drive. Gonzales was third by another neck. It was a furious finish. The betting was: Stonemason, 4 to 6; Polydora, 3 to 1; Gonzales, 10 to 1; Coltonade, 5 to 1; Blizzard, 8 to 1; and others as high as 100 to 1.

4 to 1 60 to 1 Lancashire Witch  
1 to 1 6 to 1 Two Lips  
6 to 1  

**THE RACE**  
There was a little trouble in starting, principally due to the halting of Recherche and Lancashire Witch. When they finally got away, Lancashire Witch was in the lead with Two Lips a close second. Royal George was in third place, with the remainder behind. This order continued to the home stretch, when Coltonade moved up and by degrees was forced ahead of Lancashire Witch, and won a good race by two lengths. Blizzard had his nose at the Witch's flank.  

**SECOND RACE**  
The Queen's Plate of fifty guineas. The Gift of Her Majesty. For horses owned, bred, raised, and trained in the province of Quebec, and that have never won public money added to a sweepstakes of $50 early half forfeited. The first horse to receive the guineas and stakes; $100 added by the club, of which $70 to second and $30 to third. One mile and a quarter.

**18940616: CANADIAN CHAMPIONSHIPS**  
The Sporting Events, Yachting, Races, Baseball, Lacrosse, and Athletics. The second day of the Bel-Air races was very successful from a racing point of view, and two track records were smashed. The track was in excellent condition, and never has the course been in better order. The attendance was not very large, but the racing was of a high class, especially the steeplechase, which brought the day's sport to a close. There was more scratching done than on the previous day, but in every instance the finishes were close and interesting. Only four faced the flag in the Flash purse, but it was a rattling race, and it was any of the first three's until the post was passed. The Bel-Air handicap had a very small field of three starters, Belle of Orange and Coquette dividing the popular fancy. Through some mistake or other, Coquette was put down in the books at 110, and quite a lot of money went in on her. Then it was discovered that the card weights called for 122, so all bets were off and 20 minutes allowed to make new books. The Forest and Stream purse was a fine race once it got started, but it took nearly half an hour before the lot could get into anything like line, and then Lonely was left about three lengths behind. As the distance was a mile, the start was in front of the grandstand, and the spectators got a chance of seeing what difficulties a starter has to contend with. For almost half an hour was Mr. Poran's patience tried. Now it was Laurel, then it was Moican, and then Blizzard would take it into his head to divide his attention between standing still and trying to get off his jockey. Once they broke away, Lonely, Tom Flynn, and Balbriggan traveled nearly three-quarters of a mile before they pulled up. When the lot did eventually get away, Lonely justified his name, for he had no company. Blizzard made a splendid finish for second place, and just beat out Tom Flynn by a head. The Brokers' purse was an easy thing for the favorite, Coltonade winning in a gallop, while the St. James Handicap steeplechase was a splendid race all through, but the boys went broke on Coano, who fell at the second last jump when the race was all his own, letting Flip Flap in and V. M. and Garwood struggling for second place. The races on the whole were of the most satisfactory kind, and with the card arranged for today, the grandstand ought to be packed. The officials were: Judge, 46.  

**BETTING**  
To win Place, 4 to 1 7 to 6 30 to 1 Lonely.

**Mocan** 6 to 1  
**Ualbrlggan** 3 to 1  
**Bowstring** 6 to 1  
**Blizzard** 3 to 1  

Bowstring carried 6 lbs over. In this race, after an hour's attempts, the lot were sent off pretty well together with the exception of lonely Mocan. Blizzard and Laurel went neck and neck for the first eighth of a mile, closely followed by Tom Flynn. At the half, Balbriggian moved up to Laurel, and the order was Laurel, Balbriggian, Tom Flynn, the rest trailing out. Turning into the home stretch, Flynn and Laurel were allowing the way, all were whipping. Then Blizzard came along with a rush and just beat out Tom Flynn for second place by a head, Laurel winning by two lengths and making a record for the track, a quarter second better than Versatile's time.

**No. 4 Brokers' purse of $220**, of which $50 to second, for 3-year-olds and upwards; winners to be sold at auction; highest entered $200. Horses entered to be sold for less allowed 1 lb for each $100 down to $700 and 2 lbs for each $100 down to $200. No claims. Six furlongs.

**MONDAY JULY 2, 1891**  
**BEL-AIR SUMMER MEETING**  
Some Good Racing Signalized the Opening Day  
A VICTORY FOR MONTREAL

The midsummer meeting of the Bel-Air Jockey Club opened Saturday, and fine weather favored the grand sport. The attendance was small, and this is to be deeply regretted, as the Bel-Air club, for the interest taken in the turf, should receive better patronage. The races were as good as have been seen at the course for some time, and the few hundred present were thoroughly contented with the performances of the horses. The bookmakers did a fair business considering the quantity of talent and would have come out behind had they not retrieved something in the last race. 

**Roano** was backed heavily to win, but Dr. McTiannon's horse did not get better than fourth. Repartee was backed by a few knowing ones and paid good money. It was Dawes' day, as out of the five races his stable carried off three. Octoo won the Provincial handicap from a field of eight, and Royal George beat out Blizzard and Vassella in the St. James purse. The Iroquois purse went to Chamunka after a grand race, while Mr. Dawes' Laurel also took second in the trial purse, giving Balbriggian a good race. The favorite in this event, Wist, made a poor showing. The officials of the day performed their duties most efficiently. They were: Judge R. R. Pringle, Starter H. P. Dawes.

**Ch. c. Royal George**, 3, by Onondaga-Lady Caroline, 100 lbs. White 1  
**J. Tribe's ch. b. Blizzard**, by Eole-Belpheobe, 116 lbs. Harrison 2  
**Owner's ch. m. Vassella**, 8, by Vassal-Stella, 121 lbs. Muluus 3  
**Time**: 1:43 1/5. 

In the race, Royal George went to the fore as soon as the nag dropped, and Blizzard started in second place. The race was not too dull, and Royal George could not be overtaken. He finished in a canter several lengths ahead of Blizzard, who had it easy for second from Vassella.

**Fourth Race: Iroquois purse**, $300, of which $60 to second and $25 to third. Winner to be sold at auction for $200. If for more, 4 lbs added for each $100 up to $1,000. No claims. Entrance $10, half forfeit. Seven furlongs.

**18940703**: Balbriggian attempted to get through the field but he was hemmed in. Going round the top turn, Wist went to the lead and finished easily, Chamunka second with Balbriggian a good third. Out of six entries, there were only three starters in the Dominion Day Handicap. Little of Orange was clearly outpaced by her stable companion Royal George. It was a Dawes' race, and Blizzard was out of it. Each jockey did his best to win, but the battle was a failure. The Maple Leaf purse got a field of four starters, but there was nothing in the race but Laurel and Balbriggian, and they won at will. The Midsummer Handicap steeplechase was a win for an outsider. Tom Flynn was an 8 to 10 shot and led for the first mile when, by a fluke, Roseland and Repartee went to the lead. After this, both went down and Flynn won easily. In the final race, even the bookmakers would not touch Wanderer II, and this animal won in a canter. The summaries follow:

**Breeze purse**: Purse $200, of which $56 to second; for all ages. Winner once this year, if twice, 7 lbs extra; non-winners this year allowed 7 lbs; maidens allowed 10 lbs. Allowances not to be accumulative. Entrance $10, half forfeit. Five furlongs.  
1. Tribe's b. c. Wirt, 4, 129 lbs. Harrison 1  
2. J. P. Dawes' ch. g. Royal George, 3, 110 lbs. White 1  
3. J. P. Dawes' b. m. Belle of Orange, 6, 121 lbs. Brennan 2  
4. J. Tribe's ch. b. Blizzard, 8, 114 lbs. Morrison 3  
**Time**: 2:16. 

**Maple Leaf purse** of $260, of which $75 to second; Dominion bred horses allowed 7 lbs; one mile.

**18940801**: **TROTTING at Boston**  
Boston, July 31. The four days' meeting at Franklin Park opened today with a good crowd and good racing.  
**Summaries**: 2:16 class, pacing, purse $100: Blizzard, 1; Ben D, 2; Walter Roberts, 3; Merry Legs, 4. Best time: 2:10.

**This was not the only comment upon the interview.** "Outis," a contributor to the Telegraph, wrote about it in this fashion: "Some of the particulars of his experience abroad, disclosed by Sir Thomas to his latest interviewer, were pretty steep, especially those relating to the weather. They remind one of the fine touches of exaggeration on this head with which the man who drops in at the corner grocery and munches crackers out of a barrel, as described in current American literature, wins the admiration of the boys. This subject of weather has some sort of fascination for Australian visitors to North America. Our Sir Arthur Benwick had a thrilling tale to tell of how in his office at Chicago it took several men to write a letter because one had to unthaw the ink and another to prevent the pen from freezing to the paper or something of that kind. But Sir Thomas McIlwraith brings Queensland well ahead in his veracity. Between the Rocky Mountains and Winnipeg, he says, the night temperature was 40.3 below zero. The car conductor's thermometer showed 43 below, but Sir Thomas doesn't wish to take any risks! So he goes by his own. This instrument, he further mentions, showed that at 2 o'clock in the day, and when exposed to the sun, the temperature was 11 below zero. Now if one takes 100 off that, the remainder will show something like the degree of intense and phenomenal cold reached in the terrible blizzard nights when human beings are frozen to death within a few yards of their homes. A few hours of life at 10 below zero leaves an imperishable memory of the occasion on the minds of those who survive, and the report that Greely's expedition close to the awful region of the North Pole experienced cold down to nearly 80 below zero was generally discredited as being beyond what life could bear. Sir Thomas, who has really endured another 60 below even that, is the one man in this world who should be allowed to go out and look around the earth's axis in the interests of science." 

More satisfactory were Sir Thomas' statements about the Canadian route and his experiences in the Dominion. He declared himself to be very favorably impressed with the Canadian route to the mother country. It is, he declared, by far the pleasantest of any, and when Aird, Tuddart's splendid new steamships, now being built for the Atlantic portion of the route, are running, nothing beyond pond ships on the Pacific will be requisite to secure for it by far the larger portion of the passenger traffic between Australia and Europe. Sir Thomas is perfectly satisfied that the Canadian route from Southampton via Halifax to New York will be appreciably quicker than the Liverpool and New York direct route. He, therefore, feels assured that the service will be a success. Sentiment, he thinks, will go a long way to make the Canadian route popular with Australians, for there is a solid comfort in the reflection that via Canada the Australian can travel all the way to London on a British ship or on British soil. One feels at home among his own people, he says, in Canada; but on crossing the American border, one is immediately conscious of a foreign atmosphere, so to speak. Sir Thomas had not much new to add to the prospects of reciprocal trade between Canada and Australia. The Canadians would become large consumers of frozen meat if we would accept their fish and timber in exchange. If a well-appointed steamship service were maintained, it would at first have to depend chiefly on passenger traffic; but if freights were moderate, there is no doubt that a large cargo business would be gradually developed to the mutual advantage of both peoples. The Pacific cable project is, of course, about to be considered at the conference at Ottawa, and Sir Thomas McIlwraith was disinclined to say more than that he is in favor of the undertaking, and he does not think it matters much whether the British Government joins in the subsidy or not, as the cable is certain to become remunerative. But he favors it being entirely under joint Government control.

**Killed by a Trolley Car**  
Hamilton, Out., October 8. Trolley car No. 41, going east, at noon today, ran down and killed Robert Welshman, a salesman employed at the Oak Hall clothing store. Welshman was mounted on a bicycle and attempted to cross the track in front of the car at the corner of River and Catherine streets, but either misjudged the car's distance or its speed. The motorman stopped the car within 60 feet, but both wheels passed over Welshman's chest and he died almost instantly. Deceased was about 30 years of age and leaves a widow and two children, who reside on Eckman Avenue. 

**Snow in Minnesota and Dakota**  
Minneapolis, October 8. North Dakota, portions of South Dakota, and the northern border of Minnesota are buried under a heavy fall of snow. The storm, which in some localities has developed into a blizzard, began yesterday morning, and every indication points to a repetition of the blizzard of fourteen years ago.

North and east of the Bettle district around Quebec City, the purpose is to make the park a place for the preservation of large game and the study of forest growth. A smaller tract in the township of Grandison, in the eastern part of the province, has also been set apart as a sanctuary. The Government's action will receive general commendation. Ontario, a few years ago, took a similar step, which was in line with the action of the Dominion in instituting the Banff National Park, and was widely praised. The Ontario park area has also been added to since it was created. There is much land, not suitable for agriculture, which could not be put to better purpose. The generation of today has learned that there is health in the forest primeval, and there will be few better samples of it than are included in Quebec's Laurentides Park. It will be sure to bring visitors, for it is not only large and attractive, but it is easily reached.

Conservatives in London, where the election contest has waxed very hot, find fault with Mr. Hobbs, the Liberal candidate, because he is a very poor speaker. The charge appears to be just one. It is doubtful, though, if its establishment will do Mr. Hobbs much harm. Usually, when a Liberal is nominated for a parliamentary or legislative vacancy, his ability to add to the "debating power" of the party is heralded as one of his main qualifications. A few Liberals have gotten into Parliament, and the printed debates have, as a consequence, swollen into two immensely bulky volumes that nobody reads, so that nobody knows exactly what they are all about. A Liberal representative who knows enough not to talk may take with the electors, as a novelty.

The pedestrian Wilson, who left his boots in Montreal, just beyond Winnipeg, met a snowstorm which landed him in a ditch where he was glad to stay for an hour. He describes it as "a blizzard," but the inhabitants say it was "only a light wind." Anyhow, it was quite enough to knock Mr. Wilson out for the time being and give him a little foretaste of what he may expect later on. At the time of writing, Mr. Wilson had done 1,743 miles from Quebec, and one-fifth of his journey round the world. He will not do the next few hundred miles so easily. The beginning of winter is not a good time to start a big walking tour in the far West. A writer from Georgeville in the Waterloo Advertiser, in commending Mr. Rideout, the Liberal M.P., suggests...

November 20, 1894: A blizzard prevails throughout northern New York tonight. The mercury here registers ten below zero, while the wind is blowing almost a gale, filling the air with light snow that has recently fallen. New York, November 19: New York harbor is being swept tonight by a gale blowing at the rate of 55 miles an hour. Up to midnight, no damage to vessels has been reported.

December 27, 1894: H. Warren, of the Boston Custom House, was today suspended from duty by a special order from Washington pending an investigation of alleged misconduct on his part while on Government business in the British provinces. The seizure and search of the fishing schooner Albert George on October 2 last for alleged smuggling merchandise with which Inspector Warren had considerable to do figured in the case.

BEAUTIFUL COMES DOWN: A snowstorm which visited this city tonight was heavy enough to make possible the first sleighing of the season, and at 8 o'clock the jingle of sleigh bells could be heard in Central Park. Baltimore, December 26: The first snowstorm of the season was extraordinarily heavy. The flakes began to fall early in the afternoon, and sleighs were running throughout the city by nightfall. Late at night, the wind subsided and the snowfall was succeeded by a heavy rainstorm. Philadelphia, December 20: The first snow of the winter began to fall here this afternoon and in a few minutes a small-sized blizzard had developed. About 7 o'clock, the snow changed to a driving sleet storm, and at midnight the hail was still coming down as fiercely as when it began. Reports from all sections of the state show that the storm was general, and for the first time this winter, the country is covered with snow.

St. Paul, December 20: The first Arctic wave of winter came down on St. Paul this evening. The range of temperature over the Northwest was from zero at St. Paul to 20 below at Qu'Appelle, Canada. The barometer at the latter point has reached the high level of 31.20. Signal Service Officer Lyons reports that temperatures ranging from 20 to nearly 40 below zero will be registered over the Northwest tomorrow morning. No moderation is expected before Friday.

Cincinnati, December 20: Reports to the Tribune show that a heavy snow is falling throughout southern Ohio and Indiana, all of Kentucky and West Virginia. In the mountain sections of the last two states, there is great rejoicing as it will probably cause a big rise in the rivers, thus letting out the immense log rafts that have been accumulating for months. The snow ranges from six to twelve inches in depth and is drifting badly.

Chicago, December 20: Snow began falling in this city tonight but abated toward midnight. A high wind prevailed, and the thermometer fell to 20 degrees above zero. Reports from Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Michigan say that snowfalls prevail in those states.

One reported a lively time. General in the South, Quebec, December 27 (Special): The most violent storm experienced here for many years set in this morning and raged throughout the remainder of the day. There are heavy snowdrifts in the streets, and it is impossible at times to see from one side of a street to the other. Several people have been blown off their feet, and even vehicles in exposed situations have been overturned by the blizzard. Part of the roof of the Custom House was blown off this afternoon, and so was that of the Quebec and Lake St. John Railway workshops. The chimney of Gourdeau's factory was blown down, breaking in some three-fourths of the roof. The Levis ferry service had to be suspended, and the firemen were called out any number of times by alarms for chimney fires. Trains are delayed on all the railways. Some of the electric light poles, carrying the wires with the light into the city from Montmorency, were blown down tonight by the blizzard, throwing the whole city into darkness.

Toronto, December 27 (Special): Notwithstanding the very plain prediction of Old Probs, the Street Railway Company was caught napping this morning, for it was eight o'clock before the cars were running on anything like scheduled time. Residents in the North and West ends of the city were surprised that the company had not made better preparations for the storm, which knocked out the service for three hours, at a time when the cars were most needed.

In other Canadian points: December 27: A snowstorm, almost equal to the famous blizzard of 1888, has been raging in the Mohawk Valley since last night, with about 18 inches of snow falling. It has drifted badly, and Central Hudson and West Shore trains are from three to four hours late, and some of them have been abandoned. No freights have been run today. The Empire State Express, west-bound, was nearly two hours late when it reached this city. The storm is still raging.

Watertown, N.Y., December 27: The worst blizzard of recent years has raged here today. A fine snow has fallen to the depth of twenty inches, and the wind has piled it into huge drifts. The streetcars have ceased running, and trains are from one to five hours late. The country roads are completely blocked. The weather is very cold.

Fonda, N.Y., December 27: A ferocious blizzard from the northeast is howling through the town at the rate of 52 miles an hour. The streets are filled with drifts this morning, four feet high, where the dust was lying last night. Streetcars are stalled, and all morning trains are reported from two to four hours late.

Watertown, N.Y., December 27: The first heavy snowstorm of the season began here about ten last night, developing into a blizzard this morning. The average depth of the snowfall is about two feet. No trains have arrived or departed from Watertown up to 11 a.m.

New York, December 27: A fierce storm prevailed here last night. Up to midnight, about six inches of snow fell. A heavy rain then set in, and this morning the streets were filled with slush. At 11 a.m., light rain was still falling.

In other states: Cape Girardeau, MO, December 27: The worst snowstorm that has occurred in this section for years raged here for more than twelve hours yesterday, accompanied by a severe northwest gale.

Memphis, TN, December 27: Three inches of snow fell here yesterday afternoon, the thermometer registering 29. The storm was general throughout the South.

Baltimore, December 27: Snow, sleet, and rain, alternately throughout the night, filled the streets with slush and impeded traffic.

Portland, ME, December 27: A blizzard prevails here. The streets are practically deserted.

Hazleton, PA, December 27: The storm raged furiously here this afternoon. Traffic is at a standstill, freight and coal trains having been abandoned and passenger trains running two hours behind schedule. All collieries have suspended operations, throwing 20,000 men idle. Telephone and telegraphic service is paralyzed.

Shamokin, PA, December 27: At 7 o'clock last night, a snowstorm of blizzardic proportions began to rage and has done so continuously through eastern Pennsylvania ever since, almost as badly as the great storm of seven years ago when this region was blockaded for nearly a week and therefore isolated. Only local passenger trains are running, through trains on the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Jersey Central railroads being completely tied up by immense drifts which fill the mountain cuts. There is an entire blockade of every electric streetcar line, and traffic is at a standstill on all the city thoroughfares. All the schools are closed, pupils and teachers being unable to get to the buildings. There is enforced idleness at the mines throughout the entire region, railroads being unable to put cars into the breaker sidings, and there is every likelihood of a full week's idleness for the miners by reason of the storm. The snow continues, but the wind has abated somewhat, except on the Pocono mountains, where the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western officials report almost a gale, with the long Lehigh cut almost filled and high with snow swept in from the highlands.

A destructive flood is reported at Carbondale. Cavendish, N.G.: Wilkins suffered much loss. Several small boats belonging to him were torn loose from their moorings and have not been recovered, while several of his steam launches were capsized or sunk. Other vessels in that locality had their masts blown away and were otherwise injured. Henry J. Cloesterman, a well-known businessman, was struck by a falling tree while walking along Broadway and had a leg broken.

Sioux City, IA, December 27: An intense cold has prevailed here since yesterday morning, the mercury dropping from 60 above to 12 below.

St. Paul, December 27: This was the coldest day of the winter in Minnesota, the temperature ranging from 14 below zero at 7 a.m. to 4 below at 9 p.m. In the state, the range was from 5 below at Grand Rapids to 20 below at Stillwater. Not over two inches of snow has fallen at any point, and loggers are having serious trouble in the woods. No serious cases of suffering are reported. The cold is moderating rapidly.

West Bend, WI, December 27: The cold snap last night did not moderate today, and a sharp wind made traveling disagreeable. The thermometer was at 22 below zero at 2 p.m. and is still falling.

Chicago, December 27: Towards evening, the train service on the northern and western roads improved rapidly, and tonight the post office officials report mails from most sections of the country arriving about on time. On the eastern roads, however, the situation is not so favorable. All trains from that direction are from one to three hours late, and one train is reported leaving Cleveland for Chicago seven hours late.

St. Louis, December 27. A special to the Globe-Democrat from Guaymas, Mex., says that a band of Yaqui Indians visited the ranch of Julio Cardenas last Saturday and massacred him and his entire family, consisting of a wife and two children. A detachment of Government troops went in pursuit of the Indians, and it is reported that they came up with them and had a skirmish in which several of the Yaquis were killed.

A blizzard in the west was noted today as a bear argument on the Granger stocks, but as this is a periodical affair we cannot see why it should cut any figure. Cordage, after opening weaker, rallied somewhat, but people are as much in the dark as ever about this security. 

Reading was weak throughout. It was stated that the fours were coming in quite freely and that the Olcott-Karle committee would be sure to get a large majority of the 4 per cent bonds. Their success in this particular was responsible for the weakness in the stock at the close, inasmuch as should the plan be modified there is no doubt that an assessment will be levied on the stock.

Distillers stock was inactive during the morning hours but in the afternoon fell off sharply, one broker selling a round amount, parting with not less than 500 shares at a time. It looked as if a concerted movement had been made to catch stop orders in order to shake out the stock. 

The exchange market remains steady; exports next Saturday will not be large, if any. Withdrawals today from the sub-Treasury amounted to $500,000, which will undoubtedly be exported. The remaining two days of this week are likely to be very dull. Traders will probably even up their contracts in order to start the new year neither long nor short of the market.

London, December 27. Mines were the only active market today, and even these show signs of slackening. Americans were flat, closing, however, above the lowest. Consols and other investment stocks were strong on the prospect of cheap money in the new year. The decrease of gold in the Bank of England's coin and bullion this week was mainly due to the internal requirements of the Christmas trade. The external movements for the week were $42,000 in bar gold bought, $88,000 from Australia, and $60,000 from Paris, with $100,000 shipped to Bouman and $100,000 to the Cape.

The Bank of England's specie shows a decrease of $814,011. Three percent rentes in Paris closed at 101 francs and 80 centimes. The Bank of England rate was unchanged at 2 percent, and the open market discount rate was at 1 percent. Consols in London closed at 103 2/5 for money and 103 7/10 for the account. Canadian Pacific in London closed at 60. The Bank of France's specie shows an increase of 111,575,000 francs in gold and 150,000 francs in silver. The Bank of England gained on balance today $68,000. The local money market is unchanged. Call loans 4 percent, and mercantile discounts 6-8 percent. In New York, call money continues strong, closing higher today at 2 percent.

THE CURLING RINKS BUSY  
The America's Cup Question  
Park To Hoggans Slide Not to Be Opened  
General Sporting News.  

The American hockey players were not particularly impressed with the severity of the Canadian weather that greeted them on their arrival in this city yesterday; but a little drawback like a well-developed blizzard in no sense dampened the hospitality with which they were received. 

It was impossible to play the Shamrock hockey team as the snow had insinuated itself to the depth of a couple of feet on the ice of the Beaver rink, so the visitors put in their time with a little practice at the Victoria rink in the afternoon, then a lunch at the St. James Club, and in the evening again watched the local practices at the Victoria rink. As far as could be seen from the limited practice done, the American style of play is vastly different from the Canadian, but not as hard a game, and the features likely to be most noticeable in tonight's match will be a passing off-side game versus swift skating and heavy checking. 

To appreciate the difference, it will be necessary to see the game, which promises to be peculiarly instructive from the fact that one half will be played under American rules and one half under the Canadian rules with which we are all familiar. In conversation with a Gazette reporter last night, Mr. Chase was not slow to recognize the beauties of the Canadian game, but he still thought that the American style had some points worthy of consideration. 

As far as playing a match with the Shamrocks was concerned, he was not quite sure, but it was quite possible that it might take place on the return trip. He says our style of hockey is practically a revelation to him, judging from the practice matches he has seen. 

The American collegians are typical front men; they are here to spend a pleasant time and they are not above taking a hint as to the improvement of a game that they admire, but spectators will notice this evening that the distance between goals has been modified. This will be a distinct advantage to the visitors, as to a great extent it will do away with some of the benefits of foot skating, wherein Montrealers shine. 

The match between the Victorias and the American collegians will begin at 8 o'clock sharp, as the Victoria club has down on their program a little social supper which will take place after the match. 

Heretofore there has been some misunderstanding as to the composition of the American team, but the men who will play in tonight's match will be:  
Goal: Larned (Columbia)  
Point: Jones (Brown)  
Cover-point: Chase (Yale)  
Right-wing: Clarkson (Harvard)  
Left-wing: Matteson (Brown)  
Forwards: Meiklejohn (Brown) and Foote (Yale).  

The match will be two halves, the first American style and the second Canadian style. 

Practicing at the Victoria  
There were three very interesting practice matches at the Victoria rink last night. The Montreal team put in some good work from 7 to 8 o'clock, and they were followed by the Victoria intermediate team. After that, the Royal Scots had their turn on the ice, so that the Victoria rink altogether put in a pretty lively time last night. 

Ottawa Defeats Montreal  
Ottawa, December 27 (Special). The score in the first hockey match of the season tonight between Ottawa and Montreal ended in favor of Ottawa by 4 to 1. About 500 people were present and they seemed well pleased with the match, which was far from being up to championship form. There was slashing, bunting, and interfering enough to keep the spectators in good humor, but on the whole the contest was tame compared to anything the teams can do when battling for the championship. 

The first half went off in grand style, but in the second, want of practice told on both teams, which was to a great extent accountable for the quiet manner in which the battle was fought out towards the end. The match at all events was fairly won by Ottawa, but they had worthy opponents, particularly in the forward line, where honors were about even. On the defense, Ottawa had the advantage of such old-timers as Young and Falford, who seemed capable of resisting any attack. 

M. Giraud, the excellent comedian, made the best of the unsuitable part of the Drum Major. "La Fille du Tambour Major" will be repeated this and tomorrow evenings, and "Mlle L'Archiduc," with Mlle Bouitas, prima donna, will constitute the bill for tomorrow's matinee. 

The Theatre Royal  
For one week, commencing with Monday matinee December 31st, the attraction at the Theatre Royal will be Florence Bindley in her sensational comedy-drama, "The Captain's Mate." The play has, say the managers, received the unanimous verdict of press and public as one of the greatest successes of a dramatic lifetime. The plot is one of great interest, which is kept up from first to last. It is full of sensational climaxes, with witty dialogue and comedy running all through it. Incidental to the play, Miss Bindley will introduce her famous specialties, consisting of songs, dances, and musical specialties. The supporting company is a most excellent one and one that was specially engaged for the accurate portrayal of their different parts. The scenic and mechanical effects are most wonderful in construction and the acme of stage realism. The company carries an entire carload of scenery.

NEW YEAR'S DAY  
The Great Festive Season  
With French Canadians  
Where to Purchase Goodies  

What Christmas Day is to the Britisher, New Year's Day is to the French-Canadian. It is the day when he throws care to the winds and when worry bothers not his mind; it is the day when he is contented with himself and the world in general; it is the day when he and his family reunite and make merry. 

But in order to make merry in the true sense of the word, something more is needed than the mere assemblage of the several members of the family, however pleasing in itself such a gathering may be. Something additional is needed to gladden the heart, and that "something" can be obtained from Messrs. Dufresne & Mongenais, wholesale and family grocers, and importers of wines, cigars, etc., 221 St. James Street. 

The windows, which are appropriately decked with greenery, contain ready-made plum puddings, mince meat, prairie hens, quail, wild turkey—the last named at an especially low figure—and many other things that serve to convey to the mind some slight idea of what is to be found within, whilst over the door is a gas device indicating that G. H. Mumm's champagne can be purchased inside. 

On opening the door, the proverbial feast of good things meets the eye; cases of goods are piled up everywhere, bottles occupy shelves and corners, preserved fruits are prominent, and the several articles needed by materfamilias to make the first day of the new year thoroughly enjoyable are everywhere apparent. There are bon-bonnieres, French, Italian, and German delicacies, and Fry's and Cadbury's chocolates, all of which are more or less prominent on the family table at the season of rejoicing. 

There are also crystallized and glacial fruits, fruits of all kinds in syrup, fruits in maraschino, fruits in brandy, and fruits à la crème de vitalité. Then there are assorted fruits in brandy, some of the vessels containing them having a capacity of four gallons, and very tempting they look. Of pickled fruits, there is any amount of choice. Among the large assortment of French and German vegetables in glass may be mentioned a particularly fine lot of Perry's corn, carrots, asparagus, peas, and beans. 

In fresh fruits, as well as dried, there are all lines, and of English biscuits, there is a fine display, whilst the aroma of Dufresne & Mongenais' special blend of coffee as it is swiftly ground in the mill by electric power has a decidedly pleasing effect upon the olfactory senses and goes far towards convincing one of its popularity. 

And now, turning to what may be regarded as more in the line of after-dinner requisites, liqueurs occupy a prominent place, and all the well-known brands are to be found ad galore.

ictine, benedictine, curacao, maraschino, chartreuse, creme de menthe, absinthe Suisse and the celebrated Parisian novelty, grand marnier. In spirits, there are all the leading brands of brandies, from "one star" to the oldest and finest Hennessy; whiskies of all blends, sweet and dry gins, and the rums include St. James, St. George, and the famous Bell's Jamaica. Of wines, there is no lack: ports, sherries, Burgundies, sauternes, clarets, and Rhine wines of all aromas and degrees of dryness being piled up in abundance, whilst those who have a penchant for good old-fashioned beer can take their choice of all Canadian brands. Nor are those other solaces of the human nerves, cigars, cigarettes, and tobaccos, wanting. Towards the rear of the store is a large stock of those goods so dear to the heart of the smoker. There are all brands of Havana cigars; in fact, Messrs. Dufresne & Mongenais receive shipments direct every fortnight, whilst of the celebrated French cigarettes and French novelties they are the only importers in Canada. This department is under very able management, and in the goods it contains, the firm is doing a fast-increasing business. In passing, a word may be said about the cellar, which is stocked with all the liquid refreshments that the heart of man can well desire. A double row of immense casks runs from Fortification Lane to St. James Street. They contain imported wines and spirits of all blends and brands, and bins along the walls are filled with bottles of like imported goods, whilst carbonated and mineral waters, imported and otherwise, there is truly an abundance. In short, Messrs. Dufresne & Mongenais have laid themselves out for the New Year's trade, and a visit to their store on St. James Street will convince anyone of that fact.

18941229: TACHTINU Royal St. Lawrence Yacht Club. The yachtsmen are working away at nautical matters, i.e., as far as they can on terra firma; fortunately so, as they thus can be partially indifferent to Thursday's blizzard, which could scarcely be considered conducive to yachting. This evening's special general meeting at the Windsor Hotel has created considerable talk among the members and will be one of great interest and pleasure; a large attendance has, accordingly, been prepared for. After the voting, etc., on the various motions, as below, the presentation of last season's winnings will be made; and with a jolly and keen assemblage of tars, on the eve of the new year, as well as the annual ball, the merriment will last from the boatswain's pipe, "all hands on deck," to "Auld Lang Syne." There is much to be dwelt on regarding the prospective changes; suffice it to say, put a small crew on small craft, but have the full extent of the limit at general meetings, especially a club meeting at this happy season, and the following circular has been issued: "Dear Sir, You are earnestly requested to attend a special general meeting of the club, to be held at the Windsor Hotel, Saturday evening, the 29th of December, at 8 o'clock, at which the presentation of prizes will take place, reports of progress regarding the ball of the 7th of January will be submitted, and a vote be taken upon the following motions, of which notice has been duly given: "Moved, that junior members' annual subscription be left at $2, but the limit of age be raised to 21 years. Entrance fee to remain as it now is. "Moved, that yachts in the 18-foot class be governed by the same rule as the larger yachts in the matter of number of crew, viz., one man for every five feet, corrected length. "Moved, that yachts of the 18-foot class be restricted to jib and mainsail only. "Moved, that the annual subscription of the Royal St. Lawrence Yacht Club be $5 for all senior members elected prior to February 1st, 1895, and $10 for all senior members elected after that date, and that on February 1st, 1896, the annual subscription be raised to $10 for all senior members." L. H. McLintock acted as best man.

STORYTIME IN NEBRASKA Thousands of Farmers and Their Families Destitute. AGROPEVERITY THIRD YEAR. All the succor that has attended settlers' assistance recently has ceased to keep people alive. Omaha, December 28. Robert B. Beatty, staff correspondent of the World-Herald, has just returned from a two-week tour into southwestern Nebraska in order to investigate the reports of destitution in that portion of the state. In Keith, Perkins, Chase, Hayes, and Dundy counties, the destitution is extreme. Two-thirds of the people in these counties are dependent on charity for existence. There is no money in the County Treasurer's office to help the destitute because in many counties of the state no taxes have been collected since June. There is a scarcity of water. No crops were raised last year except in the occasional irrigated districts, and ditch irrigation is not possible in some of these counties because there are no streams. Most of the destitute live in sod houses. There have been only three crops raised in nine years. Heart-rending cases of destitution and suffering are heard of in every township. The present cold wave will certainly cause death to a large number of settlers if it continues, and no aid comes. Fuel, provisions, and clothing are needed, and the railways will generally ship them free if sent to the county commissioners at the county seats of the stricken counties. On Kir, Neb., December 28. The situation in Boyd County is bad, and if the people there are not helped soon, they will starve or freeze to death. Omaha, Neb., December 28. It is feared the blizzard of Wednesday and Thursday has caused great loss of life in the drought-stricken districts, as the people are without fuel. The temperature is from 10 to 15 degrees below zero.

FROM THE ANCIENT CAPITAL. Cardinal Toscheran will be unable to receive general visits on New Year's Day on account of illness, but will receive members of the clergy only on Monday. Lieutenant-Governor Chapleau returned from Montreal by yesterday's belated train, but on account of the blizzard could not proceed to Spencer Wood and, consequently, slept at the Union Club. It is regarded as somewhat remarkable in view of the fearful character of the storm that there is no loss of life reported in this vicinity. There is considerable speculation here as to the exact velocity of the wind yesterday. At the observatory, the instrument for recording it, which does so up to 80 miles an hour, was broken by the extreme velocity; the wind is, therefore, supposed to have attained to a hundred miles an hour from the force of a cyclone. The violence of the wind was so great that several of the boats in the Louise Basin were canted over on their sides, in which position they have since been firmly frozen in, and the roof of one of the ferry boats was blown off. The handsome bandstand erected in front of the Drill Hall during the late exhibition is a complete wreck. At Beauport, two houses, those of Napoleon Langevin and Geo Letouche, and the barns of Auare Marcoux, Jos Vallee, Ed Galarneau, and others were partly demolished. At Lorette, the roof of Mr. 

MONTREAL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1894.

The Dead Babe. Last night, as my dear babe lay dead, In agony I knelt and said: "O God! what have I done, Or in what wise offended Thee, That Thou shouldst take away from me My little son?" Upon the thousand useless lives, Upon the guilt that vaunting thrives, Thy wrath were better spent! Why shouldst Thou take my little son? Why shouldst Thou vent Thy wrath upon This innocent?" Last night, as my dear babe lay dead, Before mine eye the vision spread Of things that might have been: I licentious riot, cruel strife, Dark red with sin! Then, with soft music in the air, I saw another vision there: A Shepherd, in whose keep A little lamb, my little child, Cordially wisdom undented, Lay fast asleep! Last night, as my dear babe lay dead, In those two messages I read A wisdom manifest; And, though my arm be childless now, I am content, to Him I bow Who knoweth best. —Eugene Field.

PEOPLE were complaining last week that there would be no snow for Christmas and were evidently longing for it to come. And now as I sit at my window on Thursday writing these notes, I am wondering if those grumblers are satisfied. Winter has, indeed, come in earnest, and few of us who are not compelled to do so are venturing outside the shelter of our homes today. Our men folks go to their offices each day with unfailing regularity, and we feel very little pity for them in the endurance of their tedious routine of work. But, on a day like this, when they have to turn out in the morning into such a terrible blizzard, our warmest sympathies are enlisted. And then as each one of them comes in stamping and shaking himself, we can liken him to nothing but a regular Father Christmas, with all the necessary adjuncts, such as snow all over him and icicles on his moustache and beard. Poor things! These breadwinners are certainly not getting the best of it on a day like this! I saw a poor little boy carrying a large piece of glass along our street this morning. He was only about 10 years old, and the pane of glass was about half as big as himself, and valiantly he was battling against the snow and the wind, which seemed to come from north, south, east, and west at once. When I asked a friend who called which way the wind was coming, primarily, he said, he thought, "upwards." But is there not the proverbial silver lining to every cloud? And what of the hideous defects of a city that will be hidden by this pure white mantle when the wind shall have abated and we shall be able to look around in comfort? Even now, I can see from the back windows at each lull of the wind, how daintily the feathery covering is hiding the obnoxious dustbin in the yard, and smoothing over the rough unevenness of the neglected garden, giving to each a touch of beauty hitherto undreamt of. I am afraid that, at a first glance, my sketches this week will cause my friends to fancy that Christmas good cheer has so far infected my understanding as to make me mix up the seasons and fancy myself launched into summer weather; but, pray let me undeceive you! It is only that novelties are becoming difficult to find just now, and that, having had the opportunity of seeing the new blouses that one of our large Canadian manufacturers is preparing for next summer, I have taken the opportunity to make illustrations of some of them. Had I expected that such dreadful weather as this was coming upon us this week, I believe I would have deferred inserting these sketches for the present, or they seem so entirely inappropriate. However, as they are ready, they must be used, and I hope that my readers will accept them kindly, remembering that, in giving them now, I am at least doing my best to make my page of interest, and also to remind my friends that winter snows and winds will give place in time to the warmth of the spring sunshine, and that with the budding trees and warmer weather, cotton blouses will be welcomed as of yore. There is, unfortunately for the modistes, not any suggestion of a great deal of difference in the spring styles to those which we are getting accustomed to now. Skirts will be about the same size, stiffened considerably at the back, and sleeves promise to remain as large as ever. In the large sketch, I show two pretty waists of cotton, trimmed with lace insertion and a fine edging. The square sailor...

Collar gathered to the small round yoke is a novelty, as also is the round one. By the smaller sketches, it will be seen that lace will probably be as much used as ever, and that frills, if made of the same material as the blouse, will be more often finely pleated than ever. The tailor-made shirt, fastening over the blouse, will be de rigueur, as is evidenced by the make of the waists. I also notice that very few of the sleeves are made with a puff; they are nearly all of the very full leg of mutton style.

1894-12-31: A. Maguire, consul-general of the Argentine Republic at Quebec, and a lot of newspaper men from the West. Lord and Lady Aberdeen are guests of Lieutenant-Governor Daly. Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney and Mrs. Dewdney are guests of Judge Graham, and Lady Thompson and family of John Pugh. The Ontario and Quebec men say when they left the weather was very cold and a snow blizzard prevailed, and they were quite surprised to find in Halifax, Nova Scotia, there not only was no snow but the weather was very mild and pleasant. Gilbert Parker in Belleville, Ontario, December 29. Mr. Gilbert Parker, the famous novelist, arrived here this morning on a visit to his parents. Keep your blood pure and healthy and you will not have rheumatism. Hood's Sarsaparilla gives the blood vitality and richness. Try Southern Straight Cut Cigarettes 10 cts per package.

1895-01-03: Y, January 2. The body of James Carmen, who had been missing since the blizzard of Wednesday, has been found at the bottom of a snowbank near Antwerp. He was 72 years old. Thousands of cases of rheumatism have been cured by Hood's Sarsaparilla. This is abundant reason for belief that it will cure you. FROM THE ANCIENT CAPITAL. Interesting Items Gathered in and Around Quebec. From our own correspondent, January 2.

1895-01-04: V. Dodsworth, of the New York Journal of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin, attacking the present monetary system. He said that, as a rule, Government paper currency owes its existence to a degradation of public credit and its liquidation depends at best on the will or whim of a legislature. It is in turn the child and the parent of state bankruptcy. Mr. Dodsworth regarded the bank note as the fittest and best successor of these doomed currencies. Such a bank note he held to mean a note issued under conditions prescribed by the supreme authority of the nation, guaranteed by ample assets indefeasibly pledged for its final redemption, limited as to its volume by federal statutes, protected against undue expansion by a rigid economical and convenient system of current redemption, and watched as to its observance of legal requirements by a comptroller representing the national government. 

Fargo, the Capital of North Dakota, A Favorite Resort for those who have Found Marriage a Failure. The Tie Dissolved with Dispatch. "I will procure you a divorce for $50." That is the advertisement run by a local attorney, says a Fargo correspondent, whose clients form no small proportion of the Fargo divorce colony, a colony which has now gained precedent as the most extensive in number and superior in social standing of any in the United States. Previous to the last session of the legislature of the two Dakotas, although the North state had secured considerable reputation as a refuge for divorce-seekers, her fame was eclipsed by the sister state of the South, and Sioux Falls easily held the title of Divorce Mecca. But the last Legislature of the Pickerel state altered the case by extending the time of residence to six months. Abundantly able to realize the profits derived from this infant or anti-infant industry, the Pickerel colony refused to lengthen the time, and North Dakota has been rewarded by all the trade since then. The only requirement ordinarily necessary to secure legal separation in the Fargo courts is ninety days' residence in the state, depositions to satisfactorily prove the charges preferred, and a nominal attorney's fee, which competition has reduced to the minimum. Some astonishing figures can be shown in reference to the divorce industry. An estimate, made after a visit to many prominent lawyers of this city, places the total number of cases to be tried here during the next six months at upwards of fourscore and ten. But few of these seekers after single blessedness reside west of the Mississippi. The majority of them have journeyed hundreds of miles to this wrongfully yclept land of coyotes and blizzards to secure with little difficulty that which would necessitate much time and expense in the courts of their native states. Not that the courts of North Dakota do not balance the scales of justice as evenly as do those of other states; but the people of the effete East prefer to journey to the "frontier" to wash their dirty linen rather than obtain notoriety at home. New York City sends the largest contingent to the divorce colony; classic Boston is not far behind; the Windy City is well represented, and even St. Paul has a goodly representation. The colony is composed of all classes of humanity. The percentage of males and females is about equal; if there is much difference, the women are in the majority. Some of the pilgrims come from the highest society circles of eastern municipalities. Specially is this true of the New York and Boston contingents, nearly all of whom are people of wealth and prominence. Mingled with those of the upper ten are those in the lower walks of life—tradespeople and laborers of the common herd to whom the luxury of a divorce comes high, but must be had. Out of a gang of nine men recently engaged in repairing a sewer on the main street of Fargo, four were members of the divorce colony, compelled to work at anything while lingering here the required 90 days. In the stores, in the offices of professional men, in every branch of trade and business can these pilgrims be found. Having "served their time," the divorce seekers are subjected to little inconvenience. Last week a decree was secured in just 14 minutes. Often eight or 10 are ground out in a single day. In nine cases out of ten the respondent cares so little for the affections of his or her other half as to refrain from undergoing the expense of a pilgrimage to the Mecca of the movement or making a contest. Failure to appear means a speedy end to the case. The attorney who secured the decree in 14 minutes showed your correspondent a bundle of legal documents which proved to be applications to the number of 24 for divorce. Nine were from New York, four from Chicago, two from Boston, and the balance scattered over the broad expanse of Uncle Sam's domain. Only two were Fargo parties. The divorce business brings a large amount of money to Fargo annually, and is, therefore, regarded as an industry to be fostered and protected. Several ultra-fashionable boarding houses receive their patronage wholly from this source, and it is the most desirable trade the hostelries can capture. Members of the more wealthy class live in furnished residences, with retinues of servants and salaried companions. In one of the finest mansions of the city, there resides an old gray-haired man, who is living a hermit's life, which will end with the opening of the coming term of the District Court. He is a wealthy New Yorker, who, when three-score years had silvered his brow, married a girl of 10, whom he first saw at a vaudeville entertainment. But a few months of connubial bliss convinced him that his ballet dancer was not what she seemed to be when viewed from the bald-head row, and he came to Fargo. This gentleman has twice represented his district in the Legislature. His case is no more romantic than that of many fellow-sufferers who wend their way Dakota-ward. In one respect, Fargo is the loser by being the stamping ground of this motley throng: the morals of the city suffer sadly. While many of the pilgrims are quiet and orderly, paying their $50 and costs because they honestly deserve separation, many are adventurers and coquettes. It is more than mere assertion to say that many a Fargo home has been ruined by this class of divorce seekers; the instances are sad and numerous, furnishing subjects for current gossip in the city. It is to be expected, naturally, that the records of the divorce court contain some startling and sensational reading. In the main, it is the same old story in case after case: desertion and infidelity. The evidence in some is revolting in its tale of moral depravity. In others, it is extremely humorous, the allegations extremely ridiculous. One man's plea was that his wife's relatives were continually sponging upon him; another alleged that his wife was addicted to the use of tobacco, which was offensive in the extreme to him; another's plaint was that his better half drew his wages at the end of each week, and expended them with great prodigality; while one woebegone wretch, whose partner in life was a raw-boned amazon, claimed release from his partnership because his wife frequently belabored him with a rolling pin and other kitchen utensils, further alleging that at one time she held him down upon the floor and stuffed his mouth full of dough, considerable of which he was forced to swallow. In cases where the daughters of Eve are the plaintiffs, there are frequent charges of crimes no worse than the husband's kissing the hired girl or staying out late nights.

1895-01-05: S. Tamm, the cashier. Two men entered suddenly, drew revolvers, and ordered him to throw up his hands. He did. One of the robbers told him to go into the vault and followed him. The one who entered the vault kept the cashier covered while he gathered all the money in sight. Then he backed out, shut the door, and made the cashier a prisoner. The two men ran out, jumped into a buggy nearby, and escaped. 

A Bicycle Electric Road. Buffalo, January 4. During the past two weeks of heavy snows and minor blizzards, an experiment has been progressing at Waterloo of the bicycle kind on the electric railway. A storage battery car with not less than 20 passengers has been making frequent trips, accomplishing a speed of 12 to 20 miles an hour, and is said to be capable of running 200 miles without recharging the battery. The car weighs less than three tons with batteries and motors complete. It is expected that an elevated single track railway operated on this system will be at once constructed between Batavia and a point on the shore of Lake Ontario. 

Mayor Strong in an Investigating Mood. New York, January 4. "I am going to investigate every department of the city government from the top to the bottom. If there is any corruption, or if abuses exist anywhere, I propose to find it out," Mayor Strong made this announcement shortly after he reached his office this morning. Continuing, the Mayor said: "As soon as my commissioners of accounts are ready to go to work, I shall direct them to begin a thorough and systematic investigation of the departments. They have ample power under the law and I propose to see to it that the investigations are complete." 

Destitution at Buffalo. Buffalo, January 4. The poor master reports greater destitution this winter than last. The number of families who are receiving poor relief at this date is 2,311, as against 1,077 on the same date last year. There are, too, more applications for admission to the County Poor House than in any previous year. Of course, there is increased population, but the poor master says that the percentage of actual working men, who would do work if they could get any to do, who are applicants for relief, is greater than in any previous year. 

Killed in a Political Quarrel. HAMBURG, Ky., January 4. Sheriff John Van Arsdall shot and killed Dr. 

1895-01-10: "A LITTLE BLIZZARD." That Is What the Probabilities Have Scheduled for To-day.

1895-01-14: AN EXTRAORDINARY DROP The Temperature Falls From 10 to 60 Degrees in a Few Hours. Wheeling, W. Va., January 12. At noon today the thermometer stood at 60 above, a sudden change began, and by five o'clock it had dropped to 2 degrees below zero. Heavy snow fell during the afternoon. Princeton, W. Va., January 12. The fall in temperature today was 42 degrees in six and a half hours. Zero was recorded at 8 p.m., and at 10 o'clock tonight the mercury recorded 13 degrees below, with indications of a further drop. A driving snowstorm set in shortly after 3 o'clock. Cincinnati, January 12. Mercury registered nine degrees below zero here at 7 o'clock this morning. Reports from various parts of the state indicate extremely cold weather and heavy snowstorms prevailing. Bloomington, Ill., January 12. One of the most remarkable and sudden declines of the mercury occurred here yesterday, a change of 30 degrees being recorded. This morning at 6 o'clock the thermometer registered 10 degrees below zero. Augusta, Ga., January 13. Gay Harden, formerly station agent on the Georgia road, at Sawdust, was found this morning frozen to death. Buffalo, January 13. A snow blizzard began at four o'clock this morning and continued till late tonight. Trains are much delayed and travel in the city impeded. Reports of very cold weather and heavy snowfalls come from all quarters. The Astor Funeral. New York, January 12. The funeral of the late Mrs. William Waldorf Astor took place this forenoon from Trinity Chapel. The edifice was filled to the doors with the relatives and friends of the deceased. The coffin was of rosewood and was covered with wreaths and flowers sent by friends. On the top of the coffin was a solid silver cross, and on the plate was the inscription: "Mary Paul Astor, born July 4, 1868." With the exception of the husband, there was not a person of the name of Astor in the funeral party. After the service, Mr. Astor got into his carriage alone and followed the hearse to Trinity Cemetery, where the interment took place.

1895-01-26: K. Salter in the chair, when indignation was expressed at several citizens having, as they claimed, been thrown off the car. Mr. Clendinnen said he had had legal advice that if he was ordered off by the conductor to refuse, and if he was made to get off and take a cab to his destination, to fine the company for damages. He had also been advised that if the company did not run cars according to timetable, damages could be claimed. Mr. Ritchie complained that one of his boys had been thrown off the car, but this the inspector of the road and the conductor of the car both denied. Mayor Dunlop and Mr. James Ainslie had always found the conductor courteous and obliging, and if there was any blame it should be attached to the company and not to the conductor. A voice: "What right has the conductor to be here?" The conductor said he was present by invitation. Mayor Dunlop said that Mr. Corriveau, the manager, had also been invited. A voice: "He is afraid to come." "And if he did we would throw him out of the window," added another. Mr. Blacklock moved, seconded by Mr. Ramsay, that the council be instructed to take legal advice as to the reading of section 7 of the contract, which was carried. Several people present asked that there should be an early car reaching the city not later than seven o'clock in the morning, and a demand was also made that the company should be compelled to observe the agreement with regard to overcrowding. 

FATAL BOILER EXPLOSION. Five Lives Known to be Lost with a Probability of More. Mendota, Ill., January 25. A boiler explosion shook this city and the surrounding country for miles this afternoon. Five dead men and seven injured are the known casualties. The explosion was in the brewery of C. Henning & Sons. The entire structure was wrecked, and the work of searching for any more victims is hampered by the furious blizzard which is raging. There is also danger to the searchers from a big chimney, which is expected to fall any minute. The loss to the proprietors is $80,000. Until the wreckage is cleared away no one can tell how many lives were lost. 

OBITUARY, New York, January 25. James E. Gronias, president of the Tradesmen's National Bank of New York, died suddenly last night. Rome, January 25. Mgr. Carini, librarian of the Vatican, died suddenly today during services in St. Peter's. The Pope was greatly shocked by the news of his death. 

They Will Walk Back. Grand Rapids, Mich., January 25. The Orion quartette of this city have accepted a wager requiring them to go to San Francisco and back to this city, by way of New Orleans, visiting all the chief towns along the route. They must leave the city without a penny and with a ticket to the first station only, riding on passenger cars, relying solely on their voices to obtain funds. In order to win the bet they must bring back $3,000 in six months.

1895-02-05: HYMNALOGY DISCUSSED. Rev. Dr. Shaw's Discourse on the Hymns We Sing. The lecture given last evening by the Rev. Dr. Shaw on the "Hymns We Sing," in Dominion Square Methodist Church, under the auspices of the Women's Auxiliary of the Foreign Mission Society connected with it, was largely attended. Rev. Dr. Hunter acted as chairman, and in his remarks referred to the eloquent abilities of Principal Shaw. The lecturer, on arising, said he was there subject to the irresistible call of the ladies and to give some information regarding hymnology. His theme was not music but the hymn book. The Methodist hymn book was used by 3,600 churches in the Dominion and contained selections from all creeds and nationalities, and these dated back as far as the 3rd century, one written by Clement of Alexandria (No. 830). Many of the hymns now used were at one time refused and objected to. The book contained a single contribution by 119 authors, and strange to say these were much sought for and most used. The authorship of "What a Friend We Have in Jesus" and "Living Waters Freely Flow" was unknown. Continuing, he gave the following interesting statistics, which contained hymns by kings, poets, Gregory the Great, bishops, and numerous other dignitaries, from which may be seen how greatly indebted they were for many of their hymns, showing the number of hymns from each sect and the nationality of authors: 

No. of Hymns Countries, Authors 
Roman Catholics 24 
England 61 
Anglican 60 
United States 41 
Lutheran 10 
Germany 18 
Presbyterian 29 
Scotland 7 
Congregationalists 110 
Ireland 4 
Baptists 25 
France 4 
Moravians 28 
Canada 2 
Methodists 567 
Egypt 1 
Unitarians 18 
Asia Minor 2 
Universalists 2 
Italy 9 
Unknown 80 
Total 838 

The above authors include 143 men and 35 women, and range from the third to the nineteenth century, the former productive of one and the latter 107. He concluded by referring to the incarnation, which opened with singing by angels and closed by the singing of Christ and the Apostles, his earnest wish being that much salvation might be wrought through song. The Rev. Dr. Hose thanked the speaker in appropriate terms, as also the choir, who had so ably rendered so many selections in illustration of the lecture. 

Industries in the States, Chicago Tribune. About 18,000 Philadelphia carpet weavers have asked for a small advance in wages. The employers say that the state of their business will not permit them to pay more. A thousand men have just been thrown out of employment at the Joliet steel mills because it has been impossible thus far to settle on a scale of wages for this year. The company says that business is slack and it cannot afford to pay the wages the men say they are entitled to. In all the manufacturing centers, there is trouble about the wage scale. Employers are asking for reductions the men say they cannot stand, and the employees are asking for advances the employers say they cannot grant. 

A Missouri Blizzard. St. Louis, February 4. Reports received this morning from points throughout Missouri state that a blizzard is raging and the weather is bitter cold. Similar reports come from southern Iowa, eastern Kansas, and southern Illinois. 

PAYMENTS SATISFACTORY. Payments and Wholesale Houses. There is not the same importance attached to the fourth of February in financial circles as there is to the fourth of March, but it is, nevertheless, a date which is looked forward to as a kind of guide to what results may be expected from the later settling day. The Gazette yesterday afternoon interviewed a number of the leading banks and wholesale houses as to the outcome of the day as they had found it. 

1895-02-08: S. Bache & Co. of New York telegraph Messrs. Meredith & O'Brien as follows: "The market today was stagnant, trading being confined to the jobbers entirely, commission houses remaining inactive. The news of the day was meager until just at the close, when a private Washington dispatch announced as a fact that $75,000,000 bonds would be taken abroad, leaving but $23,000,000 here. If this is the case, it will certainly be accepted as a bull argument, especially if only $25,000,000 is left to be taken in this country, inasmuch as it will have but a slight effect upon the money market, whereas if fifty million dollars had been left it would undoubtedly have become stringent and may have interfered with the improvement anticipated. The bonds issued will be fours and will be issued on a 3 percent basis. Traders from now on will look towards railroad earnings to determine the situation, and these earnings are getting to show some improvement, and merchants generally are feeling more encouraged. After conversing with several merchants, a person feels like taking a better view of things in general, but after entering the stock exchange and listening to the blue ideas prevailing there, one is inclined to become a pronounced bear. In our opinion, however, it will not be long before brokers and commission houses will be all smiling at the renewal of activity and probable higher prices. The bears today tried to make some capital out of the blizzard west, arguing that it will cut into earnings severely. This is undoubtedly the case, but will be only a temporary embarrassment. The St. Paul earnings for the first week of February will show a very large decrease. New York Central for January shows a decrease of only $20,000, which is considered very favorable. The exchange market remains weak, and gold shipments are a thing of the past. The committee on reorganization of the Distillers Company has been appointed, and the names well received on the street. The business-like way and prompt action of these gentlemen have been very favorably commented upon, and every confidence is placed in them that they will put this company upon a sound financial business basis." MacDougall Bros., stock brokers, 69 St. Francois Xavier street, report the closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange today as follows: Stocks, American Cotton Oil, American Sugar Refining, Do, Pref, American Tobacco, J. P. Pref, Atchison, C. & O., Quincy. 

THE COLD SNAP is Sinking; It is Frigid in a Great Many Places. Chicago, February 7. The temperature is at zero. The wind is blowing at the rate of from 40 to 60 miles an hour, and the fall of fine, dry snow has stopped all the street railway lines and crippled the mail trains on every system running into the city. All sections of the country heard from so far report that the cold wave is holding on strongly, with little prospects of cessation. In Kansas and Nebraska, great suffering prevails on account of the severe blizzards which have been general over both states. Illinois and Indiana are in the grasp of snowstorms, and business is almost entirely suspended in some of the smaller towns and villages. The storm is due to an exceedingly high area which developed in the far northwest. Snow, accompanied by the northwest wind, came down the Missouri Valley with a rush. It is good for two days more at least. St. Louis, Mo., February 7. At nine o'clock this morning the quicksilver touched 7 below zero. A strong northwesterly gale is blowing, accompanied by flurries of fine hard snow. The indications are that the cold will increase and the worst blizzard for several years is anticipated. Extremely cold weather, accompanied by high winds and snow, is reported from points in southwest and western Missouri and in Indiana. Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, northern Texas, and southern Arkansas are suffering from a blizzard. The mercury dropped 40 degrees between noon and midnight yesterday.

ECHOES OF THE PRESS 

The boy's bright dreams are all before; The man's romance lies far behind. Had we the present and no more, Fate were unkind. But, brother, tolling in the night, Still count yourself not all unblest if in the East there gleams a light, Or in the West. 

Blackwood's Magazine 

Animating Motive in Froude's Writing: The first thing that must strike the mind of anyone who looks at Froude's writings as a whole is their amazing sameness of object, or, at all events, point of view. It is always the same nail he is hammering on the head. It reminds one of Pope's ruling passion. It crops up everywhere and at all times, firing his zeal wherever he is. What is that object? Why, to counteract what he calls "the Counter-Reformation," to denounce monkery; to unfrock priests by stripping them of all sacramental pretensions; to topple over everything standing between man and the force which called him into being; to preach good works and plain homespun morality. This was Froude's work from 1849 to 1894. If only he was about this business, he did not mind blundering about his facts; a misquotation or two never disturbed his night's rest. 

Augustine Birrell, in Scribner's 

The Indian Swell: A long-skirted tunic or frock of white muslin, close-fitting white trousers, and a tea-colored turban with a broad band of gold lace, and a tall, flashing plume of dark heron feathers and gold filigree were the salient points. Other accessories were the sword belt, crossing his breast and encircling his waist, of dark green velvet, richly worked with unalloyed gold, and thickly studded with emeralds, rubies, and brilliants; a transparent yellow shield of rhinoceros hide with knobs of black and gold enamel; a sash of stiff gold lace with a crimson thread running through the gold; bracelets of the dainty workmanship known as Jeypore enamel, thickly jeweled, which he wore on his wrists and arms; and there were strings of dull, uncut stones about his neck. The skirts of his tunic were plaited with many folds and stood stiffly out like the skirts of a premier danseuse in the ballet, and when he mounted his horse, a servant on either side held them so that they might not be crushed. Four valets had charge of this costume, and it took them some little time to array their master. The trappings of the horse were scarcely less elaborate; his neck was covered on one side with silver plates, and his mane, which hung on the other side, was braided and lengthened by black fringes relieved by silver ornaments. White yaks' tails hung from beneath the embroidered saddle cover on both sides, and his head, encased in a headstall of white enameled leather and silver, topped with tall aigrettes, was tied down by an embroidered scarf in order to give his neck the requisite curve. 

Harper's Magazine 

Fortified Paris: To-day, Paris, regarded as a fortified center, is an intrenched camp, upon the margin of which are numerous new permanent forts. The circle formed by the line of these new forts, which are far outside the forts of 1870, is about 85 miles in circumference, and it contains about 680 square miles, not more than one-seventh of that area being built over. It is a region nearly as large as Monmouthshire, with a population of 3,000,000. The smallest possible circuit to be formed around it by an investing army is 100 miles, so that at least 500,000 men actually upon the spot would be required to undertake any serious operations for the reduction by siege of the French capital. In practice, no fewer than 1,000,000 would be necessary. And fortified Paris, although so much more extensive than it was in 1870, can, nevertheless, be defensively held at present by 350,000 men, while, if 700,000, or even more, were called for, they could, without detriment to the field armies, be provided out of the 3,710,000 trained soldiers whom France now has at her disposal. 

The National Review 

A Good Builder: Mention was made in the early summertime of an oracle that one morning flitted into a half-grown apple tree, not 30 feet away from the window of a writer in the Hartford Journal, craned its little head this way and that, danced about on the limbs, and flitted away. Next day it returned with its mate, and the two began their work of building a home. A tiny branch pointing southeast and another pointing southwest were selected. Neither would hold the weight of the bird without bending. Before the day had passed, bits of thread were dangling from either limb, and thereafter the bird home took form rapidly. Thread after thread, raveling after raveling, hair after hair, followed each other into place, with as much precision and nicety as masons would use in adjusting pressed brick. After days of perseverance, the home was finished. It hung perhaps four inches below the limbs, the tiniest of threads reaching down to it from either limb. The slightest stir of air would sway it just enough to coo the young birds to sleep if they needed that sort of soothing. All through the long summer, the frail thing hung there. The family was reared after the manner of these handsomest of all nature's children; then the birds flew away, leaving the little structure to the mercy of the summer gales and showers. It withstood them all, and when a few weeks later the ice storm came, that for the moment paralyzed the whole country, filling the birdhouse to overflow with snow and ice, the tiny limbs bending almost to breaking under the weight, this bit of architecture still clung to the limbs, resuming its gentle swinging as soon as the ice gave way. Three days ago it was again overflowed with ice, the glistening drops freezing about it till, when the sun struck it, it looked a veritable ball of fire. When the wind shook off this last visitation of ice, the structure was still swinging gently, only here and there a stray bit of string and a disheveled look that indicated the struggle it had passed through. The little house is not only an interesting study, but is a source of continual wonder and marvel; all the more when one reads of the great weight of the ice that gathered upon it and its supports, as indicated by the measurements taken at Trinity College. 

A Quirky Halting Much Noise: A discussion is raging in Erie over a question propounded by a school teacher to her class: "If a tree located in a forest should fall and no one should see it, would it make a noise?" The question has created much discussion among the pupils to whom it was presented, and it has spread into other and wider circles. The debate turns upon the theory that sound exists only in the ear, and that there can be no sound where there is no ear to receive and respond to the atmospheric waves. 

Oil City Blizzard 

Treasures of the Polar Seas: In 1800, Count Komanzoff sent M. Ledentrom to explore the New Siberian islands, fitting him out at his own expense. Ledentrom reached La Roll's first island and was amazed at the prodigious stores of fossil ivory it contained; for although the ivory hunters had for forty years regularly carried away each year large quantities of ivory from the island, the supply of ivory in it appeared to be not in the least diminished. In about half a mile, Ledentrom saw ten tusks of elephants sticking up in the sand and gravel, and a large sandbank on the west coast of the island was always covered with elephants' tusks after a gale, leading him to hope that there was an endless amount of ivory under the seal. Ledentrom and Bannikoff went on to Kotelnoi and New Siberia, and they found the hills in the former island absolutely covered with the bones, tusks, and teeth of elephants, rhinoceroses, and buffaloes, which must have lived there in countless numbers, without the slightest vegetation. They also found that in New Siberia, the most eastern of the islands, the quantity of mammoth ivory was still more abundant, and in 1806, Bannikoff brought away 10,000 pounds of fossil ivory from New Siberia alone. 

Chambers' Journal 

The Decayed Music Teacher: The ordinary parent or guardian of a girl with a "turn for music" will very probably make his choice of a teacher from those to whom he listens with the greatest pleasure, forgetting that executive skill and the gift of imparting knowledge are more often found separate than together. The partially successful artist, then, is wont to fall back upon such teaching as he can get if he wants to make a livelihood out of his profession; and so enormous is the number of those who wish to take music lessons, if not to "go in for" music thoroughly, that the moderately efficient teachers have hitherto had small reason to despair of getting profitable pupils. These worthy people, however, will before long be singing a very different tune; in fact, something very like a repetition of the dirge performed by the respectable "gentlewomen" of the last generation, who, after taking to teaching music for a living on the strength of a dozen lessons taken when they were young and comfortably off, found their circle of pupils diminishing as the taste for music widened and deepened. For such as these, the increase in the number and the rise in efficiency of the regular schools of music has been their doom, for not merely in London, where the "decayed lady teacher" never flourished, but in every country town, the standard of taste has left them far behind, and nearly all such centers of their employment are now "worked" either by actual representatives of the great educational institutions of London, or their places are filled by younger artists, educated at such places as the Royal Academy of Music or the Royal College of Music, the principle of whose joint organization, in the matter of local examinations and the like, has been doing a most important work all over England during the short time of its existence. That inefficient teachers of art should have the bread taken out of their mouths is not a legitimate subject for regret, though hard cases could no doubt be cited, just as they can against such a work as that done by the organization of charity.

Color or Dogs: As to color, Xenophon shares our modern prejudice; he dislikes whole colored hounds, all black, all tan, all white, and prefers the colors mixed. With the shape aforesaid, good color, good nose, and plenty of tongue, you can make a good pack and hope to kill a hare. Breed your puppies in the spring, is his advice, and do not overfeed them; train them by taking them out in a leash to follow the old hounds on a line of scent; and if you have a spirited puppy, do not let him go away in view of a hare, or he will over-exert himself and do himself an injury. Would the reader like a list of Greek hound names? Xenophon will furnish him with a catalogue of forty-seven, most of which flow naturally into an English equivalent: Active, Bustler, Ravager, Reveler, Cheerful, and the like. "Give your hounds short names," he says, "that it may be easy to call them." Accordingly, the names which he leaves us are... Here is the corrected text:

without exception dissyllabic; for the Greek ear was not alive to the merits of the dactyl in sound nomenclature, and we look in vain for such a name as Aggelos. But we find, at all events, Hebe in his list; a name which, after 2,000 years, still does duty in our English kennels.

Pronunciation of Pepys' Name 

Some time ago there was a sort of Notes and Queries controversy on the subject of the pronunciation of the name Pepys. If I recollect aright, the point was undecided when the combatants dried their pens. In a footnote in the fifth volume of the new edition of the "Diary of Samuel Pepys," just issued by George Bell & Sons, there is an extract from some verses by one James Carcasse, a contemporary of Samuel's, who hated him like poison, which at least puts out of court one theory of the pronunciation. Exclaims virulent Mr. Carcasse: "Him I must praise who opened with my lips, Rent me from Navy to the Ark by Pepys." The late George Dawson's pronunciation was "Peps." If Mr. Carcasse rhymed with accuracy, "Bips" was the commonly accepted form.

The Tuscan Peasant 

In Tuscany, you will often find peasants whose families have been on the same farms for two or three hundred years. They talk of themselves as gents (the Roman gens) of the padrone (landlord), and take an affectionate interest in him and his family. But the Tuscan peasant is a thorough conservative; he has not yet grasped the changes brought about by railroads, steamboats, and international communication. He banks on a large extent of land on which to grow wheat enough to provide bread for the whole year, and is inclined to regard other crops as accessories. With the actual low price of corn, this does not suit the owner, particularly as in Tuscany it is customary to grow wheat two years running on the same land, with little or no manure. As soon as the corn is carried (early in July), the stubble is ploughed up and maize or millet is grown for early autumn cutting as green fodder. The yield of wheat is, of course, wretched, from six to thirteen fold, and enlightened proprietors who possess the requisite capital are dividing their larger farms and building the necessary farmhouses.

THE WORLD OF STAGE 

The week has revealed nothing new of importance to New York theatre-goers, but at the opera there have been great doings. Monday saw the finest first performance on this continent of Verdi's "Falstaff," one of the most remarkable musical productions of the century. Possibly no opera ever written occasioned such world-wide interest and comment as did "Falstaff" on its first production in Milan just about two years ago. From "Oberto" in 1839 to "Falstaff" in 1893 marks a career practically without parallel in the annals of music; a career of many successes and few failures, and one distinguished by a greater artistic and progressive development than that which has marked the career of any other composer, not even excepting Wagner. That Verdi, after having revolutionized his own art, personally speaking, astonished the whole world by the production of "Otello," should, at the age of eighty-four, have produced an important operatic work is remarkable enough; that he should have produced a work of such commanding musical merit and interest as "Falstaff" is little short of miraculous. For many years Verdi has been desirous of writing a comic opera, or at least one from a humorous standpoint, but had searched in vain for a libretto. But when in 1890 Boito suggested "Falstaff" to him as the subject for which he was in search, the composer became enthusiastic at once, set to work, and in two years and a half had completed the opera. The material for the story the librettist took from Shakespeare's "Merry Wives of Windsor" and "King Henry IV," but for operatic purposes the story was condensed and reduced to three acts and five scenes. The characters, too, were sifted down to ten, as follows: Sir John Falstaff, Bardolph, Pistol, Ford and his Wife and their daughter Nanette (under which title Anne Page of Shakespeare's immortal comedy masquerades), Mistress Page, Dr. Caius, Mrs. Quickly, and Fenton. The opera has no overture. The curtain rises after the fourth bar and the voice begins at the eighth. 

Monday night's performance at the Metropolitan was a most excellent one for a "premiere." The central figure was, of course, Victor Maurel, and a most lifelike, sympathetic impersonation of the fat knight he gave. The reading and composition of the role, making all due allowance for the heightened hues of the operatic ideal, were wonderful. No actor on the theatrical stage today can vie with Maurel in the part. Unctuous in action, if not in voice, fidelity as to dress and action, Maurel's Falstaff is worthy to rank as a humorous pendant to his subtle Jago. He was in good voice and acted with great spirit, humor, and unfailing intelligence. He had to twice sing the charming measures in the second act, "Quando ero paggio del Duca di Norfolk." In a word, his creation of Falstaff is a masterpiece. Emma Karnes, the Mistress Ford, was the only woman who had any idea of costuming and of her environment. She looked early-English, and very lovely, and she sang with brilliancy. Campanari, the artist that he always is, was Ford, and sang nobly. Scalchi was not very convincing as Dame Quickly, Miss Itano was a sweet Teuton, and Zalie de Lussan a colorless Anne. Jane de Vigue was Mistress Page. There was no Master Page and no Blunder in the libretto, but our old friends, Bardolph, Pistol, and Dr. Caius were in evidence. The opera scored a triumph, and it bids fair to be a second "Carmen" success. Certainly, it is the most significant apparition in the world of opera since "Otello." 

As for the orchestration, says a New York critic, it is simply a never-ending charm, with delicacy of handling, such color-sense, such tact and characterization! The first act is broadly humorous; the second has a tragic note, and the third is suffused with a poetic glow, and in all is the salt of life—humor, kindly humor, is a reproach to the younger generation of driveling pessimistic composers of today. Mancinelli conducted, and came in for his share of flowers and bravos. Besides, it was his birthday, and his stand was ornamented with flowers, and he got a fanfare when he took up his baton. It was a great night for Verdi, for Maurel, and Mancinelli. 

"Samson et Dalila," which was given its initial performance at the Metropolitan on Friday evening, is one of the earliest of Camille Saint-Saëns' larger compositions. He was still organist of the Madeleine when it was written, in 1877, and received its first performance in the drawing-room of Madame Pauline Viardot, in Paris, where many a famous work has been heard. Some three years later Weimar saw it in 1877; it was produced at Rouen in 1890, and a couple of years later it was added to the repertoire at the Paris Opera. The libretto is the work of M. Lemaire, a cousin of the composer, and differs in many essential particulars from the Biblical story. Dalila is a priestess of Dagon, and when she witnesses the slaying of Abimelech, and the revolt of the Israelites, headed by Samson, she resolves to encompass the leader's ruin. In the second act, Samson is before the house of the temptress, in the valley of Horek, and falls a victim to her wiles, the Philistines stealing upon the helpless giant as the curtain falls. In the last act, Samson is led into the temple and tears down the pillars, burying himself under the ruins with his jeering enemies. The two principal characters are played by Mme. Mantelli and Signor Tainagno. Signor Campanari appears as the High Priest, M. Plancon as Abimelech, and the other roles are played by Signori Kinaldini, Vanni, and de Vacchetti. 

"Tristan and Isolde" will open the season of German opera in the Metropolitan on the 25th inst., with Frau Rose as Isolde, Frl. Marie as Brangäne, Herr Franz Schwarz as Kurwenal, Herr Paul Lange as the Seaman, Herr Rudolph Oberhauser as Melot, Herr Emil Fischer as King Marke, and Herr Max Aivary as Tristan. "Siegfried," with Herr Aivary in the title role, will be given the same week by Frau Schuber, Miss Marcella Lindh, and Herr Lange, Schwarz, Behrens, and Oberhauser. "Lohengrin" will introduce Frl. Godski as Elsa, and Herr Nicholaus Bothmühl as Lohengrin; the Ortrud being Frl. Brema, Herr Franz Schwarz appearing as Telramund and Herr Oberhauser as the Herald. The performance will be under the direction of Mr. Walter Damrosch. 

Tony Pastor says: "When Lillian Russell came to me she was a slender, awkward girl of sixteen, but her face was a picture. It was a girlish beauty that has developed with womanhood into the glorious beauty that has made her famous. That night was an awful trial for her. She didn't know what to do with her hands. Frank Gerard, once a cannon-ball tosser, was the stage manager of my theatre then. He told me that he gave Lillian her first instructions: 'Just clasp your hands behind your back and leave them there while singing.' Her first song was a simple little thing; to see her second and her third, but she sang them all with such exquisite sweetness that even her audience of sporting men and men about town, not always bad critics either, was generously enthusiastic." 

"Robber Roy," a new burlesque, was produced at the Imperial Music Hall, New York, on Monday. The piece is in three acts. The first scene is laid among the Highlands of Scotland where Rob Roy McGregor and his clan are gathered. A message comes offering them all places on the New York police force. Of course, they accept, and in the next scene, which shows the exterior of the Manhattan Athletic Club, they appear in their new uniforms as members of the "finest." In the last act, the interior of the club is shown while a vaudeville performance is in progress. A raid by the new police force brings the whole to a close. There are numerous local hits, and the new burlesque promises to have a long and successful run. 

A new melodrama "Humanity," by W. H. E. Ibe Monil Wan. 

Evidently an International Affair. 

New York, February 8. The blizzard has effectively blockaded navigation in the harbor. Ferryboats are running under great difficulties. The boat plying between this city and Liberty Island is not running on account of the heavy ice in the harbor. Off Liberty Island, the British ship Frankenstein, ready to sail for Shanghai, is caught in the ice and dragging her anchor toward Brooklyn. A tug has gone to her assistance. The British steamer Greenlands, lying at the Commercial Wharf, Brooklyn, which was to have sailed at 5 o'clock this morning for Gibara, Cuba, is frozen fast in the ice, and will scarcely be able to get out today. Erie Basin is completely tied up. Travel on the suburban railroads is greatly impeded by the storm. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western road is reported completely blocked. The Jersey Central got four through trains into the city at 10 o'clock, but only one went out before that hour. The freight traffic on this road was frozen up early last night, and the side tracks are lined with coal and freight cars. The fishing schooner Emma was driven ashore near Swinburne Island last night and became a wreck. The captain and four seamen reached shore in a small boat, after terrible suffering. Four men took to the other boat and are missing. According to E. B. Dunn, weather prophet, today's storm is worse than the famous blizzard of March 12-15, 1888, in several ways—in wind, temperature, and the area affected. Only in snowfall was the storm of 1888 greater than in today's. Mercury will probably go 10 below zero tomorrow morning. At 2:00 o'clock this afternoon, there were seventeen crafts stalled in the harbor. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

Ice in the vicinity of the Battery. The N.Y., February 8. Snow about a foot deep on the level fell last night. The wind was violent and the snow drifted. At ten o'clock this forenoon, no train had reached here from New York on either the Hudson River or West Shore roads. Lockport, N.Y., February 8. The worst blizzard within the memory of the present generation is raging here. No trains have reached here from any direction this morning, and business is nearly suspended. Newport, H.J. 8 Cache & Co., of New York, Telegraph Meters Meredith & O'Brien as follows: "The feature of today's market is the issue of the bond call, the facts being revealed in a message to Congress from the President. Prior to this announcement, the market had been very heavy as the Administration bill had suffered a very heavy defeat yesterday in the House. At first, traders were somewhat bewildered as a number of rumors were in circulation, but the facts in the case are that the President sells $62,317,600 of thirty-year 4 percent bonds, for which the Treasury is to get three and a half million ounces of gold, which will bring the reserve in the Treasury up to a little above the $100,000,000 mark. The syndicate formed will get half of this gold from Europe, while the other half will be supplied from this side. The rate at which the bonds were sold to the syndicate, 5½ percent, was a surprise, it being a higher price than had been anticipated, and the general list broke quite badly, closing with but a small rally. Some of the foregoing details may not be correct in every particular, but the facts are that Mr. Cleveland has shown his determination to take care of the Treasury's finances. The news, however, that the Government is compelled to sell bonds on a 3 percent basis is nothing to boast about. In former years, it has been the proud boast of this country that its credit was ahead of all other countries, judging from the price of its bonds. This has now all been changed, and when the people realize the situation, they will very readily see the cause of this, which is that our legislators have been content to play cheap politics rather than take care of the country's needs, and that the country at large has been made to suffer; the syndicate price, namely 3½ percent, will open the eyes of the taxpayers to this fact, and it will, in our opinion, lead to a better realization of the situation and avert another and severer object lesson. We think the market will be lower as the money market will harden from this on, and the bank statement will show about $5,000,000 decrease, and when the money for the bond issue has been paid into the Treasury, the reserve will show another large shrinkage. The money market has been so easy for years that a tightening of rates will no doubt influence prices. Regarding earnings, some may be temporarily interfered with by the blizzard in the West, and we expect the St. Paul earnings for the second week to show a big decrease; still, people must not forget that this is not the time to be bearish as conditions in the mercantile world are not on the mend. 

MacDongall Bros., stock brokers, 69 St. Francois Xavier street, report the closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange today as follows: Stocks, American Cotton Oil, American Sugar Refining Co. pref, American Tobacco 110, pref, Atchison, C.I. & A., Keynote National. The first number of this new monthly shows that Captain Chartrand has at last deserved success. The Lieutenant-Governor, Mr. Laurier, Mr. Mantel, Mr. Marchand, Mr. Beausoleil, Mr. David, and Mr. Perrault wish the new venture success and adorn its pages with their photographs. Mr. Joseph Royal contributes a pleasantly written domestic sketch, "Les Amours d'un Notaire," and Mr. Louis Frechette a charming little poem, "À Ma Petite Louise." Dr. Hinstone discusses the influence of the Canadian climate in an interesting paper, and Mr. Dansereau writes learnedly on the mechanism of the eye. Mr. Benjamin Bulte has a historical study, "Fort Frontenac, 1673-84." Mr. Jos Marmette begins a serial story, Mr. John Hague deals with finances, Mr. Ch. des Carres with foreign affairs, while the ladies' corner is under the care of "Françoise." It will be seen that Captain Chartrand has secured the services of some of the ablest of our French-Canadian writers, and their work is presented in very pleasing style, paper and print being all that could be desired. 

The Grand Trunk Coal Tenders. The coal men still continue in town. What with the blizzardy state of the weather and the uncertain train communication, and the still greater uncertainty as to who of the mighty host of gems and owners have been successful in securing the big contracts, the great majority determined last night to remain in Montreal another night. Another ten hours will decide the question, but already rumors as to the successful ones are flying thick and fast. The disappointed ones are taking revenge for their loss of time and trouble by spreading broadcast statements of terms, quantities, etc., altogether impossible. Some of them, while condoling with each other in the expectation of defeat, are so palpably on the tenterhooks of uncertainty as to be positively amusing. 

Mr. H. Bartolo, Mr. Allan Macduff, Mrs. Wallace, and Misses B. Dyer, L. Potter, Anna Miles, and F. da Fontoura. St. John the Evangelist's Dean Norman's many friends in the local area will be glad to learn that they will shortly have an opportunity of again hearing him lecture. He has kindly consented to speak on Shakespeare's play "Julius Caesar," in the Church of St. John the Evangelist's Parish hall, Ontario street, on Tuesday evening next at eight o'clock. The Dean is a devoted Shakespearean scholar, and that he will treat the subject in an interesting manner goes without saying. 

The Opening Postponed. The president and directors of the United Counties Railway Company had issued invitations to a large number of friends to attend the formal opening of the road today, leaving the Bonaventure depot at nine o'clock and returning to the city by seven. In consequence of the severe storm, however, the inauguration has been postponed until a future date. 

Ancient Order of Foresters. There was a good attendance at Court Unity last night. After business, a program was gone through very creditably. Pro Wheble, of Court Reliance, contributed to the evening's enjoyment by singing several songs. Bros. Silverwood, Scruton, Davidson, Green, and McDowell, of Court Unity, also took part. It is intended to visit Court Reliance on Tuesday next. 

Found in Time. An old man was found asleep in a pile of snow at the corner of Craig and Gosford Streets last evening. He was half frozen and was taken to the Central Police Station where he was cared for. His hands were bare, and it was all he could do to hold the snow shovel he had been using. He had a cloth cap on and a short jacket but no overcoat. 

Death of Mrs. Owen Drury. The death occurred last evening at 41 St. Alexander street, of Mrs. Owen Drury. The deceased lady was a sister of Messrs. Bernard, Denis, and Owen Tansey, and mother of Mrs. James Drury, of the Gazette newsroom. She had been ill for some time. Mrs. Drury possessed a large circle of friends, to whom her death will be a great grief. 

The Snow and the Railroad. The snowstorm and blizzard played havoc with the service on the Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific yesterday; all the trains due in the city in the morning got in all the way from two hours to eight hours late, and some of the outgoing trains left on time. On the Grand Trunk, many of the local trains were cancelled. 

Mr. Floquin, Sr., Dead. Another of the men of 1837 has passed away in the person of Charles Pelquin, who died yesterday at Sault-au-Récollet at the age of 73 years. Deceased, who did business formerly at St. Jude's, was the father of fifteen children, one of them being Mr. 

THE CRIMINAL COURTS. 

Lanieri Paid to Appear in an Enquete. Paid $21 for a Kiss. "They were not present; that was the only trouble," remarked Judge Dugas yesterday afternoon in the Police court, when he gave a roasting to the lawyers who had cases in enquete for not being there when the cases were called, and as the judge said, it was a shame, in such a storm, to bring out witnesses and put them to such inconvenience. In the morning, there were two prisoners before the court, which took up all its attention. These were Stanislas Veroneau and Philippe Léveque. These gentlemen of leisure had been arrested by High Constable Bissonnette for stealing sheep, but when the case came up, it came out that there were four cases, and the result was a long investigation. It came out that they had been living on the farmers in the vicinity of their residence, and that when they wanted meat, they simply went to a barn and stole the first sheep they could find and then proceeded to cut its throat and skin the carcass. The court said that this was a most flagrant case and sentenced the first named to twenty-three months in jail and the other to twelve months. Twenty-five dollars is a high price to pay for a kiss, but this is what Casimir Dault had to pay yesterday in the Recorder's court for one. The party who was the means of his doing this was Madeline Favard, who swore that while she was employed as a domestic in the Winnipeg house, on Windsor street, the accused kissed her by force. 

THE WAY OF THE BLIZZARD. Yesterday's blizzard was the worst of the season for many years, and fortunes were lost. Those who could not venture out remained indoors during the evening and enjoyed the comfort of smoking Hirsch's Perique Mixture. Headquarters for the same, Hirsch's Havana Cigar depot, opposite the 2nd and 3rd division of the same road. 

Exeter, Ont., February 8. A regular northwest blizzard has been raging here all day with unabated fury, with the temperature about 3 below zero. The roads will be badly blocked up by morning. The trains on the L.R. train, which left here this morning, had to return, being unable to get through the drifts on the Queenston mountain. The trail stage from Niagara Falls managed to get through, though several hours late. The temperature is still below zero. 

Barbie, Ont., February 8. The thermometer is 10 below zero, and it is snowing and blowing a terrific gale. The roads are blocked up fast, railway traffic greatly impeded, and many cases of frozen faces have been reported. 

Montreal, Ont., February 8. Special. An ice bridge has formed at Baker's Point, just east of Farran's Point. Floating ice has filled the river as far west as Aultsville and is still filling in. The water has risen here nearly two feet in twenty-four hours and is still rising. Unless something is done at once to remove the bridge, serious damage may result in this town and vicinity. 

Lindsay, Ont., February 8. There was a light fall of snow during last night, which, with a high northwest wind, has turned into a real blizzard. All trains are very late, with every prospect of their being entirely snowed and drifted up. Business is at a standstill, very few people venturing out. The thermometer is below zero and the storm is increasing. 

Hawkesbury, Ont., February 8. Severe snowstorm; fall continues; about nine inches of snow has fallen; roads blocked. 

Hunt's Falls, Ont., February 8. This is the worst storm of the season. About eight inches of snow has fallen, and it is still snowing heavily and drifting very badly. The roads are impassable, and all trains are many hours late. 

Cornwall, Ont., February 8. A heavy gale has been blowing here from the north and east since last night. The thermometer registered 20 below zero. Trains are from one to two hours late. 

Peterborough, Ont., February 8. A blinding snowstorm set in here early this morning, accompanied by very high north and northwest winds. Travel through the country is almost entirely suspended, and all trains are from two to five hours late. 

Napanee, Ont., February 8. A severe storm set in about 10 o'clock last night and still continues. The mixed trains are cancelled, and all express trains are late. 

Port Hope, Ont., February 8. The storm of last night was one of the most severe of the season. Trains on the C.K. are from one to two hours late. The Brockville and Westport Train, however, arrived only a few minutes late.

**Mes hue Lom on, Ont, February 8**  
The worst storm in for many years is now raging here. Business is completely at a standstill. The Humane Society officers are looking sharply after the streetcar horses, and they have stopped all but the cars on Lunulas and Richmond streets, and have sent a large number of horses to the stables. Reports from various places in this section show that the storm is very severe.

**IN OLEHKR PROVINCE**  
The storm was fully as severe as it was in Ontario.

**QiiiLC, February 8 (Special)**  
The storm today was one of the worst of the season, the wind having attained a velocity of 60 miles an hour, and huge snow drifts are piled up on the streets. Tonight, after the east wind went down somewhat, it veered about and commenced storming from the west. There were specially high tides tonight, and the effect of the strong east winds has blown up the water of the river to such an extent that the lower parts of the city were all inundated. In St. Roch's, the water was two or three feet deep on Prince Edward Street, and cellars as far back from St. Charles as Deslosses Street were flooded. In Lower Town, D'Aubigny Street and the stores about Finley Market were flooded, and considerable damage was done in the flour store. It is expected that in many cases the loss will be heavy. All the trains today were late.

**M. Tin cotte & Co**  
The water stood four feet in the basement of Messrs. Thibaudeau Frere & Co, but this firm was not to be caught napping and had removed everything of value to safe places, leaving only a few empty packing cases for the flood. A funeral was blockaded on the little river road in the afternoon. The hearse got jammed in a snowbank. The horses were unharnessed and placed in a stable close by, and the hearse passed the night in the snowbank. An old man, named Bussiere, a milkman from Little River, was found almost frozen to death under his horse near Lorett. The old man is 70 years of age. His horse was blinded by the blizzard and unable to proceed on its way. The animal broke away from the sleigh, but had only proceeded a short distance when it became stuck hard and fast in a snowbank. Bussiere reached the horse and sheltered himself under it. When found, the unfortunate old man was in an almost dying condition. He will probably die. At Hedleyville and at Levis, the water was several feet deep. An ice bridge formed here in the river opposite the city today but went down with the ice this evening, and it may jam again when it ascends with the turn of the tide.

**Montreal, Ont, February 10**  
The situation of the ice bridge remains unchanged. At this writing, floating ice and snow has blocked the river as far west as Weaver's Point, three miles above Ants-ville, and is still filling in. The water here has risen about a foot in the last twenty-four hours. Considerable indignation is expressed at the Government for not taking steps earlier in having the bridge cut out when it was first seen; it being too late now. A flood seems inevitable. Parties in this vicinity are removing rowboats, etc., which shows a flood is expected. As this bridge is swung every season, it is high time the Government take some action to prevent its swinging, or when swung to cut it out immediately, and thus save a lot of trouble and damage to property which always follows.

**Across the Lines**  
**Philadelphia, February 10**  
The snow blockade on the Pennsylvania and Reading railways was practically raised today. Trains on the main lines of both roads are running, but a little behind time. On the Reading, the first through train from New York since Thursday afternoon reached here at 9 o'clock this evening by a roundabout way. The branches of both roads are still badly snowed under, and a number of trains are stalled in various parts, and their passengers are being cared for in farmhouses along the lines. The most serious situation is on the Delaware railroad in Delaware. Four passenger trains are walled in by big drifts at different points along the road, and they may not be reached by relief trains before tomorrow morning. These trains have been snowed in since Friday, and the passengers must have suffered greatly from cold and exposure. On all the branch lines of the Delaware road, not a wheel is turning, and all small towns are cut off from obtaining their usual supplies.

**New York, February 10**  
The aftereffects of the big storm on the railroads running into Jersey City were slowly dissipating themselves today, but there was still some trouble. The Pennsylvania road tonight announced the resumption of its train service to all points except on a few of its unimportant branches. The Lackawanna is clear to Buffalo. At the Grand Central station, the New York Central reported that there had been a fresh storm on the Buffalo and Mohawk divisions. The road was quickly assuming its normal conditions, but there was more or less delay in all directions.

**On the Other Side**  
**Dublin, February 10**  
An unprecedented snowstorm has blocked traffic throughout the south of Ireland today. The American mail, which left Dublin this morning, has been unable to get beyond Charleville. The Cork trains for Dublin are fast in the snow near Banteer, fifteen miles from here. The snow falls so rapidly as to prevent clearing the tracks.

**London, February 10**  
The extreme cold throughout the United Kingdom still prevails. Isolated cases of skaters drowning were reported today, and many churches caught fire this morning from overheated flues, but none were destroyed.

The Teutonic, from Queenstown, January 31, with 212 cabin and 199 steerage passengers, came up to quarantine this morning. The Teutonic arrived at the bar at 7:04 p.m. last night and was detained outside 25 hours, owing to a heavy snowstorm and blizzard. Time of passage: 7 days, 11 hours, and 1 minute. Day's runs: 477, 481, 478, 488, 330, 228, 240, and 136 to Sandy Hook. Distance: 2,804 knots. The Teutonic was within three miles of Sandy Hook at 5:38 p.m. Thursday, but owing to a hurricane from the east.

**H, 12 Banning on Scheduled Time**  
The electric cars for Outremont were seen standing at their usual waiting post at the foot of Bleury Street on Sunday in spite of the terrific storms of last week. Prof. Carus-Wilson, with another gentleman of McGill, went on the plough and sweeper with Messrs. Corriveau and Mar-pie on Saturday afternoon, experiencing the hard battle the Park and Island Railway Company was having in fighting the blizzard and ploughing through the snowbanks of from 9 to 10 feet on the Outremont division. On account of the hard-packed snow in Mile End, the Back River line did not get on schedule time before Sunday night; but, although the drifts lay from eight to twelve feet deep in many places, and the wind drifted the snow across the rails almost as fast as the ploughs and sweepers could clear it out, the cars have been well on time ever since. The company received many congratulatory messages for the manner in which it had mastered the heavy storm.

**A Scare Firing Through the Air**  
There was quite a lively time on Saturday night at a certain fashionable boarding house on University Street. One of the boarders became suddenly excited and, seizing a couple of razors, attacked a fellow boarder named Mr. Vesy U. Wigmore. The latter was in bed and took a flying leap to get out of the way, and with great dexterity struck the razors out of the other's hand. The attacking party then retreated to his room, but almost immediately returned with a revolver, swearing that he would have Mr. Wigmore's heart's blood. The latter, thinking discretion the necessary virtue just then, skipped into the street in only his shirt and a short jacket, preferring the cruel blasts of Boreas to being bored by a pistol ball. Finally, the revolver was taken away from the sanguinary boarder, and his friends are watching to see that he does not break out again in a fresh place.

**18950218:**  
K. Woodward asked his opinion on the subject of cutting dogs' ears and tails, a practice which the Prince of Wales has recently condemned very strongly. Dr. Mills said that his opinion on the subject was very decided. A mutilation of nature's handiwork rarely effected any improvement. It was a cruel practice to cut dogs' ears, and generally it was not done properly, and the dog's appearance was spoiled. If their tails were cut when they were very young, it did not hurt them much when done properly.

**The Jacques Cartier Ice Track**  
Not discouraged by the great blizzard which prevented the race meeting of two weeks ago from being carried out, the proprietors of the Jacques Cartier Ice Track announce an attractive program for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of this week, when $1,000 will be offered in purses. It is expected that quite a number of the horses which competed at the Hamilton meeting last week will come down for these races, and with others expected from Ottawa and the Townships, three days of excellent sport are assured. The program in detail is as follows:  
**FIRST DAY**  
**RACE 1**: 2:45 class  
**RACE 2**: 2:27 class  
**RACE 3**: 1:50  

**SECOND DAY**

The fourth and last day of the Hamilton Jockey Club's trotting races opened with beautiful weather and a magnificent track. The ice was flooded again last night and was smooth as glass. The attendance was only fair. The 2:25 unfinished race of yesterday was won by Grimsby Girl, Nettie Y second, and Hamlet third; time, 2:14. 

**SKOLH Winter in England**  
London, February 21. The continued cold weather in Great Britain is having a most serious effect in all parts of the country. Aside from the suffering involved, the low temperature has caused a practical standstill of all horse training and hunting during the last six weeks. A number of important race meetings, including the big military steeplechase at Sandown Park, fixed for yesterday, and the Manchester February meeting, have been entirely abandoned. One distressing feature of the situation is that fully two-thirds of the houses in London are entirely without their usual water supply, in consequence of the freezing of the water. An extraordinary scene was witnessed on Wednesday last in front of the Mansion House, the official residence of the Lord Mayor, in connection with the intensely cold weather. A large number of people gathered there in consequence of the circulation of a false report that the Lord Mayor had issued a proclamation warning the citizens of London of the near approach of an enormous blizzard, which would impede all traffic and cause cessation of business. It was also reported that the proclamation urged the people to provide themselves with a full stock of provisions for three days in order to be prepared for any emergency, and also warned all citizens to be within the doors of their residences before midnight on Thursday in order to escape being overtaken by the elements. Skaters, however, in England have never had such an excellent opportunity for indulging in sport on the ice, and the lakes and ponds, all of which are frozen over, are crowded day and night. The interests of society are centered in the daily skating parties which have been held on the lake in Buckingham Palace gardens, at which the Prince of Wales and his daughters, the Princesses Victoria and Maud, the Duke and Duchess of York, Princess Henry of Battenberg, who is a beautiful skater; Lord Marcus Beresford, Sir Francis Edmund George Astley-Corbett, son of the Prince of Wales' friend the late Sir John Dugdale Astley, a noted patron of sports, and numbers of other prominent persons, were in daily attendance. Hockey matches on the ice, beginning at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and lasting until 5 o'clock, when tea and other hot drinks were served, have been the features of these parties. The most notable match was played on Thursday afternoon between teams captained by the Prince of Wales and Mr. Francis Midmay.

**CALIFORNIA ORANGES**  
There is much interest in green fruit circles concerning the condition of California oranges in view of the damage to oranges by the blizzard which swept across the Florida peninsula Christmas week; also the damage to the crop in Valencia, Spain, and the subsequent reduction of the crop of oranges in Aderno and Sicily by hailstorms. The orange dealers in this city are anxious to obtain some definite information regarding the orange crop and weather in California. A prominent California shipper was conversed with on the subject yesterday at the Fifth Avenue hotel. He said in reply to questions: "During the early part of last month the weather in Los Angeles and surrounding sections was moderately cool. Frosts in the latter part of last month were frequent, and very naturally have caused some fear among the growers of oranges and lemons. Up to date, however, no damage has been sustained, except to some of the most delicate vegetables in exposed places. At this time interest is pretty much centered in the better prospects for marketing the oranges. The recent despatches announcing the destruction of the Spanish crop of Valencia by frost have created a feeling among the exchanges in California that with the Florida disaster it will give them a grand opportunity for making a wider distribution of their fruit. It is also claimed, through these misfortunes of their competitors, that they intend to hold to high prices. From what I learned of the situation when in Los Angeles, it may be inferred that some of the growers are laboring under misapprehension respecting the competition of foreign crops with their own relative to prices. It has been announced authoritatively that the Southern Fruit Exchange of Los Angeles have fixed their prices and intend to stay right with them. They are not sufficiently high to give the growers a good profit, which they are deserving of. The step taken to maintain high prices has occasioned numerous complaints from the East, the dealers intimating that they will handle foreign oranges. Nearly or in fact all the packing houses are busy, and the fruit is moving well to a good market. Riverside, Highlands, Colton, Pomona, and Redlands are marketing their oranges with excellent results. California will be a leading spirit in filling the gap caused by the recent freeze in Florida, with the assistance of the Mediterranean fruits.

**DROWNING ACCIDENT**  
I happened to be left here to attend a dance at Charles Shipman’s in one of D. Lloyd's livery rigs and a very valuable horse, and drove into open water. As soon as the men found they were in the water they jumped, but the ice wouldn’t hold them. Their cries attracted the farmers along the river, who got them out terribly exhausted. The horse and cutter are at the bottom of the river in 70 feet of water. 

**SOUTHERN SNOWSTORM EXTENDS**  
From the Mississippi to the Atlantic. St. Louis, March 20. A snowstorm in this vicinity has been raging during the past 24 hours. Reports from Southern Missouri and Illinois show that the storm has been severe in these sections. Railway traffic is greatly impeded. The storm is still raging and is the most severe in years. The snow is six inches deep and is drifting. At Percy, Ills., a steady northwest gale with blinding snow and minute particles of ice is blowing at the rate of 42 miles an hour. The snow has drifted three and four feet deep in places. 

**Demi-ov, Tex., March 20**  
A terrific sandstorm, filling the air with sand, swept over this section last night. Houses were unroofed, trees blown down, and a great deal of damage done. It was the most violent windstorm ever experienced in this section. It is not known that any lives were lost. 

**Roanoke, Va., March 20**  
Roanoke was given another touch of winter today. A blizzard raged during the forenoon, and snow continued to fall all the afternoon and evening. Trains were delayed. 

**Charles, Va., March 20**  
About five inches of snow fell on the peninsula today.

**THE SUMMER CYCLISTS**  
Good Shooter at the Traps Racing in the States. Miscellaneous Sporting. The intermediate lacrosse braves are evidently mixing the colors for their season's war paint, judging by the numerous meetings now being held and the genial smile which frequently lights up the face of one of the intermediate princes of lobbyists who is on the warpath as an organizer of certain combinations. The seniors are for the moment lost in the meshes of obscurity, and no other subject is now being discussed by lacrosse people except what clubs will constitute the intermediate championship league during the coming summer. In the West, the feeling seems to be to give the Quebecers the cold shoulder, but in this city, especially amongst the Shamrocks, the idea seems to be to have the Quebecers in the combination. Then, again, there is the Nationals club to count upon. They are going to be considerably more than a cipher in the grand total which will be made up at the end of the season. There seems to be no reference made whatever to them. The Crescents and the disgruntled members of the ex-champion team are seemingly going to unite their forces, but the question again arises, will they have any place in the favorite league? It seems impossible to have more than two teams entered from this city in any championship league which will include teams from Ottawa and Quebec and, perhaps, Brockville, because the length of the season would not permit it unless the middlemen are anxious for a repetition of that sickly spectacle of playing a match in a blizzard, such as occurred at Ottawa last season. Those are the following clubs, which would make an excellent and interesting league series: Young Shamrocks, Quebec, Stars of Ottawa, Ottawa, Nationals, Brockville, and Montrealers. It is even doubtful if the latter will enter against the other clubs named, because the Juniors, which played intermediate last year, in all probability may rather desire to look for the junior district championship against the Junior Shamrocks and the Junior Nationals as well as a number of other junior clubs who are now seeking a place in another series. The coming battle for league building will create quite a little stir, as the Crescents will make a lively bid for a place. At present, it looks as though they might be out of the race with the first-class teams in the intermediate series. Another feature of the rumors in connection with the movements of the intermediates is that they are growing less enthusiastic in their views regarding the usefulness of the Nationals.

**AT THE HORSE SHOW**  
Perhaps the most attractive feature at the horse show yesterday was the exhibition under the auspices of the Montreal Hunt. These classes provided something different from the usual run of agricultural shows and resulted in proving that there is really better horse flesh and more showy than is usually thought of in this part of the country. We cannot run a week's show as they do in New York, and unfortunately have not the constituency to cater to who care for horses, as is the case in Toronto. But when these disabilities are taken into consideration, there is only credit to be given to the Montreal Hunt, whose members are naturally anxious that everything equine should be up to the top notch. In the harness classes, there was as neat an all-round turn-out as could be wished for, and the decision of the judges gave general satisfaction, with perhaps the exception of class 5, single horses in harness, over 15.2. General opinion seemed to favor the style of Mr. Meighen's horse, but the judges thought otherwise, and that settled it. There was not a large attendance, but those who were there knew the difference between a horse and any other animal. Among the most interested spectators was Mr. Koutledge, of Virden, Manitoba, who is a thorough believer in the Canadian Northwest as a breeding country, and who has been following up precept by example. He has been breeding a good thoroughbred, Dean Swift, to the best half-bred mares he could find, and the result is a splendid lot on the ranch, of which he has brought eleven east, all thoroughly broken. A particularly nice one is a thoroughbred filly by Dean Swift, dam Queen of the West by imp Norfolk out of Grace Darling. The dam has done a mile in 1:42. There is also a fine looking two-year-old thoroughbred by Dean Swift that horsemen will take an interest in.

**Alexander Island Race**  
Alexander Island, April 25. The heat was intense and the majority of the crowd picked winners and elbowed through the betting ring in shirt sleeves. The attendance was fully up to the average. The track was dry and the jockeys have been reinstated. President Jones was asked today what he would do in case St. Asaph raced in opposition to his track. He said he had given the matter no thought and would not until he was certain opposition was certain. First race 6½ furlongs: Commuter, 110 Morris, 1 to 2, 1; Blizzard, 110 Ham, 15 to 1, 2.

An unusually quick drop in the temperature was anything but pleasant. The records at the Observatory showed that such a prolonged spell of hot weather as last week has seldom been experienced, even in mid-summer. During six days, the highest temperature at three PM was 87, the lowest 81, and the mean 84, with corresponding high readings during the afternoon and night. Between Saturday night and noon yesterday, there was a drop of 24 degrees. That was the reason city people felt chilled. Yet they were not alone in their experience. The cold snap has extended west as far as Ohio and Michigan, east to Quebec, and south over the northern half of New York, affecting early fruit more or less severely within these bounds. Complete reports are not yet to hand, but it is feared the damage will be great. According to dispatches from the Niagara Peninsula received in this city yesterday, the destruction of early fruit in that district has been terrible, while there is scarcely an intervening fruit section that has not felt the effects of the cool snap. The following message from St. Catharines, Ont., received yesterday by Messrs. Hart & Tuckwell, the well-known fruit dealers of McGill Street, gives an indication of the damage done in that section of the country. It stated: "The thermometer, which ranged between 85 and 90 degrees most of last week, took a sudden drop on Sunday morning, and during Sunday night and Monday morning, sad havoc was wrought in the Niagara district. Hundreds of acres of grapes, just bursting into leaf, were burned black. Peaches and garden stuff are also probably ruined. Altogether, the blow to the fruit-growing industry here is a severe one. At five o'clock this morning, the thermometer registered from 21 to 26 degrees, according to location." 

Further messages received by this firm from Windsor, Meaford, Niagara, Ont., Chatham, Thorold, Port Dalhousie, Hamilton, Paris, Beamsville, Amherstburg, Toronto, and other places show that great damage was done by frost Sunday night. Plums, early apples, pears, grapes, strawberries, and other small fruits, where advanced enough, especially suffered. The thermometer had registered as low as 25 at some points. Grain had escaped, but mention of strawberries was made in nearly all of the reports. Around Port Dalhousie, a dispatch stated, ice had been an inch thick. Hopes were entertained that the grapes would recover. 

"A very serious disaster to the fruit growers of the peninsula," said Mr. Hart, commenting on the dispatches, "that is, the Niagara district, because they depend upon their fruit crop altogether, but the outlook may not be as bad as the reports make it appear. Again, it may turn out very much worse than anticipated; it is almost impossible that the ground could have been all gone over yet or that the fruit growers could have compared notes so soon. Peas, tomatoes, beans, and small fruit come under the head of what is called 'garden stuff.' Although we have had no reports, I understand there has been no frost locally. A good many of the strawberry beds all over the country must be protected by hills, and I hope the fruit has not been so much injured as anticipated. At all events, it is too early yet to form an opinion as to what the extent of the damage will be. We cannot tell where we will draw our supplies from until we hear further reports."

Across the Lines: Detroit, Mich., May 13. Reports from 9 to 11 inches of snow; Davison, 10 inches; Oscoda, 3 inches and still snowing; Lewiston, 8 inches and still snowing; Menominee, 4 inches with all gardens and many fruit and shade trees ruined, and Manistee, 2 inches. The frost did no damage to fruit trees at Grand Haven, and it is believed that generally throughout the state, fruit has escaped serious injury. 

Grand Rapids, Mich., May 13. Western and Northern Michigan was visited by a heavy storm today, and grave fears are felt for fruit, as the storm is heaviest throughout the fruit belt. In this city, the fall of snow commenced about 3 PM and is not as great as is reported from the northern part of the state, where railroad traffic is badly hindered. At Mancelona, snow to the depth of 18 inches is reported. The snow is accompanied by a fierce north wind. 

Pittsburgh, May 11. Dispatches from points in Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, and West Virginia show that the cold wave last night was general in these localities, and that vegetables of all kinds suffered greatly from the heavy frosts. In many places, the thermometer fell from 5 to 10 degrees below the freezing point. At some points, ice over an inch thick was formed. 

North East, Pa., May 13. The grape crop in this vicinity is damaged to the estimated extent of $100,000. Milwaukee, May 13. Reports received here from all sections of Wisconsin indicate a general frost accompanied in many parts by high wind and snow, reaching in some cases the severity of a blizzard. The freezing weather and snow began last night and continued throughout the day. Early fruit and vegetables, as well as much grain, have been destroyed by the sudden fall in temperature. 

Rock Falls, May 13. Reports from numerous sections of this state show that heavy damage was done last night by frost to fruit and garden truck. Corn that was up is reported to have been nipped to the ground. 

Champaign, Ill., May 13. Up to the present time, the cold weather has done no serious damage to Illinois crops, but there is every indication that there will be a heavy frost before morning in Central Illinois. It will doubtless do much damage to fruit, but wheat and corn are considered out of danger. 

Chicago, May 13. The ball game here today between New York and Chicago was postponed on account of the snowfall. 

La Porte, Ind., May 13. Northern Indiana was visited by a snowstorm today which raged for several hours. The cold has increased greatly, and it is feared all growing vegetation has been seriously injured. A blizzard is blowing tonight. 

South Bend, Ind., May 13. A blinding snowstorm has been raging here since 4 o'clock this afternoon with the temperature four degrees above freezing. 

St. Louis, Mo., May 13. A severe cold wave prevails throughout Missouri, and in many places, heavy frosts occurred last night. In the southwestern portion of the state, considerable damage to fruit and vegetable crops is reported. A heavy westerly wind saved growing wheat. 

Buffalo, May 13. Frost last night ruined the Chautauqua grape crop, and reports from other grape regions are to the effect that the crop is either partially or totally destroyed. The Western New York fruit belt reports that nearly all fruit has been damaged and in some cases totally destroyed. The loss is incalculable as many farmers had almost wholly given up general farming and turned their efforts toward fruit culture. Early tomatoes, cucumbers, and small vegetables are also ruined and will have to be replanted. 

Dunkirk, N.Y., May 13. The loss in Chautauqua's grapevines is estimated at a million and a half. Loss to others directly and indirectly interested in fruit raising will exceed $500,000. 

Saranac Lake, May 13. The thermometer is at the freezing point here tonight, a drop of 58 degrees in two days. There was a slight fall of snow today. The surrounding mountains are covered with snow. 

THE HYAMS' CASE. Expressman Fox Gives Some Interesting Evidence. Toronto, May 13. In the Hyams' murder trial this morning, Mr. Osier, at the opening of the court, announced that Mrs.

At the fall of the flag, it looked as if Starter McLaughlin had made a gift of the race to Running Bird, as that animal got fully three lengths the best of the send-off. Running and Coquette, with Foam a good fourth, were the next to be distinguished. The rest of the field were bunched. Running Bird reported his performance of yesterday and ran like a startled deer up the stretch when Coquette, who had been running well, overhauled him and lapped with the son of Kunnymede for some yards before she drew away and won by a half length. Foam was third, about a length away. Martello, after running fifth nearly the whole distance, beat Runaway out for fourth place at the wire.

18951114: At grounds, the board of Directors having granted the club the exclusive use of them for that afternoon, which the committee very much appreciated, as it greatly facilitated the work at the races. Permission having been obtained from the executive of the Amateur Athletic Association of Canada, three championship events were held, viz., 110 yards hurdles, 220 yards, and 833 yards. The track was in very soft condition, and the weather terrific, a perfect blizzard setting in on Friday morning, which lasted until Saturday morning. The committee worked hard to make these meets a success, having secured a very large list of entries, some sixty-three, besides having them extremely well advertised, as many will remember who were on St. James Street. The events were well contested, and our club had the good fortune to win six firsts and four seconds out of seven open events. In the evening of the same day, the fifty-fifth annual dinner was held in the Windsor Hotel, when 138 members sat down. This was one of the finest dinners held by the club, both as regards the menu, table decorations, and the number present. The members of the Association, through the President, Mr.

18951120: R notice of its intention to pay the amount due was withdrawn at the request of the Government. The theory has suffered much, however, by contact with events that have transpired since it had its birth, and yesterday's discussion will probably be the end of it. A commission is to be appointed to arrange the details of the Pacific cable scheme, and the cable also brings confirmation of the report that the Imperial Government will give assistance to the fast Atlantic service. Both these projects have seemed to hang fire a little, but when one considers the vast number of affairs, domestic and foreign, the British Government has to consider, it is not surprising that there should be delay. Perhaps the Dominion Government has not lost anything by the postponement. Both projects are for the permanent benefit of the Dominion, but they involve a considerable expenditure of Canadian money, and there need be no very particular hurry about assuming the burden. While Mr. Laurier is recommending "free trade as it is in England," to Canadian farmers, the English farmers are calling out for protection as it is in Canada, and duties on wheat and other cereals. If this should be pointed out to Mr. Laurier, he would, doubtless, reply that the circumstances of Great Britain and Canada are entirely different. If so, why urge on Canada a fiscal policy which England alone, of all the nations in the world, has ventured to adopt? A New York Central engineer has been killed and several postal clerks injured in a wreck caused by a number of young men whose heads had been turned by reading the exploits of train-robbing adventurers. The culprits are in custody and will probably get a taste of the robbers' punishment. It is a pity some of it could not be also administered to the publishers of the misleading books, as accessories before the crime. They deserve it. Mr. John Morley is to re-enter public life as the member for Montrose. His defeat at Newcastle was one of the incidents of battle which even the Conservatives regretted, though they gloried in the party triumph, and his return to the House of Commons will be warmly welcomed by men of all parties. Even his opponents admire his intellectual capabilities.

Intellectual power and his adherence to principle, and Parliament has been the poorer by his absence. That great shouter for economy, Mr. George W. Stephens, does not seem to have been present in the Legislature yesterday to vote for a reduction of the sessional indemnity, and to effect a saving of $20,000 a year to the Provincial Treasury. He will probably make up for the neglect, however, by louder shouting sometime, when he has nothing to lose. Mr. Stephens' shouts are always more inspiring than his votes. Mr. Goldwin Smith has favored the Saturday Review with an article on Canadian copyright and other matters, including patents and divorce. There is no objection to this, so long as it is understood that the writer only represents Mr. Goldwin Smith; but if English readers suppose that what the Professor says represents any considerable body of feeling in Canada, they are very much mistaken. Both Mr. Taillon, the leader of the Government, and Mr. Marchand, the leader of the Opposition, voted with the minority in the Legislature when the resolution in favor of a reduction of the sessional indemnity was killed. In their cases, conspicuous ability seems to go with seeming modesty. An outbreak of the old hostility to the English Sparrow is noted in some Canadian newspapers. This pugnacious feathered immigrant seems to be absolutely without friends on this continent. He also seems to be built on a plan to get along without them. Premier Canovas del Castillo says no negotiations with the Cuban rebels will be entered into. This sounds assuring from a Spanish point of view; but a sound thrashing of one of the rebel bands would be more convincing to outsiders. The early arrival of a blizzard is predicted by the weather observers, and we are only one day from the great Thanksgiving football festival!

1895-12-13: S, December 12. Mail steamer Soloman, of the Dominion line, arrived here this afternoon at 3:30, after a 12-days' passage. There was a strong wind and tide, and as the steamer is over 4,000 tons, it was nearly 6 o'clock when she was docked. The Dominion Government wharves were burned last winter and are not yet sufficiently rebuilt for use, and the mail boats dock at the Cunard's wharves. The docking was only accomplished by the aid of tugs. The Scotsman fouled the steamer Mackay-Bennett in coming into dock and did slight damage to the cable boat. The captain of the Scotsman says that in all his experience at sea, he never had such a rough voyage. Almost from the time he left the coast of Ireland, he met gales, nearly always from the westward, but one blow was from the southwest. So strong was the wind that some days the ship could hardly keep steering way. In one twenty-four hours, the vessel made but 108 miles, and in another 111 miles. From yesterday morning, the steamer was in a blizzard. The wind blew with hurricane force, and the snow was so thick that one could not see half the length of the ship. The seas were simply tremendous. One struck the steamer on the stern and smashed in a door, ruining much of the ship's stores. She brought 150 passengers. The Scotsman did not see any other steamer; in fact, she did not see enough to take a sight for eight days, so thick was the weather. The following are her saloon passengers: R.

1895-12-27: BIG WIND STORM. Philadelphia and Indianapolis Fared Badly Yesterday. Philadelphia, December 20. The high wind that accompanied tonight's rainstorm nearly caused a terrible disaster at the Mariners' Bethel Church, at Front and Union Street. A Christmas tree celebration was being held at the Church, and the building was packed with about six hundred people. Just before 10 o'clock, the people were startled by what sounded like a heavy blow on the roof above their heads. The noise was followed by falling bricks and mortar, and in the effort to escape from the impending danger, a wild panic ensued among the people. A rush was made for the single exit, and men, women, and children were trampled underfoot in the rush for safety. Although a number of people were knocked down in the flight from the church, and a number of others were cut by the falling bricks and mortar, no one was very seriously hurt. An examination of the cause of the panic showed that about half of the roof of the building had been lifted off by the wind. 

Indianapolis, Ind., December 20. A blizzard struck this city early this morning and continued with increased violence until noon, when the streets were almost impassable and the telephone and electric light wires were in a tangled mass. Not a telephone is in working order in the city, and at least fifty poles were broken off or toppled over. One horse was killed and several persons knocked senseless by coming in contact with live wires. Large gangs of men are at work trying to get the wires off the streets, but the storm is increasing in force. 

TWO MEN NAMED. Members of President Cleveland's Venezuelan Commission. New York, December 20. A morning paper has the following special from Washington: The President has tendered places on the Venezuelan High Commission to Edwin J. Phelps, of Vermont, ex-Minister to England, and Hubert T. Lincoln, also ex-Minister to England. Their acceptances have not been received, and the third place on the High Commission will not be filled until Mr. Phelps and Mr. Lincoln accept. Mr. Lincoln was Secretary Olney's own selection, and it is said that Chief Justice Fuller, of Illinois, strongly recommended him on the ground that a report signed by two former American Ministers to England, both of whom have been warmly praised by the British press for many years, will have much weight in Great Britain. 

New York, December 20. A Washington special to the Sun says: The National Guard, on the whole, has been found energetic and industrious, but except in a few states, such as New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Ohio, the equipment is wretchedly bad and the organization not on sound military basis. The first thing that should be done, it is claimed, by the leading army officers in Washington, is to determine the best small arms yet produced, and then to issue them to all state troops. It is asserted that there should be only one design of small arm for all military purposes, to avoid the possibility of the navy getting cartridges intended for the army and state troops. It is believed that what all experts regard as necessary for the country's protection are powerful fortifications at the principal sea-coast cities. Advantage will be taken this session of the war scare to also provide more battleships and torpedo boats for the navy. Officials of the War and Navy Departments concede that the events of the past week have contributed more toward impressing upon Congress and the country the evil results of a niggardly policy with regard to defense than all the pleas that have been made in ten years. In one week, it becomes apparent that the country would be practically at the mercy of a strong force for at least a year, and perhaps longer, before the resources at hand would yield a defense sufficient to eventually defeat an enemy. The unanimity with which bills have been presented in Congress by members of both parties for an increase of the naval establishment, an enlargement of the standing army, and provision for powerful coast defenses, the purchase of millions of small arms and large ordnance for the national forces and the National Guards, is accepted as proof of determination to make more liberal appropriations for the services this winter than in any similar period since the war. 

New York, December 20. The following dispatch was received today by the Chamber of Commerce: Edinburgh, December 26, 1893. To the Chamber of Commerce, New York: The Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce expresses its earnest desire that the present difficulty may end in the continuance of peaceful relations between both countries, so closely allied by kindred language and mutual interests. Thomas Clark, Dart, President. 

London, December 20. The Daily News will tomorrow publish a dispatch from Vienna, stating that Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister, is negotiating with France and Holland, with a view to adopting common action against the policy of President Cleveland. Spain, the dispatch adds, has already assured Great Britain of her agreement with the latter on the question. It is believed that Great Britain, France, Holland, and Spain will form a quadrilateral alliance to protect their American possessions against the United States. 

London, December 20. The Daily Herald tomorrow, commenting on the report that Secretary of State Olney has forwarded a private dispatch to Lord Salisbury, will say: "There is nothing incredible or surprising in such an announcement. On the contrary, it would be highly honorable to him. There is no reason to believe that in pushing the Monroe doctrine, Secretary Olney has any design of insulting or annoying England." The paper discredits the far-fetched explanations of President Cleveland's policy and says he meant no harm by his message to Congress. Whatever mischief he did, he has since conscientiously and laboriously endeavored to undo.

from my neighbor, Laurier. Now, VLADIVOSTOK What the Great Russian Pacific Post Is Like (Fortnightly Review) Vladivostok has the aspect of an inferior Hong-Kong, of about a quarter the size. Hills crowned with forts rise round it up to a height of 800 feet. It lies on the south side of a peninsula 20 miles long, called Mara-vich, Amursky, in 43 degrees 6 minutes 61 seconds north latitude and 131 degrees 54 minutes 21 seconds east longitude. The town is between four and five miles long, but is straggling and unconnected, and of no breadth. Some streets are very steep, and all are horribly dusty in dry weather, being never watered, and being continually crossed in all directions by droshkies driven at a smart pace. Instead of pavements, the streets have "sidewalks" of planks, as commonly seen in new American cities. You take six stout planks, some 25 feet long, and lay them side by side, and you continue the process for the requisite number of versts (three versts are two miles), and the "sidewalk" is complete, save for a few props and nails where the ground is too soft, or the foundation degenerated into holes. The droshkies are driven by red-headed, snub-nosed Russian vozchiks in low, glazed, stovepipe huts, with very curly brims, red sleeves, pleated black skirts, and high boots. In them, one often sees, lolling at passengers, a couple of frowsy Chinese, or a still frowsier Korean. The fare is only 80 kopeks, or one shilling and eightpence an hour (or over half an hour), and, from point to point, there are tenpenny and fivepenny fares, according to distance. The regulations forbid charging more, but, with fine irony, allow the driver "to take less, if he likes." He may not leave his cab to take care of itself, may not "sing, make a noise, or cause a disturbance"; he must temper his pace to a "town trot," and "keep to the right-hand side of the road." The troika has a dashing look; the horse in the middle trots under the arched yoke, whose object and effect, when properly put on, is to keep the shafts at the same distance apart. The small horses right and left are cantering, and their bodies incline a little outward from the car. In Vladivostok, there are few complete triple teams; generally, there are only the "middle horse," trotting, and one other cantering on its near side. The water-barrel on wheels, drawn by horse or bull, and often driven by a soldier, is a frequent sight, carrying water up to the fort and to the upper town. A funnier horse vehicle is the sit-aside, cushioned beam, on which the vozchik and cloaked and spurred officer sit, with dangling legs, one behind the other, the officer behind.

18960205: E L) said that the debate in the afternoon could hardly be considered obstructive, as it was taken part in by several members on the Government side of the House. He then took up the order paper and discussed the bills set down in the names of private members one by one. Mr. Davin stirs 'em up. Mr. Davin described Mr. Davies as "the windmill of the Opposition" and said that, tonight, his machinery had been fully oiled and was driven by a first-class blizzard. Mr. Laurier had appeared in a less favorable light than usual, and Mr. Davies' conduct had been more discreditable (Cries of order). Mr. Mulock drew the Speaker's attention to the expression "discreditable," and the speaker ruled it out of order. Mr. Davin withdrew and said he meant to say "less creditable" (Laughter). He went on to speak of Mr. Davies' speech as "a migrant manifestation of obstructive tactics" (Opposition cries of "That is not Parliamentary"). Mr. Ives: It is the truth, Parliamentary or not. Mr. Martin: The hon. member of Assiniboia has charged the hon. member for Queen's with having been guilty of obstructive tactics. It is a reflection on the hon. member, which is not justified by the rules of this House. Sir C...

18960208: I O'MKIN, February 7 A despatch to the United Press from Constantinople says the negotiations for the surrender of Zeitoun, which place is held by the Armenians, to the Turkish authorities, continue. The foreign consuls at Zeitoun have informed the beleaguered Armenians that their principal purpose in visiting Zeitoun is to watch the course of events, and that they will guarantee the safety of the Zeitounites upon any conditions. The Turkish troops besieging the town are mainly composed of reserves. They are ill-fed, and many of them are deserting. The main body of the Turks have retreated to Marasch. The only article of provisions lacking by the beleaguered Armenians is salt. Pakih, February 7 Miss Clara Barton, President of the American Red Cross Society, with her party, started for Geneva today. NEWS FROM TORONTO A Rather Severe Storm up West—Mantel Manufacturers Fall (From our own correspondent) Toronto, February 7 The storm that came here in the form of rain visited the outlying districts in a blizzard-like way, and the railways have more than their share of snow. All trains are more or less late. The Canadian Pacific, from the East, was three hours overdue, and the Owen Sound train was an hour late. The Grand Trunk trains were from ten minutes to half an hour late, the locomotives being banked up to the headlight with snow. The Canadian Pacific Nervous Prostration It is now well established fact that nervousness is due to impure blood. Therefore the best way to cure nervousness is by purifying and enriching the blood. The great blood purifier is Hood's Sarsaparilla. I read this letter: "For the last two years I have been a great sufferer with nervous prostration and palpitation of the heart. I was weak in my limbs and had other sensations. At last, my physician advised me to try Hood's Sarsaparilla, which I did, and I am happy to say that I am now strong and well. I am still taking Hood's Sarsaparilla and would not be without it. I recommend it to all who are suffering with nervous prostration and palpitation of the heart." M. DAVIDSON, 8 Alio St., Toronto, Ontario. Q. Hood's, because Hood's Sarsaparilla is the only true blood purifier prominently before the public eye today. It is not what we say, but what Hood's Sarsaparilla does that tells the story. Hood's pills—easy to take, easy to operate. 9 cents a box for every day.

18960213: H. Pearce, of Kingston, Jamaica, British West Indies. Mr. Pearce is one of the prominent citizens of the place and has entire control of the postal and telegraph systems of Jamaica. When Mr. Pearce arrived at the Hall on Tuesday evening, he had to deny himself to a Gazette reporter due to the very sudden change from the tropical climate he was accustomed to, and the miniature blizzard blowing in Montreal had resulted in a bad cold. Mr. Pearce was seen yesterday afternoon, however, and had many interesting things to say about his country. In coming to America, besides traveling for his health, which has not been very strong since an attack of illness some time ago, he has an object in view in visiting and inspecting the postal and telegraph systems in the large cities both of the United States and Canada. In New York and Boston, he inspected the post offices, and, before leaving the United States, spent a few days in Baltimore and other cities. He inspected the Montreal office yesterday and called upon the Postmaster. Before coming to Canada at all, the Governor of the Island had written to His Excellency, asking that Mr. Pearce be given all possible facilities for improving the large Post Office in Canada, which has been done. Mr. Pearce has, naturally, a great love and admiration for his own beautiful country. "I don't think people, generally, have an idea what a magnificent health resort it is," he said. "We have mountains 7,000 feet in height, and the climate is admirably suited for invalids, especially those afflicted with lung troubles. Indeed, it is very often a positive cure for the latter. The temperature in the winter in the lowlands is never below 50 degrees, while in summer it goes up to about 94 or 96. Yet we have the hills to go to in summer, where the weather is always delightfully cool, and, even in the lowlands, the heat is always tempered by the delicious trade winds." From Mr. Pearce's description, Jamaica must indeed be a delightful place for a winter sojourn, especially when we bear in mind that there are several first-class hotels, where one may live at the rate of $50 a month, a not very exorbitant price. "How is the trade of the Island progressing?" was asked. "Oh, very well," he responded. "The failure of the orange crop in Florida has given us a great boon in Jamaica. Our oranges are as fine in every respect as those of Florida, and we never run the risk of a failure in the crop through frost, for frost is unknown in Jamaica. As you know, we export sugar, rum, cocoa, chocolate, and all kinds of fruit." He spoke of the export of grape fruit, which this year is becoming larger, and which promises to become one of the most largely exported fruits of all. The trade in rum, he said, was not as huge as formerly. It was not made in such large quantities; whiskey seemed to be taking its place, and he regarded the spread of temperance as also doing away with it. "Has the insurrection in Cuba had any material effect either on the Island or its trade?" "None at all," was the decided answer. "It has increased the price of sugar somewhat, but that is all." Another industry that Mr. Pearce mentioned was the making of cigars in Jamaica. "We make very good Havana cigars there," he said, "and the business is increasing." He also spoke, in general terms, of the fruit trade with Jamaica. It needed a good deal of capital and a great deal of personal supervision. "There are two firms doing a very large trade with the United States: the Boston Fruit Company and J...

18960409: B. Congdon & Co., of Chicago, write, under date of April 6th, as follows: Wheat active and strong at sharply advanced prices, closing 2 cents up. There is an increasing apprehension regarding crop prospects on account of cold, dry, backward spring, which is intensified by unfavorable State crop reports. Following that of Indiana, which we quoted Saturday, came a confirmation from Ohio of the rumor current a few days since making condition 57. Later, the Missouri report of condition 77, and probable abandonment of 10 percent of the area, added fuel to the flames, and there was a genuine scramble to buy that soon absorbed all offerings. A close holiday abroad, but a London cable quoted a curb market 1/8 higher, and the Liverpool Corn Trade next cabled world's shipments only 4,650,000 bushels, and amount on passage decreased 960,000 bushels. Northwestern receipts moderate, with no blizzard or other apology at hand to account therefor. Minneapolis reported a big demand for flour, and predict a decrease in their stock of wheat this week. The visible supply made a good decrease considering so little wheat is available for export. The day's figures show but 1,300,000 remaining in New York, and but 8,000,000 all told outside of Chicago, Duluth, and Minneapolis. The supply and demand situation is nearing the acute stage steadily and surely, and, if we are to have an impaired crop prospect as well, there is no telling where the advance will stop. Cable advices to the Board of Trade this morning were as follows: Carg...

There was some enquiry for Manitoba wheat today, and 64s was bid for 10,000 bushels of No 2 hard, and No 1 hard is now held at 67s afloat, Fort William, May shipment. In peas and oats, business was quiet and prices about steady. Peas, per 60 lbs $0.55 to $1.10. No 1 oats, per 34 lbs $0.00 to $0.02. Corn, duly paid $0.49 to $0.47. Barley, feed $0.38 to $0.39. Barley, malting $0.40 to $0.48. Rye $0.00 to $0.00. Buckwheat, per 48 lbs $0.38 to $0.40. Manitoba flour was unsettled today and difficult to quote. The smaller holders have been underselling the big millers as much as $0.50 to $0.60 per barrel. The latter have got their dander up, and what they are selling at is known only to themselves. In consequence of this, no quotation is given today either on Manitoba patents or strong bakers, and cannot be until the cutting is stopped. The volume of business in both was quite extensive. Winter wheat $4.25 to $4.85. Spring wheat, patents $0.00 to $0.00. Manitoba roller $3.85 to $3.10. Straight roller, bags $1.85 to $1.90. Extra $0.00 to $0.00. Extra, bags $1.65 to $1.75.

Dried fruit, lbs $2.00 to $3.00. Rolled wheat, per 100 lbs $2.40 to $2.50. A fairly active trade continues in food, and prices are fully maintained. Bran $14.00 to $15.00. Shorts $14.00 to $16.10. Molasses $12.00 to $13.00. The demand for hay continues easy and the market is moderately active and firm at the recent advance. Sales of No 1 were made at $14, and No 2 at $13 per ton in car lots on track. Toronto, April 8. The market is quiet. Flour, quiet and featureless; straight rollers, quoted at $3.50, Toronto freights. Bran, little doing; cars quoted at $10.75 to $11.00. West Wheat, dull; the tone firmer, owing to strength of the outside market. Wheat is quoted at 75c to 76c, and red at 75c on the Northern. No 1 Manitoba hard offered at 82c, North Bay, with 79c bid, and at 81c, grinding in transit, Sarnia, with 80c bid; No 2 hard at 75c bid North Bay and 77c bid, grinding in transit, with sellers at 80c; No 1 Northern offered at 78c, North Bay, with 75½c bid, and No 1 frosted offered at 70c, North Bay, without bids. Barley, dull; prices steady; No 1 quoted outside at 40c; No 2 at 33c, and No 3 extra at 31c. Feed barley offers at 29c outside. Oats, quiet; prices unchanged; white sold at 22c outside, and mixed at 21c to 21½c outside. Peas, very dull; offerings outside at 49c. Buckwheat, steady; sales on Midland at 31¼c. Oatmeal, quiet; prices nominal, at $2.80 to $2.85 on track. Corn, steady; mixed quoted at 31c to 31½c outside, and yellow at 31.40 to 32c. Rye, dull; quotations nominal at 43c to 44c outside. Winnipeg, Man., April 8. The feeling in Manitoba wheat was very strong yesterday at the Winnipeg Grain Exchange on account of the advance in American markets, and No 1 hard sold as high as 68 cents for immediate delivery, but very little offered at this price, as the trade do not feel disposed to sell under 70 cents, which they expect to get in a few days and some think, as Armour does, that wheat will sell at $1 before the new crop. If the markets go as Armour predicts, a great many will make a good haul. Some of the Winnipeg crowd that are large holders of Manitoba wheat have had excellent offers for May and June shipments from Fort William. All Manitoba wheat was withdrawn from the market, or, in other words, was placed at a figure which it was impossible to sell at today. It is rumored around that a great many outside of the grain trade have been heavy buyers of American wheat, which stands them today a good profit. An evening paper, editorially speaking of Armour's prediction that wheat will go to a dollar a bushel, says: "It is difficult to estimate how far such advance would benefit the farmers of Manitoba. Much of their last year's crop was marketed before the close of navigation; of the balance, more or less has gone into the country elevators and passed into the hands of the dealer or mill man. In some sections, however, a large amount is still owned, and the profit of an advance would be reaped by the farmer, and it is safe to say therefore that such an increase in price would mean many hundreds of thousands of dollars to the farming wealth of Manitoba."

18960414: READ WESTERN STORM Colorado Railways Tied up by a Snowstorm - Loss of Life Feared. Denver, Col., April 13. Denver yesterday was the center of one of the worst storms that ever blew over the western country. East of here the country is inundated with from a foot to three feet of water, while on the south and west meager reports tell of disastrous snow blizzards that have swept away every vestige of animal life in the country. At Pueblo cars were blown from the track and piled up in the ditches. Only one eastern passenger train arrived here. Up to midnight, drifts ranged as high as twenty feet and, without shelter, there is no prospect of livestock escaping the fury of the elements. Not a train is moving on the first division of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad, while the Gulf road is blocked from here to Trinidad. The Santa Fe is the only road that is handling business, as its tracks are slightly higher than those of its competitors. Cripple Creek reports the greatest loss, and fatalities are feared in the hills surrounding the camp, where several hundred men are prospecting without any protection from the storm. Five buildings in Cripple Creek were blown down, including a three-story store and a lodging house occupied by 24 men and a residence occupied by Fred Bierberwer, paying teller of the First National Bank. The wind ranged from 50 to 80 miles an hour. At Lander, Wyo., there was a mud storm, preceded by snow that covered the ground to the depth of two inches; following this came a shower of red mud, succeeded by a fall of black mud that covered houses and people with a slimy coat.

Last evening three "prairie schooners," drawn by mules, crossed by ferry boat from Detroit, and after arranging matters with the customs officer, proceeded on their journey east. Twelve years ago Thomas Markus sold his farm near Toronto and, with his family, set out for Nebraska. Between cyclones and blizzards, Markus soon found that farming in the West wasn't all it was reputed to be. Bad crops for the last two seasons decided the matter, and two months ago Markus packed his wife and children in a covered wagon and, with a neighbor for company, started for Canada. He has been on the road ever since and expects to cover the remaining distance to his destination in about two weeks. Joint Traffic Association. New York, June 18 -- The question of differentials on passenger business was before the Board of Managers of the Joint Traffic Association today. The Panhandle, one of the Pennsylvania lines, asked for a differential of $2 on the route from Chicago to New York, which would bring the rate down to $28. The Baltimore & Ohio asked for the same differential from St. Louis, Louisville, Cincinnati, and Hamilton; the Erie asked for a differential of $1 from Cincinnati. The Board of Managers took the matter under consideration. Drive out the impurities from your blood with Hood's Sarsaparilla and thus avoid that tired, languid feeling and even serious illness.

North American Review. Education In Switzerland. A report from the British Legation in Berne, which has just been published by the Foreign Office, refers to the educational system of Switzerland. Education there is encouraged and developed to a wonderful degree. The gratuitous distribution of food and clothing to poor children in elementary schools is made when they have long journeys to make, or when the weather in winter is very bad, and they have to remain during the middle of the day in school. In reply to a Government circular on the subject, 1,087 schools wished for assistance under this head; in 50 schools something was already done in this direction for the children, and many were altogether opposed to it on the ground that in many cantons it was not required, and was needed only for those in the mountain districts. The Swiss have not only shown great zeal for education, but also a great spirit of religious toleration in all that concerns their educational system. In some cantons, where the population is mixed Protestant and Catholic, religious instruction is given on a fixed day and at stated hours, so that if parents wish their children to have nothing but a secular education they can be absent during that time. Mixed schools also exist in some cantons, and are attended by children of both communions. These cannot be called secular schools, for in a canton like Zurich, for instance, where Protestants are in the majority, a Roman Catholic child receives instruction in the elements of Christianity, with readings from the Bible, with his Protestant school fellows, until he is ten or eleven years old, when his special preparation for confirmation by his own pastor begins. This system also prevails in St. Gallen, where the Roman Catholics are almost double the Protestants in number. School administration, organization, and instruction are in the hands of each canton, and elementary education is compulsory everywhere. In 1893 the cost of education was about 10s for each inhabitant, and there is about a similar amount per head of the population given in Federal subventions for educational purposes. - London Times.

They may think themselves. Not only do the insiders have the concoction of the various companies and the fixing of their original capitalization, which practically determines their future value, but they have the entire management of them. They can decide which of the half dozen is to pay the big dividends and which are to draw blanks. They have all the initiative, do all the manipulating, and can arrange every new scheme to suit themselves. They might even strip a company of its assets and reduce it to an empty husk before the shareholders could interfere to prevent them. The proprietary or parent company is, in that respect, most at their mercy. Say that it starts with so many dollars to develop a thousand; it may be, and it divides them up among four or five working companies. The usual course is to receive in payment of the claims a certain number of the sub-companies' shares. These pass into the treasury of the parent company, but there is no obligation on the directors to keep them longer than they please, and no guarantee to the shareholders that they will be kept. They may be sold, pawned, exchanged, or put in trust, at the pleasure of the directors, who have invariably proxies enough to give them complete control.

National Review: The Hamburg Lie. For reference see Ben Jonson, "The Alchemist," IV, 1, where Sir Epicure Mammon goes into raptures over Doll disguised as a noble lady: "There is a strange nobility in your eye, thin lip, that chin! Methinks you do resemble one of the Austrian Princes." Face comments amusingly in an aside: "Very like!" Her father was an Irish costumer. Gifford, in a note on the above, quotes Bulwer, "The Artificial Change," page 173: "It is observed that all of the house of Austria have a sweet fullness of the lower lip. The Austrian lip being at this day, therefore, by good right in high esteem;" and Shirley, Hyde Park: "Your lip is Austrian, and you do well to bite it." And finally, "Swift gives the Austrian lip to the potent Emperor of Lilliput."

Notes and Queries: Hailstorm in the Orange Free State. One of these republics, the Orange Free State, is very nearly as large as England and just as large as the State of New York. It lies from 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea and is mostly level, with some low ranges of hills. The surface is bare of wood, except in a few sheltered spots along the streams, but is well watered. The air is pure and bracing, much like that of Colorado or Wyoming. There are happily no blizzards, but violent thunderstorms are not uncommon, and the hailstones I have seen are bigger than pigeon eggs, which fall during such storms sometimes kill the smaller animals and even men.

1896-10-27: Bryan has set himself to gain, and on it will depend whether the McKinley vote will be zeroed out or only enough to send him to Washington. According to some of the Paris papers, Bismarck, at the time of the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria, and Italy, was strongest, and the Russo-French alliance was new, had an arrangement by which Russia, in case of German need, was to desert France and leave her to her fate. The announcement is calculated to give the enthusiastic Parisians some cold chills. What has been may be again. Princes are not people to put trust in. Li Hung Chang has been censured for paying a visit to the Dowager Empress of China without observing the customary formalities. Li must learn that the rules of court etiquette are the last things an innovator should touch. They do not come within reach of civilization's influence till all else has been revolutionized. There is an idea even in Canada that the Mace helps in the process of legislation. "Fighting Joe" Martin, whom Mr. Laurier congratulated on his election for Winnipeg, is reported to have coalesced with the Patron forces and will fight the Laurier-Greenway candidates in Manitoba. Mr. Laurier's sunny smile cannot have been cathodic. Its rays have not penetrated to the heart of the Blowing Blizzard of the Prairies. Yellow may be an impervious color. Rev. Mr. Knowles, of Stewarton Presbyterian Church, speaking on the value of higher culture, advised the reading of a good daily paper by every family. The advice is worthy of being followed. The regular reading of a good daily develops intelligence, and intelligence is the basis of culture, and a lot of other good things. If the advance notices in the Government press are well based, the new Laurier tariff will raise more money by means of customs taxes without our paying it. Folks will come from far countries to see that device. It will put the perpetual motion cranks in the shade. The Mark Lane Express holds that the recent rise in the wheat market was justified by the situation. This will come as welcome news to the bulls, and when they are hungry. The Express is at once an authority and reputable. One of the sights of Manchester, as depicted in a recent newspaper illustration, shows a number of workhouse paupers taking their daily airing on the seat around Cobden's statue. Free trade didn't make them rich. It may be the Laurier-Tarte Government in the East, but out in the West they reverse the order, and with some reason. The Minister of Public Works is filling the bill, and the preeminence comes to him by right.

1896-10-31: A GREAT STORM. A Cyclone in Oklahoma and a Blizzard in Nebraska. Cottirick, Okla., October 30: A terrific rainstorm visited Oklahoma Wednesday night, being in many places a perfect water spout, and doing a great amount of damage by washouts, carrying off crops, etc. Twenty miles east of here, a cyclone devastated a section of the country one hundred yards wide and several miles long, leaving destruction and ruin in its wake. The dead, so far as their names are known, are: John McLaughlin, Mrs. John McLaughlin, M. H. Towers, and John Beabright, who were killed at the same time as Mr. and Mrs. Mullin. The residence of Abner Jones was also wrecked, and many smaller buildings were destroyed and crops ruined. The storm came at 8 o'clock from the southwest and passed to the northeast, lasting only a few minutes. It is rumored that the storm did a great amount of damage and killed a number of persons farther east in Payne County. In Lincoln County, Mr. and Mrs. John McLaughlin have been found dead in the ruins of their home, and Harrison Jones will die of his injuries.

New Orleans, October 30: A cyclone struck Lake St. Joseph, in Tensas Parish. Twelve cabins on Locust land were demolished, killing one colored woman. At Johnson's Bend, on Lake St. Joseph, the scene is one of desolation. Two colored men are killed and two colored women and a baby from Locust were drowned in Lake Bruen, where they were carried by the fury of the wind. Three barns containing corn were destroyed, and much of the corn was blown away. Six cabins were blown to pieces. Several persons were badly cut and bruised. The tenants living in the houses had their clothing and household effects blown away. Telegraph and telephone wires are down, and the public road on the Lake St. Joseph front is covered with fragments of houses, furniture, clothing, cotton, corn, and household effects.

Chicago, October 30: Last night a violent gust of wind, accompanied by a flurry of snow, struck this city. A two-story frame building on Henderson Avenue was blown from its foundations and wrecked. The inmates escaped.

Madison, Wis., October 30: A small cyclone struck Madison about 10 o'clock last night, carrying away the Opera House roof, blowing down small buildings, trees, electric wires, etc. The damage will run up into the thousands. No one is known to have been injured.

Denver, Col., October 30: Reports from Kansas and Eastern Colorado state that there is likely to be severe loss among the range cattle on account of the blizzard, which has been blowing for a day. Snow has fallen over the entire country from Olathe, Kans., and west of McCook, Neb. This had been preceded by rain that froze on the surface and then the short grass was covered by the snow, which drifted at a furious rate. Last night a general blizzard ensued, and correspondents are of the opinion that when the storm abates, many cattle will be found off their range and dead in the drifts.

Omaha, Neb., October 30: Western Nebraska is covered with ten inches of snow, thinning out as it approaches the eastern part of the state. In some sections of the state, a high wind accompanied the snow, assuming the proportions of a blizzard. Trains are delayed, and on several branches have been stuck in snowdrifts. A report from Cheyenne, Wyo., says the Overland Flyer on the Union Pacific, westbound, due there at 6:55 last night, is reported stuck in the snow between Ogallala and Big Spring, Neb.

Omaha, October 30: A tremendous snowstorm has prevailed over Western Nebraska since Wednesday night and is still raging. It is one of the greatest snowstorms in many years. A high wind prevails and the snow is drifting high, which will doubtless retard railway traffic.

Mrs. Starnaman's Cash Report.

1896-11-12: Politics, but the humor of the situation is rather dulled for Canadians by the knowledge that the facts could be many times paralleled on this side of the line during the past few months. The reported discovery of tin ore in British Columbia is interesting and may be important. Though tin is found in Spain and Portugal, Bohemia, Saxony, Australia, and the United States, the world's main supply comes from Great Britain and the Straits of Malacca. The demand is very large and is not likely to decrease. Should the newly discovered deposits be of commercial value, they are likely to yield more profit to the country than many of the gold mines that are being so much exploited. Two Liberal gentlemen with time on their hands have, it is understood, been appointed to investigate the management of the Montreal Post Office. Their acquaintance with postal matters ends with the method of extracting their mail from their letter boxes. The Chief Inspector would discover more weaknesses in a day than they will in a month. They may easily learn enough, however, to instruct the queer aggregation of non-business men that is now doing time as a government in Canada. A very heavy claim is reported to have been made for the right of using in the Post Office the stamp-cancelling machines that do their work by printing a flag on the face of the letter. The machine may be good, but as much cannot be said for the device it uses. The Union Jack is a respectable institution and worthy of better associations than are connected with a stamping machine. If the apparatus is so good that it must be had, let the design be changed. Mr. Sifton, according to a Winnipeg dispatch, is going to Brandon to submit the terms of the school agreement to a committee of the McCarthyite Liberals of that constituency. The Laurier-Tarte Government, it will be seen, has a peculiar idea of the responsibility that attaches to its negotiations with a province on a matter of national interest. It makes the respect due to Parliament secondary to the carrying of a bye-election. McKinley's correspondence is growing, and is now measured by the bushel. Most of them are begging letters. By the time he has gone through a few weeks of this sort of thing, and the White House handshaking, the President-elect may come to the conclusion that not he, but Bryan, is the really happy man. The New York World's story of the rescue of Armenian refugees from Smyrna under the guns of the United States warship Minneapolis is a very pretty story, but unfortunately it is too pretty to be true. This is the way they manage things in comic operas; in real life, they are managed otherwise. Captain Lothaire, the executioner of Charley Stokes, has been condemned to pay damages for failing to marry a Miss Vanhecke. He got off when tried for the Stokes affair. A woman's heart in Belgium would appear to be of more account than a Belfast man's neck.

Chicago, November 16 This was the warmest November day for Chicago in the history of the Weather Bureau. In the Auditorium Tower, where lake breezes blew briskly all day, the thermometer registered 70 degrees at 2 p.m., but on the streets the mercury reflected the feelings of the uncomfortable people by pointing to 73 and 74 degrees. The weather in this region has been getting gradually warmer since Saturday, yesterday being like a spring day. In Montana it was 22 degrees below zero today and blowing a blizzard. The cold in the West is coming towards Chicago steadily and freezing weather is due Wednesday. COLD SNAP COMING, and it will be accompanied by light falls of sleet or snow. Toronto, November 16, 11 p.m. A low area which was centered over Montana last night has developed into an important storm center and is now over the Upper Lake region. The pressure has greatly increased in the Northwest Territories, accompanied by a pronounced cold wave, which is quickly moving towards the lake region. The weather has been fine and mild in Ontario, and moderately cold in the Maritime Provinces. Minimum and maximum temperatures: Esquimault, 32, 40; Edmonton, 22 below, 8 below; Prince Albert, 14 below, 4; Qu'Appelle, 2, 4; Winnipeg, 8, 12; Toronto, 40, 41; Ottawa, 28, 30; Montreal, 26, 28; Quebec, 20, 20; Halifax, 38, 38.

18961127: B. Commander Bryce Would Like to Exterminate Them. Washington, D.C., November 23 An indication that the Bering Sea seal question is not at all considered settled by this Government, and that some further convention must be secured with Great Britain to supplement the insufficient regulations of the Paris tribunal, is shown in the publication of a report on the subject made by Commander Bryce, of the navy, from observations made two years ago. This officer, who is now the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, is recognized as the fur seal authority of the Government, and his report is considered of the highest significance. Commander Bryce finds that the preservation of the Alaskan seal under existing conditions and regulations rests on the very slender contingency of the prevalence of tempestuous weather during the month of August. Two or three weeks of good weather at this time, by permitting the sealers to operate without interruption outside the sixty-mile zone, and in the feeding grounds of the female seals, means the ultimate and rapid destruction of the seal herd on the Pribilof Islands. In conclusion, he writes: "The Bering Sea question, when stripped of the maze of minor points and diplomatic usages incident to its direction and adjustment, offers the following definite alternatives of settlement: 1. Shall the United States Government effectually and forever terminate this dispute by absolutely annihilating the Alaskan seal herd as the animals arrive on the seal islands? 2. Shall the United States permit the pelagic poachers of British Columbia to destroy the seals on their way to the rookeries and in the vicinity, and thus ultimately destroy the legitimate industry of killing selected seals on the islands? 3. Will the British Government enact laws to protect an industry which is now generally conceded in America to have from the outset been of more commercial interest to Great Britain than the United States? The first proposition may seem needlessly harsh and cruel, but the action indicated is, indeed, humane, and is fully warranted by the fact that no amount of protection under existing regulations is adequate to preserve the seal herd, and that the patrol of Bering Sea by American naval and revenue vessels does not prevent the havoc wrought by the pelagic hunters in killing annually 23,000 or 30,000 nursing female seals and leaving their pups to die of starvation, besides sacrificing the same number of unborn seals. No one who has had the opportunity to visit the seal islands during the breeding season and witnessed the distressing spectacle of thousands of young seals in various stages of starvation will fail to acknowledge the merciless barbarity of pelagic hunting and the humane principle involved in the proposition to wipe out the Alaskan seal herd at one blow. Sentenced for Horse Stealing. Wexford, Ont., November 26 Miles Parker was brought to the county jail this morning on his way to the Central Prison, where he will serve twelve months for horse stealing at Tilsonburg. Magistrate Hare sentenced him. Parker had been out of the Central only two months, having just served one year for the same offense. MILD TODAY, With Occasional Rains, Say the Probabilities. Toronto, November 26, 11 p.m. The storm mentioned last night has moved to Lake Superior, instead of towards the Lower Lakes, as was expected, and is now causing gales on Lakes Superior and Huron and a severe Northwestern blizzard in Manitoba. The weather today has been fine and warm over the greater part of Ontario, but in the Ottawa Valley, Quebec, and the Maritime Provinces it has continued cold, with snow and sleet. Minimum and maximum temperatures: Esquimault, 24, 28; Edmonton, 20 below, 16 below; Calgary, 8 below, 4 below; Prince Albert, 24 below, zero; Qu'Appelle, 18 below, 6 below; Port Arthur, 14, 20; Toronto, 38, 56; Montreal, 20, 32; Quebec, 16, 22; Halifax, 20, 32. Ottawa Valley: High winds; some showers, but partly fair and much milder. Upper St. Lawrence: Strong winds and gales, north and southwest; mild, with occasional rains. Lower St. Lawrence: Strong winds and gales, shifting to southward; some light flurries, but partly fair and milder.

18961128: S. Northwest St. Paul, Minn., November 27 The storm which has been raging throughout the Northwest for the past forty-eight hours is the greatest that has visited this section since the blizzard of January 12th, 1883, in which 107 lives were lost. No lives are reported lost in this storm, but there is a complete blockade of traffic in Northern Minnesota, North Dakota, and portions of South Dakota. Trains into St. Paul from the West are from five to ten hours late or abandoned altogether. It is four degrees below zero here tonight, with a terrific north wind blowing. At Moorhead, Minn., the blizzard has been on for 24 hours and there is no prospect of abatement. Traffic in the streets and all business is suspended. Nearly all passenger and freight trains are snowed in, but the Northern Pacific managed to move one passenger train tonight. The northbound passenger train on the Great Northern reached Moorhead an hour late this morning. It became stalled at the big drift right at the depot and had to be dug out. It took four powerful engines to take the four passenger coaches across the river to Fargo. The snow in some places is five feet deep. Crafton, N. TROOPS ARRIVE. Carthaginian Brings Over Drafts for Halifax and Esquimalt. Halifax, November 27 - The Allan steamer Carthaginian arrived today from Liverpool, via Queenstown and St. John's, Nfld. The steamer brought drafts for the Berkshire Regiment here, the Leicester Regiment in Bermuda, and the Engineers for Halifax and Esquimalt. It is believed that the British Government proposes to raise eleven new battalions of infantry; that a second battalion will be stationed at Halifax, and that garrisons will be sent to Esquimalt. COLDER WEATHER, With Light Local Snowfalls, Says the Probabilities. Toronto, November 27, 11 p.m. The blizzard is over in Manitoba, but the great cold continues.

Ogilvie received in Montreal nine barges of wheat yesterday and the day before. This is the last wheat for here this season. He loaded the steamer Rosemount at Fort William yesterday and is loading the steamer Bannockburn today. A private despatch from Chicago says: The wheat market is strong and there is nothing in the situation to change our opinion and advise buying on all setbacks. Calls were higher, but the offerings were not excessive. The engagement of ocean freight spot at New York on Wednesday was one 13,000-quarter steamer from Baltimore to OFO, at 3s 3d. Quote: Liverpool, 4d; London, 4(d); Glasgow, 5d; Bristol, 4d; Leith, Hull, Antwerp, and Newcastle, 5d. Sales of grain at New York for export on Wednesday were 3 loads No 1 Northern Duluth wheat, at 3Jo over December, f.o.b. afloat, and 0 load No 2 corn, at 1 Jo over December, f.o.b. afloat. The imports of French flour into England from January 1st to October 1st were 55,500 sacks, against 31,000 sacks last year. The Bulgarian wheat crop is estimated at 64,000,000 bushels, against 50,000,000 in 1895. This would give a surplus of 15,200,000 bushels for export. In speaking of the Russian wheat crop, Peerbohm recalls the fact that last year the late estimate of the Russian wheat outturn was raised to 80,000,000 bushels, but the figures published for 1895 of 370,000,000 bushels are 120,000,000 bushels larger than the figures given by the Ministry of Agriculture. In November, final reports state that the wheat crop of Victoria, harvested a few months ago, shows final results of 6,669,174 bushels on 1,412,736 acres, against 11,445,873 acres the preceding year. The rainfall on the growing crop came in time to prevent other failures, but it is considered doubtful if the result is any better than the last. The Liverpool Corn Trade News says: The official report on the crops of Belgium gives the quality of wheat as good; rye and barley good, and oats fair. Wheat has given a yield of 29.2 bushels per acre, rye 21.8, against 28.0 for wheat and 29.1 for rye in 1895. It is estimated that, reckoning the area of der wheat and rye at 1,300,000 acres, the produce of these breadstuffs has totaled some 175,000 quarters more than in 1895. The usual ridiculous estimate of requirements is given, the figure for the current season being placed at 1,200,000 quarters of breadstuffs; last season, 4,500,000 quarters net of wheat were imported. A private despatch received from Winnipeg today says: There has been a blizzard since Wednesday; weather getting colder; sleighing good; receipts of wheat very light. Cable advices to the Board of Trade this morning were as follows: Cargoes off coast, wheat and maize, nothing doing. Cargoes on passage, wheat, firm; maize, steadily held. English country markets, wheat dull. Liverpool wheat and maize, steady. Minneapolis first bakers' flour, 25s 3d. Futures, wheat steady, 6s 9d December, 6s 9d January and February, 6s 9Jd March; maize steady, 2s 11Jd November and December, 2s 1ljd January, February, and March. Paris wheat, 26 15 November, 28 20 December; flour, 46 20 November, 46 35 December. French country markets, steady. There was a sale today of 100,000 bushels of No. 1 hard Manitoba wheat made at 81 Jo afloat Fort William for milling purposes, while December wheat in Duluth today sold at 82c for No. 1 Northern. The price of No. 1 Northern is 1jc per bushel under No. 1 hard, which would cost 84c afloat Duluth, with 0 per bushel paid for floating charges. In the local grain market, business was very quiet, there being only a small demand for oats at steady prices. Peas, per 60 lb $0.61 to $0.52. No. 2 oats 0.26 to 0.26. Corn 0.00 to 0.00. Malting barley 0.46 to 0.47. Barley, feed 0.00 to 0.34. Rye 0.40 to 0.41. Buckwheat 0.36 to 0.30. There continues to be an active demand for Manitoba Hungarian patent flour on Australian account.

**NEWS FROM WINNIPEG**

A Big Blizzard - Mr. Sifton's Successor in the Manitoba Cabinet Selected (From our own correspondent) 

Winnipeg, Man., November 27 - The blizzard last night extended over almost the entire Northwest and was one of the severest forms experienced by this country in many years. The gale was furious last night, but this morning moderated, and this evening is quite spent out. Trains on all the railroads were considerably delayed, but the tracks are now clear and everything will soon be straightened out. Fortunately, throughout the storm, the temperature was quite mild, and consequently, there were no fatalities, and inconvenience was the worst of the result. With rising quotations at Chicago, wheat prices are up to top-notch figures in Manitoba. The farmer who does not get 70 cents a bushel is making a poor deal. The Hon. Mr. Sifton was to have arrived from the West tomorrow but has been delayed, and it cannot be said at all definitely when he will reach the city. The Hon. Mr. Blair, Minister of Railways, and Hon. Mr. Davies, Minister of Marine and Fisheries, will arrive from the East tomorrow. It is, therefore, doubtful whether the meeting of the four Dominion Ministers, which was occurring here more by accident than design, will take place. It is understood Messrs. Blair and Davies will go direct to the Coast, stopping at Winnipeg on the return journey. Premier Greenway today announced the selection of Chas. Mickle, member for Birtle, as Provincial Secretary, succeeding to the Cabinet vacancy caused by Hon. Mr. Sifton's retirement. Rev. Alex Grant, of Winnipeg, will accept a call to the First Baptist Church of Ottawa. The Conservatives of Saskatchewan now state positively they will run a candidate there.

**18961217: BIG SNOWSTORM**

New York Gets a Big Supply of the Beautiful and Plenty of Wind

New York, December 16 - New York City enjoys the distinction today of being the center of a big snowstorm, which has assumed the proportions of a small-sized blizzard, combined with a West Indian hurricane. It is a storm which Forecaster Dunn says is of the most dangerous kind, and one about which stories of shipwreck and loss of life at sea will be chronicled. It is blowing at the rate of 60 miles an hour at different points along the coast, and as it is going seaward, grave fears are entertained for the vessels, which are sure to run into it. There are nineteen steamers now due here from European ports. This is an unusually large list, and it contains the names of nine steamers that are from two to six days overdue, the cause being the prevailing rough weather at sea. Traffic is materially impeded by the snowfall, but no serious delays have been reported on any of the railroads. The wind blew the snow into great piles on the sidewalks of the city, and it was with much difficulty that pedestrians made their way about the town. The storm has not interfered with the telegraph wires. By noon, eight inches of snow had fallen and at 2 o'clock snow was still falling, with no signs of abatement. The velocity of the wind at that hour registered 36 miles per hour and the temperature was 24 degrees. Reports from New Jersey show that the snowstorm set in about 9:30 o'clock last night, accompanied by high winds. The crews of the life-saving stations were on duty all night and found considerable trouble in patrolling the beach, owing to the force of wind, which was over fifty miles an hour at two o'clock this morning. At Seabright, Atlantic City, Cape May, Long Branch, Asbury Park, and all the towns along the coast, it was reported that the storm was the worst in several years. At Egg Harbor City, there were snowdrifts four feet high this morning, and the meadows were flooded by the high tide. No trains could run this morning. At Cape May, there were unusually high tides which cut into many of the lanes along the ocean front. The wind blew down small outhouses and fences, and these were carried away. The storm was also very severe in Connecticut and Massachusetts.

**18961219: S Government**

Washington, December 18 - A conference between the Secretary of Agriculture and Hon. Sydney Fisher, Minister of Agriculture for the Dominion of Canada, has resulted in an agreement looking to the simplification of the livestock quarantine inspection regulations on both sides of the border. Upon his return to Canada early in January, Mr. Fisher will present the agreement for consideration in Council, and it will then be formally promulgated and go into effect. Until thus officially communicated to the Canadian Cabinet, the details of the agreement will not be made public. The present concerns the sixty days quarantine established by this country and Canada against the admission of cattle from one country to the other. Pleuro-pneumonia had been raging when the restrictions were adopted, but as there has been no recurrence of the disease on either side of the border for four years, it is deemed unnecessary to continue the present restrictions. The agreement in question, while not entirely abrogating them, simplifies the business of cattle shipment between Canada and the United States.

**A GREAT STORM**

Does Extensive Damage in the Island of Newfoundland

St. John's, Nfld., December 18 - A blizzard which has been raging here for the past two days has caused much devastation. Telegraph lines are broken and railways blocked, and all traffic impeded. There are immense snowdrifts near Holyrood, and where the railroad runs close to the seashore, an extensive washout renders the running of trains impossible. The schooner Pioneer, with a cargo of fish, is ashore at Carbonear. Her crew were two days without food, driving before the gale, before they were rescued. Other casualties are feared, but owing to the difficulty of communication, it will be impossible to learn for some days the full extent of the damage done by the storm.

Paul Gravy, Republican, who has filled for many years one of the three seats for the Department of Jura, is likely to lose his seat. Dr. Victor Louilies, Republican, who has represented a district of the Department Landes since 1888, Minister of Commerce in the Dupuy Cabinet of 1894, and Secretary of the Senate for several years, has been re-elected. Among the more prominent Senators who have been re-elected are M. Waldeck-Rousseau, who was Minister of Interior in the Cabinets of Gambetta and Ferry; M. Louis Cochery, who has held several ministerial positions, including that of Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in the Cabinet of M. Waddington; M. Fallières, Minister of the Interior in 1882, in the Cabinet of M. Duclerc; M. Ernest Boulanger, Minister of the Colonies in the Cabinet of M. Casimir-Perier; and M. Louis Davelle, also an ex-Minister. They represent districts in the Departments of Loire, Loiret, Lot-et-Garonne, and Moselle. A later despatch states that Count de Remusat, Moderate Republican, defeated his opponent in Haute Garonne on the third ballot. The vote stood 414 to 437, giving Count de Remusat a majority of 77. The Moderate Republicans claim that the defeat of M. Constance, who is a Republican, is a great victory for them.

**A GREAT BLIZZARD**

Causing Snow Up North, Floods Out West, and Cyclones South

St. Paul, Minn., January 3 - A blizzard is blowing in this section over an area 40 miles north and south and 60 miles east and west. Over Minnesota, it has been snowing for fourteen to twenty hours, and there is from seven to sixteen inches of snow on the ground. The wind is blowing a gale from the north. The snow is damp and packs so solidly on the railway tracks that it is difficult for the snow plows to work through it. The snow has also made a wreck of telegraph wires to the north and west of St. Paul. All trains are still moving, though some of them are hours late. South Dakota stations say that the storm extends as far west as the Black Hills. The temperature is... Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

From 15 to 18 degrees above zero, though at 9 o'clock it was rapidly growing colder. The tie will be suffering among livestock if the mercury drops to zero. St. Louis, Mo., January 3. The severest rainstorm of recent years has prevailed throughout Missouri, Northern Arkansas, and Indian Territory during the past 36 hours. In many places in Western Missouri the streams are overflowed, and in some places railroads have suffered from washouts. Last night the rain turned to sleet, and today a furious snowstorm is raging. The temperature has fallen 40 degrees in Missouri and Eastern Kansas in the last 24 hours, and in the latter section a genuine blizzard is sweeping over the country. At Bunnell, Mo., the Osage River has risen 15 feet, and Warsaw reports a rise of 22 feet and a repetition of last winter's flood feared. At Osceola the river is out of its banks, and some low lands are submerged. At Fayette the electric light power house is flooded, and the city is in darkness tonight. In the vicinity of Sedalia, every stream is reported out of its banks. At La Grange and Knobnoster a small cyclone prevailed last night, many trees being uprooted, but no large damage to property has been reported so far. Webb City reports heavy damage to property by rain and wind. Clinton, Warrensburg, and Shelbyville suffered serious damage from the downpour. In many places in Western Missouri, the mercury has fallen almost to zero, and this drop in temperature will probably result in checking the flood. 

Shreveport, La., January 3. A cyclone from the southwest struck and almost literally demolished the town of Mooringsport, just north of this city, at 3:45 p.m. yesterday. Over twenty dwellings were blown down, only seven buildings being left intact. Four persons were killed and twenty injured. 

Eckton, Ark., January 5. At 8:40 last night a cyclone struck this town, destroying nearly every building in South Benton, and passed on in a northeasterly direction, wrecking every building in its path. In an out-house near the depot, a tramp was killed. Many families are left without homes. Freight cars on the siding at the depot were turned over, and a wrecking crew has been at work all day clearing the tracks.

January 5: V Hutchings, a defeated candidate, Mr. McCreary will enter a counter suit to disfranchise Mr. Hutchings on the ground of corruption during the election. George Anderson, the horseman, was charged with soliciting and inciting deputy returning officers to stuff ballot boxes at the Winnipeg election, and was today sent up for trial. Major McGillivray, of North Ontario, passed through here yesterday to visit the Foresters' courts in British Columbia. The Major said he would visit Rossland, and it is likely there is some gold mining as well as forestry in his trip. 

To Henn Royal, son of Hon. John Royal, is the Conservative candidate for the Manitoba Legislature for St. Boniface, which seat has been resigned by Mr. Prendergast. Blizzards and snowstorms are badly demoralizing the train service. The trains to the Great Northern and Northern Pacific today are all cancelled. The C.K. trains are late, but are getting through. The blizzard is most severe in the south, through Dakota and Minnesota.

January 6: THE INDIAN PLAGUE. The panic is increasing - Police flee from the city. London, January 5. The Daily Mail will tomorrow publish a dispatch from Bombay saying that the panic there arising from the plague has spread to the police, many of whom have abandoned their duties and sought safety in flight. Much valuable property is thus left unguarded. 

Caught in the Blizzard. Fargo, N.D., January 5. News has just reached Fargo of the death of Edward and John Pettit in the blizzard of Sunday. They were caught not far from their home at Hunter, twenty miles from this city, and frozen to death. 

LEADING CONTENTS TODAY: The City bill passed in the Legislative Council, Newfoundland, was recorded reciprocity with the United States. The tariff inquiry. The suicide of Cornelius. Sir Charles Tupper banqueted in London. The Pacific Cable conference.

January 25: C., January 23. Lome Fletcher, the Minnesota member of the House Committee on Commerce, has received notification that Bradford O. Church, of Duluth, President of the Head of the Lakes Millers' Association, and Charles A. Pillsbury, representing the millers of Minneapolis, will advocate on Tuesday at the public hearing the amendment to the third section of the Interstate Commerce Bill regulating interchange of traffic between railroads. The effect of the amendment, according to Mr. Pillsbury, will be to permit a man to do what he likes with his own and enable shippers to choose their terminals, and thus avoid parasites in the shape of lighterage attachment that rob the miller of his profit. Among the statements received by Mr. Fletcher is one that out of $20 a car freighting on wheat from Buffalo to New York, $18 has been paid out to a Lighterage Company, leaving $1 for the railroad shareholders for a 50-mile haul. The Memphis Chamber of Commerce has passed resolutions in favor of the amendment, and Rudolph Fink, of the Memphis & Little Rock Railroad, strongly urges the leaders of the delegation to vote for this amendment. 

Chicago, January 23. It is obligatory for all the leading markets to harden a little on account of a cold wave or a blizzard, which may affect growing crops and disturb the movement of the wheat, and as a rule increase the consumption in many quarters. This was the chief cause of strength in all directions on 'Change this morning. Wheat was advanced early to 80c. There was a disposition on the part of the traders to cover, but sales on the slight advance soon satisfied the demand, which was entirely local. For the entire morning up to 11 o'clock, wheat made a little less than a 1c gain over the Friday closing. The opening price for May was 79c, and the best point touched on early wires was 80c. July was advanced to 79c. The first noticeable feature was the buying of considerable wheat for New York account. Many people who were willing to risk opinions, but not cash, were talking the market up. The short Saturday session no doubt caused many to await the first of next week to take hold on the buying side. The Monday news will be worth waiting for: the final official figures on the 1896 crop, the visible supply, and possible changes in the weather by that time. The feeling in financial circles has improved for the week. Wall Street is confident of a further improvement in stocks. The cold wave which swept over the whole wheat country last night gave the tide more snap on the buying side. The Eastern commercial reports were encouraging to holders. Shorts were the principal buyers. At over 80c for May, many people stand ready to sell, and this supplied shorts and checked the advance. Near the close, prices held at 80c and nothing doing in the pit. 

Chicago, January 23. The wheat market was stupidly dull, but firm today. Operations were confined mainly to covering by local shorts. Corn and oats were dull. Put options were moderate and confined almost exclusively to the transactions of local traders. Estimated receipts for Monday: Wheat, 53 cars; oats, 23 cars; corn, 205 cars. Freights: Nothing doing. The leading futures closed: Wheat, No. 2 January, 78c; May, 80c; July, 75c. Corn, No. 2, January, 22c; May, 24c; July, 25c; September, 26c. Oats, No. 2 January, 15c; July, 18c.

New York, January 24. A London special cable to the Sun says: All London is of the opinion that the weather is the most important matter of human interest today. Since noon yesterday there have been several brisk flurries of snow, with the result that there is a thin blanket averaging an inch in thickness in the parks and gardens of the metropolis. This is so extraordinary in London that the newspapers describe it as a blizzard, and everybody is talking about the terrible snowstorm. Sensational telegrams from all parts of Great Britain describe in vivid language the ravages of the storm. The most startling dispatch of all comes from a point in the far north of Scotland, where a rash correspondent affirms that the snow lies six inches deep on a level, leading credulous Londoners to accept such statements only. Here is the corrected text:

with a grain of salt. It is more than five years since snow has been seen in London in its present quantities, and its appearance is regarded as in the nature of a phenomenon. It has, indeed, worked a wonderful transformation of the blackest, gloomiest city in all the world. London architects, even in the brightest weather, wear a universal hue of shades and charcoal. Its most famous buildings are dressed in perpetual mourning. Now, in spite of the lowering skies, the city has put on gala attire. The solemn old town is almost gay. Even as I write, the clouds have suddenly broken and a flood of rosy light is bathing the great dome of St. Paul's in wonderful splendor. It is no longer a black, imposing silhouette against the sky, but a great, pink, glowing dome, which seems to shine with an incandescence all its own. 

A special cable from Paris to the World says: Most unusual weather prevails in Paris. Snow falls in thick showers, then comes bright sunshine like May or June, only, however, to last for a tantalizing five minutes. Great black clouds loom up again, and down comes the snow again and the thermometer remains about 48 degrees Fahrenheit. The streets are full of chocolate, cream-colored slush, and toward evening, when it begins to freeze, the cab horses slip about and tumble, breaking the shafts as they fall. This mixture of snow, sunshine, and drizzle has lasted forty-eight hours, and there is no sign yet of its letting up.

**Objecting to the Conscription Law**  
Advices from Belgium show a serious state of affairs there, arising from the conscription law, which provides that every man who has completed his 19th year is liable to military duty for eight years, of which, however, two-thirds are allowed, as a rule, on indemnity. An important clause of the law provides that a conscript may purchase a substitute, and it is this clause that causes the trouble. Wealthy young men are able to purchase exemption, which they do in large numbers, by getting substitutes, and thus, practically speaking, the whole military service of the country falls upon those who are the least qualified by their domestic duties to perform it. Great discontent prevails against the system which takes young men from their employment, and it is anticipated that trouble will follow the drawing of 1897 conscripts in February. The Government has received information that an organized resistance is being prepared in which the radicals, who include a very large proportion of the workingmen of the country, are taking a most active part. The young men liable to the conscription are resolved not to serve, and all the labor leagues have promised to back them up in their resistance to the Government. Already military preparations have been made to meet the trouble.

**New Chinese Minister**  
The new Chinese Minister to England, Li Feng Lo, is expected to arrive in London early in June. He brings some magnificent presents to the Queen, at whose demand jubilee fêtes he is to figure. The Foreign Office, which has never got on well with the present Chinese Minister, expects to find in Li Feng Lo a better medium of communication with Peking. He knows English, French, and German, was Li Hung Chang's interpreter at Tientsin, and subsequently Li's Minister of the Navy, and accompanied Li on his recent visit to the continent and England. Li Feng Lo is credited with a strong preference for English-built warships and is said to have almost carte blanche in the disposal of Chinese money for English building yards. 

Advices from Tientsin state that Sheng, the new Tsungli Yamen (Foreign Office) director of telegraphs and railways, is favoring with his support the American syndicate with which Mr. Huntington is connected. Sheng's influence is already great. He is spoken of as the coming man, who will eventually take control of affairs touching foreign interests, the place now held by Li Hung Chang. He backs the American syndicate for the construction of the railway between Hankow and Peking.

**Lady Scott**  
The consideration with which Lady Scott, who was recently sentenced to eight months' imprisonment for libeling her son-in-law, Earl Russell, is treated in Holloway Prison finds adverse criticism even in fashionable circles. The last titled lady sent to Holloway was the Duchess of Sutherland, now Lady Eoth. But hers was not a criminal case, the offense being contempt of court. A strong opinion now prevails in society that Lady Scott has been too leniently dealt with. The tide has turned toward Earl Russell. Lady Scott's imprisonment is attended with amenities, such as were accorded to the Duchess of Sutherland. Two rooms have been specially furnished for her by her son-in-law, Dick Russell, who paid the costs of the trial. Her wine and food, papers and books are supplied from outside. A specially-paid matron waits upon her. Lady Scott will shortly plead that her health is breaking down from the confinement, but if public opinion is regarded, the Home Office will require the full term to be served.

**News and Personal**  
It is stated to be impossible for the Duke and Duchess of York to visit Canada in 1897, owing to the condition of the health of the Duchess. She will be unable to travel before autumn. Hon. Richard Dobell has started for Ottawa. The Chronicle says Mr. Dobell, while in England, has had exceptional opportunities of making known in official and commercial circles the earnest desire of the Laurier Ministry to cooperate in every way to establish an era of goodwill in Anglo-American relations. Chief Justice Strong of Canada will be sworn in as a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on his arrival in London. Hitherto the Colonial Bench has not been represented in the Judicial Committee. This notable innovation occurs under an act named by the Robbery Government. Besides Chief Justice Strong, Chief Justice...

**JACK FROST'S GRASP Causes Intense Suffering**  
In Chicago and St. Louis. 

**APPEAL FOR ASSISTANCE**  
Made by the Mayor of Chicago - Wants $100,000 - Suffering in St. Louis - At Canadian Points. 

Chicago, January 25. The people of Chicago were aroused today to take prompt and generous action for the relief of the two score thousand destitute inhabitants, whose suffering for want of fuel, food, and clothing had reached an extreme stage, as a result of the terrible cold wave which came upon the city Saturday, increasing in intensity until today, when the temperature reached the lowest point officially recorded in a quarter of a century. Between five and seven o'clock, the thermometer at the Weather Bureau in the Auditorium tower, where it was warmer than in the street, recorded 20 degrees below zero. Only once in the history of the Bureau - December 24th, 1872, - has the temperature fallen lower. From 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. there was a gradual rise, the range being 18 to 22 degrees, but the relief was hardly felt when accompanied by a cutting wind from the northwest. The highest temperature today was 10 below zero, and tonight the mercury is moving slowly down again with no hopes of material relief held out for tomorrow. Mayor Swift issued a proclamation this afternoon appealing in urgent language to all citizens who have the means to spare to contribute at once money and supplies to prevent the starvation and freezing of unfortunate thousands. He urged the subscription of $100,000 as being too much to afford the help needed. The funds of the charity organizations have become depleted owing to the extreme demands made upon them even during the mild weather that had prevailed here until a few days ago. The Chicago Relief and Aid Society was compelled to make a special appeal for money last week to carry on its work, because of the unusually large number of heads and supporters of families who are unemployed. Before the Mayor's proclamation was issued, contributions to the special fund came pouring into his office in currency and cheques, while offers of provisions, clothing, coal, and wood were received on a liberal scale. The Board of Trade and other organizations started to raise a relief fund, and the churches and Salvation Army began making systematic and extensive arrangements to help in the charitable work along their special lines. Soup houses and shelters will be established and maintained as long as necessary. The city will buy with the special fund food and fuel, and distribute them on demand through the agency of the police department. This relief is to be afforded without the usual investigation until the regular charitable organizations are able to take up the work. All police stations have been thrown open to the homeless, and tonight everyone was crowded with refugees from the freezing air. The Mayor's proclamation is the first of the kind to be issued in 25 years. The worst and most numerous cases of suffering were reported from South Chicago and Kensington, where thousands of men have been laid off at the steel mills and other establishments. The work of affording not temporary relief was pushed by the police agents using patrol wagons and ambulances in such a systematic manner that no case of destitution reported remained unattended to tonight.

**Suffering in St. Louis**  
St. Louis, January 25. The cold wave which gathered in British Columbia on Friday swept down upon this section yesterday and still continues here, though slightly abated tonight. At seven o'clock this morning the temperature was exactly zero. At noon, 3 above was indicated, and at 6 p.m. four degrees above was the reading. This extreme low temperature followed sharply upon a long season of mild weather and found the condition of the people unprepared. The demand upon the Associated Charities for food and fuel was never greater. When the ticket window of the Provident Association opened at 6 a.m., 300 men and women were in line waiting for assistance. The police department is doing everything possible to relieve the distress. Twenty-five frost-bitten victims were treated at the City Dispensary today and three amputations were necessary. Hundreds of homeless people are sheltered tonight at the police stations. The river has not yet closed here though it is full of floating ice, which endangers shipping. Trains from points west and south were late tonight. All were delayed by snow blockades. Special dispatches show that no section west or south of this city has escaped the sudden fury of the blizzard. For the first time ever known, ice formed for a short time over Lower White River in Arkansas today. Snow is reported in West Tennessee and Southern Illinois. The great fruit section of Southwest Missouri and Northern Arkansas has suffered severely and nothing can save the crops. A fall of snow that would have saved the wheat fields of Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska did not come with the cold wave, and predictions of disaster to the cereals were frequent on 'Change.

Washington, January 25. The mercury here stood at 12 at midnight tonight. Ernest Southern, a white man, was frozen to death on the street in the southwestern part of the city.

**At Canadian Points**  
Quebec, January 25. The thermometer marked 28 below zero here this morning. There is a sharp wind up, and the cold is more penetrating than that of the cold spell of last week. 

Ottawa, January 25. The past twenty-four hours have been the coldest in 1897 or this winter. At midnight last night at Rideau Hall, the thermometer registered 20 degrees below zero. At 6 a.m. this morning it stood at 21 degrees below. On Parliament Hill at midnight it was 24 degrees below, and at 6 a.m. in the same place it stood at 26 degrees below. At 9 o'clock this morning it had only risen five degrees.

Winnipeg, January 25. Cold weather extends over the entire Canadian Northwest, but as it is really the first extreme cold snap of the season, there is not much cause for complaint. The stock on the ranches is in good condition and well prepared for a cold spell. A dispatch from Pilot Mound, Southern Manitoba, today, says: Wm. Tisdale, living in the dry settlement, 14 miles north of this place, is reported missing since the storm of Thursday. He had been at Manopolis and started to walk home. After walking about two miles he took shelter at Mr. Dell Stevens, where it... Here is the corrected text:

---

He was found; he had been more or less frozen. Mr. Stevens insisted on Mr. Tisdale remaining all night, but while Mr. Stevens was out attending to his stock, Mr. Tisdale started out for his home, fully four miles distant. He has never been seen since. Search parties are still looking for his body. 

**Law Is All Right**  
Washington, January 22. That part of the shipping law of the United States that allows the arrest of sailors who refuse to observe the terms of their contracts to serve on board vessels was today declared by the Supreme Court to be constitutional and within the jurisdiction of State Courts to enforce. If saving twenty percent on the purchase of high-class MEN'S FURNISHINGS interests you, step into one of Tooke's stores and see the value we are offering. Regular prices are plainly marked on the goods. Just deduct 20 percent, and that is what the price is now.

**18970203: BRITISH LIVE STOCK**  
Better Prices Noted - Manchester Expectations. From our own correspondent. Liverpool, January 23. With more or less of a blizzard, as the papers are reporting, the two or three degrees of frost sell the wild Rochdale wind prevalent. During the past twenty-four hours, our meat salesmen have been shaking hands with themselves, and looking forward to prices that have only been known to them of late in dreams. What a sanguine, hopeful lot they are, to be sure! Markets are better all over the country; this is evident, but I do not think the occurrences which have induced this state of affairs are very permanent. To begin with, the dealers of stock have had an open winter and plenty of fodder up to now, and consequently held on to their stock. Direct Canadian supplies finished off at the beginning of December. States shipments since have been more or less restricted. Argentines, ditto; result limited; effecting both native and foreign cattle and sheep. An advance in values, well, as in steers, cattle, say to $1 and on sheep firm 60c to 75c, but only the very best of either. Two weeks hence we shall receive later receipts from all United States ports; the first touch of winter will force many feeders to market their stock early, and then oversupplies and lack of demand will come into play. Thus hath it been in the past, and from the dead past let my Canadian friends gain some living experience, especially from Millar, Port Laird, and Boston.

**MANCHESTER AND A DIRECT CATTLE TRADE**  
The Lord Mayor of Liverpool presiding at the annual dinner of the Butchers' Association this week made some very pointed references to the designs of Manchester on the cattle and meat trade from Canada and the States. Although it had entirely gone across the water to Birkenhead, he said, the Corporation of Liverpool were not at all jealous; but they were decidedly opposed to its getting up the water via Manchester. He had been interested to know that although the civic authorities of Cottonopolis had spent over £100,000 to foster a direct cattle trade, yet only three cargoes had found their way to the unknown regions of Mode Wheel. The tolls upon these cargoes would about meet the expenses of the lading for one week. Whatever other trades had done, very little of the cattle trade had been taken from the port of Liverpool to the port of Manchester. The efforts of Manchester to encourage the trans-Atlantic cattle trade were not likely to do much more successfully in the future than they had met with in the past, for the tendency of the trade was to produce larger steamers, and larger steamers could not possibly go up to Manchester, but only to places like Liverpool. It was in those larger steamers that the cattle trade of the world would be done. That being so, they might fairly say that Liverpool was likely to be as well supported in the future as in the past. He was proud of the civic patriotism of the men in the meat and cattle trade who felt it their duty to try and keep their trade in the old channel for the good of the old city of Liverpool.

**LONDON PRICES**  
Monday's supply was 1,330 beasts. From the United States came 1,230, and from South America 100. The colder weather, combined with the small number of offers, stimulated trade, and an advance of from 2d to 3d per 8 lb has to be recorded. A quick clearance was made. The best States beasts on offer made 4s per 8 lb. Argentines quoted at 3s 6d to 3s 8d. Sheep totaled 970, or 110 less than the previous Monday, and consisted entirely of shipments from the Argentine. Trade was dull, best prices making 3s 8d per 8 lb. On Thursday there were 736 cattle forward: 616 States and 120 Argentines. Consequently, business was a bit brisker than usual, and an early clearance was effected, but no advance can be reported on Monday's rates. A few picked American beasts probably made all of 4s 1d (12.1c), but 4s (12c) was the general top current rate. Secondary and middling sorts, 2s 8d to 3s 10d (11c to 12.5c). South American cattle participated in the advance and sold well (quality considered) at 3s 6d to 3s 8d (10c to 11c). In the sheep pens, there were 678 Argentines and 446 States. Trade ruled firm, but not as firm for cattle. However, a good clearance was made at prices to equal 12 per lb. Home States lambs made up to 15s, so the buyers averred, but they were worth it this time of year.

**LIVERPOOL AND BIRKENHEAD**  
At Stanley on Monday there was a much larger supply of cattle, and prime quality met a good demand at last rates. Other sorts, however, slow and lower. Sheep were also in larger numbers, but the demand was slow and prices lower all round. Beef, 6d to 8d per lb; Scotch mutton, 8½d to 6d; Irish, 7½d to 8d. The numbers marketed were 1,834 cattle, and 4,089 sheep. At the foreign fairs, trade ruled fairly firm, the colder weather helping sellers right along. The actual advance in values, however, has not been very great as the supplies were rather in excess of demand. Country buyers have not been operating very freely as the offerings at the chief distributing markets have been liberal enough to prompt many dealers to stay away from Birkenhead. At present writing, the best beef is not making more than a small fraction over 10s per lb (say 6 1/16d), really good to choice bodies selling at 3s 4d per stone (10c per lb). Coarser descriptions are selling better (they always do when we get a touch of frost) at prices ranging from 3s 1d (7½c) to 4d (9c). London buyers, the principal operators, went in mostly for the choice, but the secondary grades were good enough and cheap enough to be taken by provincial salesmen at a small advance. The sheep trade keeps pretty firm, some Al American making very close on 12s (6d), while a few picked lambs are reported to have made as much as 13s (6½d). For next week we have about 4,600 cattle in sight and nearly 6,000 sheep. Sellers are looking forward to better prices being made, as the cold weather, which seems to have come with every prospect of staying, is bound to create a good demand. But what run of weather can we rely on in this country?

**CLASHOW YORKSHIRE**  
At the Monday sale of States cattle there were in the sheds 408 animals, ex Sarmatian, from New York; 386, ex Cppim, from Boston; 405, ex Scandinavian, from Boston, and 345, ex Tritonia, from Baltimore—a total available supply of 1,691. There were no Canadians presented a year ago. There was a large and representative attendance of purchasers, both local and from a distance. The cattle consisted principally of bullocks, but there were also a few oxen and heifers included in the various lots, while there was about the usual percentage of bulls sold in the bytes. As regards quality, the cattle were fully up to the average standard presented here, the bulk of them being shown in excellent condition, while they were of a well-tubed class, and most suitable for the requirements of the trade. The remainder were animals of a heavier tone with a few beasts which scarcely showed so well while being passed through the ring. Trade during the sale was similar to that experienced last week, the high currency level being well maintained. Small, neat bullocks of the best sort were in most request and met a keen competition, the bidding at times being of an animated description. Heavy prime beasts met a good selling trade at slightly lower rates, while plainer and secondary animals moved off steadily, no difficulty being experienced in cashing them. Bulls were also in good demand, the market for them being somewhat similar to that for bullocks, anything of a choice character being wanted and eagerly competed for, and in consequence former values were easily sustained. The approximate deadweight quotations may be given as follows: Bullocks, best quality medium weights up to 68s per cwt; heavy prime 64s to 66s; and current, 52 to 54s per cwt. Bulls realized from 44s to 49s per cwt, according to the quality and finish. At the conclusion of the sale, there were about 400 of the Scandinavian cattle held over till next week, the supply being rather short.

**18970206:** M. Remusat, who received a larger vote at the time of the polling than M. Constant, has died since the election, and the seat was accordingly given to M. Clist. 

**LONDON, February 5.** A special to the Standard from Paris says: "Two sergeants and four privates connected with the Alpine Chasseurs in charge of the mail between Sees and Mont Valensen, lost in the recent blizzard, are supposed to have perished in the line of duty during the storm." 

Paris, February 5. The Echo de Paris says that fighting has occurred on the frontier of Siam between the French and the Siamese. 

London, February 5. A Standard special from Paris announces that the judgment in the case of the Princess de Wrede, a noted amateur singer, upholds the validity in France of the Munich decree, annulling the marriage of Prince de Wrede with Mme. Maldaner, and that she has, therefore, lost her case. A special dispatch from Paris, dated December 3rd, said that a sensation was caused there by an action for divorce commenced by Princess de Wrede against her husband, Prince Adolphe de Wrede. It was also reported that Prince Adolphe recently went through the form of marriage with an American heiress at Geneva, Switzerland. 

London, February 5. The Chinese Government recently requested the British Government to loan to it a British naval officer to assist in the reorganization of the Chinese Navy, which was practically wiped out of existence by the Japanese during the recent war. Great Britain has acceded to the request, and has selected for the position Commander Charles H. Dundas, who is at present attached to the battleship Repulse. 

**Celebrating the Victory**  
Orillia, Ont., February 6. The Conservatives of Orillia are tonight celebrating their victory of yesterday. Mr. Bennett came in from Midland this evening and was met at the station by a large number of the rank and file in carriages, and was driven to the Orillia House. After supper, a procession was formed.

SPORTS AND PASTIMES (Continued from Fifth Page)

THE LONG The Big Fight, New York, March 6 A Carson special says: The storm that started yesterday did not do a thing to the pugs in training. As a storm, it might have been classed as a toe-curling affair without following it up with a heavy fall of snow, but the chilly breath of the Sierra peaks makes it more unwelcome. This knocked out Corbett's new venture in the fashion of road work and made the sandy highway about Carson like the trails through polar regions. All this, too, a week after the natives had declared that winter was a thing of the past, to be laid away and forgotten as a matter of record only at the severest season ever known in this region. Not for a minute did the snow let up, and by daylight the ground was six inches under the surface with more coming. It is believed that this snow will disappear quickly, as there is nothing in it of the same character as the blizzard of two days ago. The temperature is much higher, and weather experts predict a hard three days' thaw to follow, which will remove all trace of the storm. The sun began business early this morning, and for once the weather experts were looked upon as people whose word might be accepted. Fitzsimmons has been giving three-minute rounds at the bag to each of several punches. For instance, he would give the bag a whirl of successive left swings, rest a minute, then jab it for three more, and so on. News of this method of procedure has come to Jim Corbett's ears, and he started to discount it. Corbett delivered left hooks on the bag for ten minutes without an interval. They were left hooks for fair, too, and frequently were triple blows, allowing the bag no time to recover its swing between any two of the time. Corbett practices some favorite blows, notably a hard straight right following a light left lead, and kept at the bag for twenty minutes longer. In the gymnasium, he flipped to his flannels and sweater and invited Jeffries to go at him. Jeffries was willing, but at every vicious lead was met with a straightening jab that shook and jarred the men's sensibilities into chaos. He was susceptible to a knockout at any time during the first three minutes. Edgar came next, and defeating counters was wary. In a mix-up, Corbett sent him reeling with a left hook and apologized. Charley White's call of time was welcome, although Corbett had been more than merciful. Masey next tried to twist his opponent's head off in clinching tactics and was made to back and give ground across the handball court, the second time landing with his head against the pineboards. Billy Wools then had a three-minute bout. This program was repeated four times, Corbett taking absolutely no rest and giving each man nine minutes between rounds. Corbett likes the change in method recommended by his trainers and seems none the worse for his two days of rest. He has lost no speed, and all danger of his good state has been obviated. If necessary, he will be given another let-up before the fight. Fitz nearly cracked Roeber's skull in practice. He is in line, too, with the medical examination fad. He has been prodded and thumped by a physician. No traces of acute dipsomania were revealed, and while the doctor did not call him "the most perfectly developed athlete he had ever seen," the diagnosis was of such a nature as to assure the public the men are fit to slug each other without serious injury. Doctor Gulnan, who made the examination, when he concluded, said: "I am not in the habit of examining fighters, and I am not the man to say whether they are in what is called fighting condition. They are, however, in as good shape as it is possible for two human animals to be." There is probably no betting here, as most of the betting men are holding off until the week of the fight before putting up cash. Julian says that he will call Bon off early next week and make him do some loafing for the last week. He will allow him to do nothing but such work as club-swinging and moderate walks. Corbett, too, will let up on the most vigorous exercising next week. He will do just enough to keep his wind and muscles in trim and expects to fill out some before he responds to the clang of the timer's bell.

LOOKING OUT FOR REWARDS, San Francisco, March 6

18970325: I. Doty, 1611 Blake Street, Denver, Col., who will take charge of Colorado, Wyoming, and temporarily of Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Indian Territory. Herbert W. Foltz, Indianapolis, who will take charge of Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. The Chairman will take charge of the balance of the territory until President Potter completes his appointments. When the board is complete, districts will be reassigned to each by the Chairman. The following letter explains itself and is published for the information of racing men generally: 

Mr. Frederick J. Titus, New York, 

"Dear Sir, Your very courteous letter, dated February 15, is received. Your suspension is removed in accordance with the recommendation of the National Assembly, which is considered an instruction. The date set by the motion is March 15. You are in the amateur class from that date. The most that has been claimed in extenuation of your offense is that in your generosity you proposed to permit a friend to win a race at St. Louis because it was his home. That generosity was misdirected. You have no doubt since reflected upon this matter, as you intimate, and have come to the conclusion that such generosity would naturally be reciprocated, and that would involve serious consequences to the grand spirit we are all interested in. The sequence would be that in some of the largest cities in the country, spectators would be inveigled on false pretenses into paying admission to see some races which were not competed for and were not won on the merits of the contestants. In that case, the occupation of the racing men would soon be gone. It would not be wise for any racing man to believe that he would receive such clemency again from the National Assembly in a similar case. 

Sincerely wishing you all the artistic success during the coming season which your well-known abilities merit, I am very respectfully, 

Albert Mott, 

Chairman Racing Board, 

Baltimore, March 15, 1897 

The Scramble for Office (Leslie's Weekly) 

Whenever there is a change of administration in Washington, an army of hungry office-seekers assembles there, and the scramble for office is amusing or pitiful, accordingly as we look upon it. Some professional commentators on public happenings say that this office-seeking is a part of the American system, and being American, it is all right and proper. As a matter of fact, there is nothing peculiarly American about it; indeed, the custom is as old as government itself, and it has flourished most extensively and most perniciously in those monarchies where courts were most corrupt. We are not of those who believe that the political millennium is to be attained through the extension of the civil service regulations so that every governmental office must be bestowed after an examination fashioned on academic lines, but we are persuaded that such a method is at once better and more dignified than that which now prevails, and through which loud insistence counts for more than genuine worth. The President of the United States is selected for other work than parcelling out the spoils of victory. To him, the country looks for its statesmanship in internal affairs and foreign relations as well; in him are reposed our national credit and our national honor. How can he attend to these things when all his days are taken up with these persistent office-seekers? It is a pity that a rule like this could not be applied: the first shall be last, and to him who comes not at all shall be the prize. 

Profits on School Books (Mail and Umpire) 

The debate on the educational estimates has brought out some peculiar facts. It seems that textbook making is a very profitable occupation. The Minister has it in his power to authorize just such books as he pleases and can therefore distribute the profits at will. The reader monopoly is an excellent franchise. Dr. Byerson has secured the figures, which show that Part I of the first book costs 3 cents and sells for 10 cents; Part II costs 4 cents and sells for 15 cents. The second reader costs 91 cents to produce and sells at 25 cents; the third costs 12 cents and sells at 40, and the fourth costs 14 cents and sells at 50. 

Family Burned to Death 

Nashville, Tenn., March 24 The house of Jacob Ade, a German farmer, was partly burned at Paradise Ridge last night, and in the ashes were found the charred remains of his wife, his daughter Lizzie, aged 14, and the ten-year-old daughter of Henry Moiref, a neighbor, who was spending the night with the Ades. Henry Ade, a ten-year-old boy, is missing. The deed is supposed to have been the work of tramps, who have lately been numerous in the locality. 

Chicago Storm Struck 

Chicago, March 24 A severe storm struck Chicago yesterday, accompanied by snow and high wind. At midnight, the storm had assumed the proportions of a blizzard. Railroad and streetcar service was seriously interfered with. The storm was general throughout the northern part of Illinois and portions of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota.

18970413: HEBS 2230 St. Gaul's Gilo: 4232 St. Louis. REFRESHING COMEDY presented by a Strong Company at the Queen's Theatre. KEARNEY IN THE CANUCK. At the Theatre Francais. Melodrama at the Royal - My Friend From India. Returning: There was a good audience at the Queen's Theatre last night, and it may justly be said that no one went away disappointed; everybody enjoyed "Dodge at the French Ball." It is one of those pieces that is vim and go all the way through; it is a musical comedy of a type that is calculated to chase away ennui; it is a production that puts each one in high good humor, its brightness and sprightliness of their very nature producing an infection that the audience is only too willing to catch, and of which there is a feeling that it would gladly have more. Indeed, last night the audience did have more than the original lines contained, for they would not rest contented until some of the songs, choruses, etc., had been repeated! The plot turns upon the complicated and at times embarrassing situations that arise out of the fact that Mr. Dodge has practiced a little deception upon his wife by attending a masked French ball without her knowledge and topped with a lady other than her whom he promised to love and cherish. As may readily be conceived, this affords groundwork for almost innumerable laughable incidents, and it has been well taken advantage of. The comedy consists of three acts, the first and last of which may be said to have the most direct connection with Mr. Dodge and his ball escapade, the second act, by a mere thread of connection so far as the plot goes, being devoted to vaudeville. This relieves to some extent the great amount of fun-making that predominates in the other two acts, while the vaudeville itself is of a very high class, the several turns, no matter whether choruses, dances, songs or duets, being given with a finish that is exceptional. The comedy is given by the Henahaw-Tew Brock Company, and it is a decidedly strong combination. The bulk of the fun-making, of course, falls upon the shoulders of the gentleman who interprets the role of Mr. Dodge, president of the Montquitoville Bank, and in this instance it is Mr. John E. Leoshaw, whose acting is marked by a naturalness, both of manner and facial expression, that is perfectly charming. He plays his part without appearing in any way to force the slightest point, and in that lies much of the charm of his acting. He is well supported by Mr. Frank David, who sustains the character of Barnaby Potter, Mr. Dodge's confidential clerk. Of him it may be said that he possesses great ease of manner and never misses a point. Mr. William Blaisdell, with whom Montrealers have been acquainted in the past, is with the company, and his reception was all that he could ever desire. To him is allotted the role of Alphonse d'Arville, waiter in a French restaurant, and he interprets it with that ability which has ever characterized his work. As Zenobia Dodge, wife of the gentleman who is responsible for all the trouble, May Ten Bloeck gives an admirable presentation of the part, and Miss Carlotta depicts Harriet Pelham, Mrs. Dodge's unmarried sister, with ability, whilst as Mackenzie, Mrs. Dodge's maid, Clara Lavine endows the part with all the vivacity and artfulness for which it calls. McKee Rankin's play "The Canuck" was played at the Theatre Francais yesterday by the stock company to good houses. The author, in his palmy days, made great fame (being a Canadian himself) in the delineation of L'Habitant, and in the character of Jean Baptiste Cadeaux scored an unqualified success. The play being of local interest it was naturally expected that Mr. Alex Kearney, who personates the leading role this week, would receive a rousing reception, being a Montrealer himself, and he did. Mr. Kearney appears to have made a thorough study of the part, and somewhat astonished his friends by the excellence with which he portrayed the French Canadian dialect. He cited and played the part to perfection, and in the scene where his erring daughter returns to her home and begs his forgiveness, he was applauded to the echo. Mr. Kearney appears to have a proper conception of the part and at once sinks his personality in the delineation of the French habitant. Mr. Kearney, Mr. John E. Henshaw has ably assisted by Miss Beryl Hope, who took the part of Archange (his daughter) most acceptably, and won the deserved plaudits of the audience. Mr. Walter B. Aytodall, as Cyrus Stebbins, played the part to perfection, and showed that he was a diligent student. Mr. Alexander Gaden as the villain of the piece, and in the scene where he attempts to burglarize the premises of Jean Baptiste was very effective. The play is well mounted, the scenery is appropriate, and "The Canuck" is an assured success for the balance of the week. The vaudeville, as usual, is up to date, and is headed by Mr. Walter J. Talbot, described as a descriptive tenor, who sings some ballads well. Adeline Marden has a good voice, if a little harsh, and warbles some operatic airs in a fairly finished manner. Hornmann does some tricks of legerdemain which are clever, if not new, and Dean and Jose, in their satire on society's four hundred, are a clever pair, although their little skit is not the most refined in the world. They are both clever, however, and well worth seeing. The management is to be congratulated on the general excellence of the performance, and the determination to produce nothing but first-class attractions should be noted and appreciated by their patrons. The Theatre Royal is this week producing a melodrama based much on the lines of some of its old-time sensational attractions, of which there has been of late a lack. It is "The Great North-West," and when it is stated that the principal incidents occur in a spot that is undergoing a boom, and where a horse thief is regarded as worse than a murderer, the idea of exciting scenes will at once suggest itself. And there is no dearth of thrills. There is the arrival of the first railway train at Boom City; there is a rescue from a prairie fire; there is a trial for horse stealing, with every prospect of a lynching; there is a blizzard, during which a fight between two enemies ensues, and there is a somewhat thrilling swing on one of the sails of a windmill by a woman who wishes to save the life of the man she loves. Of villainy and plots for revenge there is any amount; and love, misplaced and otherwise, is dealt out in homeopathic doses, whilst veins of various types of comedy come along at refreshingly opportune moments. The production was well received yesterday by large houses, the scenery, which is above the average staged at the Royal, adding considerably to the enjoyableness of the piece. The characters, as a whole, are fairly well taken. The role of Captain Sheaf, the hero, is ably filled by Mr.

18970419: TUPUNGATO CONQUERED. On one of the Great Volcanic Peaks of the Andes Ascended for the First Time. London, April 18. The Chronicle will tomorrow publish a dispatch from Vaca, Argentine Republic, recording another achievement by the Fitzgerald mountain-climbing expedition in the Andes. The members of the expedition started on March 25 up the Tupungato Valley to ascend the Tupungato Mountain, which had never been ascended. The mountain is directly south of Mount Aconcagua, believed to be the highest mountain in the Andes, and which was ascended by the Fitzgerald expedition about two months ago. When the party had reached a high altitude on the slope of Tupungato...

Let me know if you need any further assistance! Here is the corrected text:

Tupungato. They were driven back three times by strong winds and intense cold. The fourth venture was made on April 11, on the sight of which day the party slept at an altitude of 17,000 feet above sea level. The morning of April 12 dawned without a cloud in the sky, and the party proceeded toward the summit. When a height of 20,000 feet had been reached, all the porters gave out and were obliged to retrace their steps. The explorer Vines and the Swiss guide Surbriggen continued, however, and arrived in the afternoon of the 12th on the summit of Tupungato Mountain, a virgin peak. The instruments which the climbers carried with them showed the mountain to be 21,000 feet above sea level. It is a volcanic mountain, and from it was obtained a magnificent view of Mount Aconcagua, standing to the northward absolutely alone. Twenty miles to the westward, an active volcano was seen. The mercury at the top of Mount Tupungato registered 10 below.

LOST HALF THEIR STOCK  
Blizzards and Floods Hard on Cattlemen  
Cattlemen in Iowa Sioux City, Ia., April 16. Between blizzards and high water, cattle on the ranges throughout the Northwest have been having a tough time of it since the first of last winter's storms. In several South Dakota counties, the loss to stockmen will be 40 or 50 percent. In many instances, it will foot up to 25 to 30 percent, and scarcely anywhere will it fall below 20. The losses came notwithstanding the fact that unusual precautions were taken last fall to supply stock liberally with hay and to fence them in on comparatively small tracts to prevent drifting before heavy storms. Had not such precautions been taken, the general opinion is that most of the big herds throughout the section would have been completely wiped out. The winter opened unprecedentedly early, the storms were remarkably severe and frequent, and when the high water struck, the herds found them weakened by cold and hunger and unable to fight for their lives. The big Sioux, Floyd, Vermillion, Jim, Elkborn, and Little Sioux Rivers were black with floating cattle, hogs, and poultry when the ice went out. Such losses will aggregate millions and will not be made up for years.

April 27: The extremes of weather so far this week throughout northern New York have been a very hot summer day and thunderstorms Sunday, and a heavy snowstorm and blizzard all Monday night and up to ten o'clock today. Six or eight inches of snow now covers the ground. Milkmen were making their deliveries this morning on runners.

THE RESORT

L.F. were to play the Berks on board, but when they arrived at the barracks, the Berks were not there; they had gone on board the transport as soon as the Leinsters arrived at the barracks. There was no departing music. "The Girl I Left Behind Me" was there in the flesh, but not in the old familiar tune. Heartbroken maidens were not much in evidence, though a lady of color caused quite a commotion after the gate shut forever on the departing regiment. The Berks were given a great send-off. Officers and men have been well liked in Halifax. As a rule, the men behaved well. Besides the Leinsters, the Avoca brought 67 Royal Engineers, 127 Royal Artillery, one Army Ordinance Corps, 35 women, and 104 children. The Avoca is now on her way to Bermuda with the Royal Berkshires. After leaving Halifax, she will call at Bermuda, then go to Barbados, St. Lucia, Jamaica, St. Helena, Natal, Mauritius, Bombay, Karachi, and from there home to Southampton via the Suez Canal, Malta, and Gibraltar, being due home early in January. The Avoca is an able-looking ship of 1,053 tons net and 1,734 gross. She has engines of 250 horsepower and is owned by Hajee Cusum Jootub of Bombay. For the past two years, she has been under charter to the Spanish Government and has been engaged carrying troops from Barcelona to Cuba. A noticeable circumstance in connection with the Royal Canadians is that a larger number of the regiment are Roman Catholics and will worship at St. Patrick's in Halifax.

We have been asked, says the Broad Arrow, whether the latest thing in medals, in the early days of the settlement of the Dakotas, the newspapers frequently contained stories of the hardships and sufferings and sometimes the death of the new settlers who were lost in the blizzards. The man or woman who is frozen to death in a winter's storm undergoes great sufferings, but they are mild compared with those daily borne by thousands of victims of that dread disease, consumption. For centuries this relentless disease was considered incurable. It is now known to be distinctly curable. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery cures 98 percent of all cases of consumption, bronchitis, asthma, laryngitis, and diseases of the air passages. It has stood the test for thirty years. It acts directly on the blood, nourishing it with the life-giving qualities of food. It tears down old, half-dead tissues and builds up new ones in all parts of the body. Through the blood, it acts directly on the lungs, driving out all impurities and disease germs. It soothes the cough, but facilitates expectoration. It deepens the breathing, supplying the system with life-giving oxygen. It stimulates the appetite, facilitates the flow of digestive juices, invigorates the liver, and tones and builds up the nerves. It is the great blood-maker and flesh-builder. It does not make flabby flesh like cod liver oil, but firm, muscular, healthy tissues.

"I had been troubled with bronchitis for several years," writes Mrs. Orlin O'Hara, Box 114, Fergus Falls, Ottertail Co., Minn. "In the first place, I had a sore throat. I doctored with different doctors and took various medicines, but got no relief. I raised from my throat a sticky substance like the white of an egg. I could not sleep, and had made up my mind that I would not live through the winter. I took Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and 'Favorite Prescription' alternately, and in a few days began to see that I was better. I took eight bottles. I have not felt as well in years."

We are not quite sure, the journal answers, but imagine that the answer should be in the affirmative, and certainly these cadets will have done more to earn their decoration than many who now wear the ribbon of the jubilee medal and those of foreign orders, gained by attending court functions abroad. A prominent English paper, in speaking of the granting of this Queen Victoria medal, remarks that it would be much more appropriate and practical were a sword, and not a medal, granted to the youths who are deserving of special recognition at college. No less than seventeen British regiments are now taking part in the operations under General Sir William Lockhart, the largest number employed together in active service in India since the days of the Sepoy mutiny. By the way, the Punjab command is shortly to become vacant, and there is considerable speculation as to Sir William Lockhart's successor. As regards the Aldershot command, when the time of the Duke of Connaught is up, two officers' names are prominently mentioned in connection with it: Lord Methuen and Sir Redvers Buller. It is thought that Lord Methuen will eventually find himself at the Government House, Aldershot. 

The general annual return of the British army for 1896 shows that up to the 1st of January last, the effective strength of the regular army of all ranks was 220,869, of whom 100,641 were at home, 4,711 in Egypt, 38,522 in the colonies, and 76,903 in India. The average number of men in the army during last year was 220,742, of whom 10,584 were cavalry, 37,307 artillery, 3,808 horse, 14,075 field, 1,454 mountain, and 17,586 garrison; 7,829 engineers, 5,851 foot guards, 136,965 infantry of the line, 5,331 colonial corps, 3,581 army service corps, 1,306 army ordnance corps, 2,609 medical staff corps, and 673 army pay corps. The total number of recruits obtained was 28,532, of whom 27,670 were raised at home, 22,104 being recruited in England, 2,825 in Scotland, and 2,865 in Ireland. The total number of trials by court martial was 9,167, and the number of minor punishments, including fines for drunkenness (14,441), was 206,857; 105,666 men possessed good conduct badges and 870 men had good conduct medals. The annual inspection of the 65th Battalion, Mount Royal Rifles, postponed from last spring, will take place on the Champ de Mars at half-past three o'clock this afternoon. Lieutenant Colonel Maunsell, Inspector of Infantry, will come up from Fredericton for the affair and will make the inspection with Lieutenant Colonel Gordon, U.C.O. The inspection of the right and left half battalions was satisfactorily made on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, respectively, and last evening the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Labels, made his inspection. It is understood that Lieutenant Colonel Gordon is pleased with what he has seen of the regiment, particularly with the officers, who are smart and energetic. It will be seen this afternoon whether the regiment is, or is not, strong numerically, for it has been said that the parades in some cases have not been what they should. With the population that the 65th, the only French battalion in Montreal, has to call upon, it should be not only the strongest regiment in Montreal but one of the strongest in Canada. Captain Peltier, of the 65th Battalion, was in the Police Court this week prosecuting two members of the regiment for non-attendance at drill. One of them pleaded guilty and was reprimanded, and sentence was suspended. The other man pleaded not guilty. His lawyer protested that first he should have been advised to attend drill and afterwards a month's time should have been allowed before proceedings were taken against him. The judge has the case under deliberation.

In charge of the instrumental measurement and astronomical work for the determination of the first meridian, besides the ascertainment of the point at which the Yukon crossed that meridian, the object of the expedition was to obtain all possible information touching a large tract of country, as yet little known, forming the extreme northwesterly portion of the Northwest Territory. The Yukon district lies between the northern boundary of British Columbia, lat 60, and the Arctic Ocean, and between the 141st meridian on the west and the 136th meridian and the Rocky Mountain ridges on the east. It has thus an approximate area of 192,000 square miles, which is about ten times the area of Nova Scotia or three times that of New England. As to its general character, Dr. Dawson thought it might be compared with the Russian province of Vologda. The province in question, situated between latitudes 68 and longitude 60, has an area, according to the Stateman's Year-Book, of 155,498 square miles and a population of 1,239,705. Dr. Dawson fixed upon Vologda, and not Archangel, because it is inland with respect to the White Sea, as the Yukon district is inland with respect to Bering Sea and the Yukon Delta. So far as isotherms are concerned, however, Archangel would be, perhaps, a better parallel, though in its relation to the Ural Mountains, Vologda has conditions that match the Canadian region. Hepworth Dixon began his Russian tour at the north and passed through both Archangel and Vologda. His first stage was by tarantass from Solovetsk to Archangel. Solovetsk is a town that has grown up around a famous convent (that of Saints Savatle and Zozima) on an islet of the same name in Onega Bay. To this shrine, emperors as well as peasants have gone on pilgrimage. There is a like delta of isles and islets at the mouth of the Dowlna. Having entered the river by the most convenient of its twelve arms, the newcomer catches a glimpse of a forest of domes and spires, the domes of all colors, the spires all golden. This is Archangel. Here's the corrected text:

succeeded in landing, he finds a camp of shanties around groups of belfries and cupolas. "Imagine a vast green marsh along the bank of a broad brown river, with mounds of clay cropping here and there out of the peat and bog; put buildings with frescoes, crown them with cupolas and crosses; fill the space between church and convent with piles and planks, so as to make ground for gardens, streets, and yards; cut two wide lanes from the church called 'Smith's Wife' to the monastery of St. Michael, three or four miles in length; paint the walls of church and convent white, the domes green and blue; surround the log houses with open gardens; stick a geranium, a fuchsia, an oleander in every window; leave the grass growing everywhere in street and clearing and there you have Archangel." Such is Hepworth Dixon's picture of the northern Russian seaport at latitude 13, nearly the same as that of Dawson City. Not far from Archangel is Hukkogory, birthplace of Lomonosov, poet and philosopher, greatly honored by his countrymen. It is a city set on a hill, pretty and bright, with golden crops in sight and grassy roads, pink and white houses on the wide streets, boats on the river, and stretches of yellow sunlight, churches, cloisters, and all around forests of pine and birch. This northern part of Russia just swarms with villages on both sides of the Arctic Circle. For navigation, however, Archangel, Onega, and other sub-Arctic Russian ports are not so favorably situated as those of Norway, Tromsø, and Hammerfest. The latter, in latitude 70 degrees, 40 minutes, 11 seconds, is, so far, the most northerly town in the world. It has a population of over 2,000 souls, and, though he can occasionally light his cigar at midnight with a sunglass, the Hammerfester is by no means cut off from the outer world. Electric light, introduced some years ago, is in general use and one can telegraph in all directions. Though the inhabitants are said to be of a pensive turn, they are not at all without enjoyments. They are industrious and, besides the characteristic industries, in which the export of cod liver oil has a prominent place, there are shops of all kinds and the fashions are not unknown. St. Petersburg is in the latitude (60 degrees) of the southern boundary of the Yukon district. North of that line are some important Russian provinces west of the Urals, the Grand Duchy of Finland, nearly the whole of Norway, and a considerable portion of Sweden. On the American continent, the isotherms correspond with parallels of latitude much less than they do in the Old World. Mr. Dull, who was the first to write about Alaska at the transfer to the United States, and in whose statements Dr. Dawson generally places confidence, says that the winters on the Yukon may be compared to those of Canada and Minnesota. The air is crisp and cold, with occasional blizzards. The mid-winter temperature may average 30 degrees below zero (Fahrenheit). The summer comes on with amazing rapidity and during the mosquito season life is unendurable without a net or leather gloves. About May 20, the river bursts its bonds and the lowlands are flooded. The cry of the brant, sailing northward, is heard, and all the minor forms of life are afoot, on the wing, or creeping in the low grass. Vegetation springs at a bound into leaf and flower. Both Dr. Dawson and Mr. Ogilvie devote some attention to the agricultural capacities of the Yukon district. The former quotes Mr. James Anderson, of the Hudson Bay Company, in proof of the fact, questioned by Petroff, that potatoes and barley were grown at Fort Yukon. From all that he has learned by personal observation and otherwise, Dr. Dawson did not hesitate to affirm that such hardy crops as barley, rye, turnips, and flax could be successfully raised as far north as the former site of Fort Selkirk near the 63rd parallel. It is also interesting to know that excellent summer grazing for horses and cattle can be found along the river valleys, while natural hay meadows are frequent. In Appendix I, Dr. Dawson gives important information as to the distribution of trees and in Appendix III a verified list of the plants that he collected in the Yukon district and adjacent parts of British Columbia. Mr. Ogilvie, though not enthusiastic as to the agricultural capabilities of the Pelly-Yukon basin, mentions some tracts here and there that admit of cultivation. For instance, there is Ogilvie Valley (so called in his honor by the chief of the expedition). Northward from the end of Lake Labarge, mixed timber, poplar, and spruce occurs of a size that betokens fair soil, while the herbaceous is more than usually rich for that region. Several such exceptional tracts are mentioned. On the whole, however, Mr. Ogilvie forms a very moderate estimate of the total area of agricultural land in the Yukon district. He thinks that 360 square miles would be a generous allowance. That would make 230,400 acres or about 1,000 farms for the Yukon-Pelly basin, and he estimates the available land on the affluents of the river at about the same figure. It is to the discovery and development of its mineral wealth that, in his judgment, the region will owe whatever prosperity is in store for it. The Yukon country has long been the scene of missionary labor and Mr. Ogilvie acknowledges its good effects on some of the Indians with whom he came in contact. The Greek Church had established missions in Alaska before the transfer to the United States. The Roman Catholic Church has a large staff of workers engaged. There was an Anglican missionary at Fort Yukon as early as 1861, and Presbyterian, Methodist, and Moravian missionaries carry on the work of evangelization on both sides of the frontier. Now that provision has been made for the maintenance of law and order in the district, the residents will enjoy that security of person and property which pertains to a civilized community and the future development of that great lone land will be awaited with interest. There are no quarrels so bitter as family quarrels, and this holds good of newspapers as well as individuals. The dispute between the two leading Liberal papers of British Columbia, the Victoria Times and the Vancouver World, waxes hotter and hotter as the days go by. The Times describes the World's editorial as "a splenetic Jeremiad," and the World retorts by calling the Times' Editor (Senator Templeman) an unsuccessful fabricator, who went round, hat in hand, pauper-like, imploring the assistance and influence of everyone with whom he came in contact. The World has two columns and a half on the subject, winding up with the following peroration: "If the Times is not aware of these facts, the sooner a night school is established for the education of writers of such misleading sentences as the above, the sooner will the period be reached when it will cease to become the laughing stock of the community, and display its culpable ignorance of the country in which it is published." The remarkable development of dairying in Canada is again illustrated in the review of the export trade of this city during the season of 1897, printed this morning. For the first time, the transatlantic shipments of cheese have exceeded the two million boxes mark, while as regards butter there has been since 1896 an increase from 157,821 packages to 220,200 packages. The value of the whole to the producers approximates sixteen and a half million dollars. THEATRE FRANCHISES, WEEK OF NOVEMBER 22nd "GOOD MORNING BLIND," AND HAMMERVILLE AND DAILY, the Happy Hour. Prices: 10, 20 and 30. Office Open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. AT LENNOXVILLE, ON FRIDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 1897. WHEAT IS BOOMING. The December option sells at one dollar at Chicago. FOREIGN ADVICES ALL STRONG. Blizzard raging west. Visible will show small increase. Kansas crop report gives area winter wheat sixteen percent increase. Friday Evening. This was a bull day in the Chicago wheat pit and considerable excitement prevailed, especially in the December option which sold 4c higher at $1.00, and the market closed strong at an advance of 1 1/4c to 3 1/8c, at 99c, November; 99 1/2c December; 94 3/8c May; 87c July. Corn shows little change in spite of the above, prices closing 1/8c higher at 26 1/8c November; 26 1/8c December; 29 5/8c May. Oats closed 20 1/2c November; 20 1/2c December; 22 1/4c May. New York, November 26. After several weeks of unsatisfactory markets, "dollar wheat," in the speculative acceptance of the term, was realized on 'Change today. The December option early attained that figure and soon passed it, reaching $1.00 3/8 in the afternoon, which was also the final price. A bad squeeze of the shorts was chiefly responsible for local strength, although higher cables had much to do with the early advancing tendency of local markets. S. Bache & Co., of Chicago, wire their manager, C. D. Monk, as follows: Liverpool cable advanced 3/8d yesterday and 1/4d early this a.m., but lost the 1/4d advance later. Paris markets were higher, November being quoted equivalent to 1 13/16 per bushel. San Francisco, which heretofore has advanced strongly, is up again today two cents per bushel. Demand for flour at Minneapolis is good. Exporters took 25 loads at the seaboard today and closed up 250,909 on Wednesday. The Modern Miller construed bearish but stated demand for flour is good, owing to heavy flour sales. Blizzard raging in the west and headed this way promising to reach winter wheat fields tonight. Considering the plant and condition, unless accompanied by snow, it will not be a serious circumstance. Receipts Northwest are still strong and weather seems to be the only impediment in sight. Kansas crop report makes wheat yield 50,000,000 bushels, and the winter wheat just sown, 16 percent increase, condition high, outlook for visible Monday is for a slight increase against a decrease of a million last year and Bradstreet's exports for the week will show well notwithstanding the intervening holding. The shorts in December were scared and the price of that option went easily to a dollar. We think there was some selling of a depressing kind on the part of a clique but not to any great extent and we think this flurry only foreshadows what in a larger way is likely to take place in that option at any time. We repeat again, "Get out of December option and stay out of it." Cable advices to the Board of Trade this morning were as follows: Cargoes off coast, wheat, nothing doing; maize, nothing doing. Cargoes on passage, wheat nominally unchanged; maize, firm. Parcels of No. 1 hard Manitoba wheat, steam on passage, 37s 6d; American clipped oats, 14s d. December Liverpool Spot wheat, firm; spot maize, firm; No. 2 spring spot wheat, 7s 1 1/2d to 7s 9d; mixed American spot maize, 3s 3 1/4d. Minneapolis first bakers' flour 25s 3d. Futures Wheat steady, 7s 6 5/8d December; 7s 7d March; 7s 6d May; maize, steady, 3s 2 3/4d November; 3s 2 7/8d December; 2 1/2d March. Paris Wheat, 30.75 November; 29.50 December; flour, 62.90 November; 62.30 December. French country markets, firm. There was a good demand from foreign buyers in this market today for Duluth hard and Manitoba wheat and some large sales were made.

AT MIDNIGHT MASS

Thousands Crowded the Churches Last Night. THE MUSIC WAS BEAUTIFUL and in keeping with the festive occasion. Real Christmas weather replaced the afternoon's blizzard. The mass at midnight, one of the features of the Catholic Church at this time of the year, when people seem to be under the benign influence of all that is good and pretty and attractive, was perhaps never better attended at the different churches in the city than was the case last night. Blizzards might have marked the day when the question of buying presents was a real difficulty; but when it came to the night, then there was a change in keeping with the season. The atmosphere seemed tempered to the geniality of the time. The rawness and severity of the afternoon seemed to have hid itself away before the bells tolled of the midnight services. The sky cleared itself and the twinkling stars appeared as if they were little holes picked in a mantle of night to let celestial spirits peep out at the doings of their terrestrial kindred, while all were joining in a great hosanna to the Man God. The heavier chimes that came from the church towers, and their music mingled into a harmonious whole as grand, as impressive, as inspiring as any theme that ever lifted Haydn or Mozart or Beethoven above mere earthly things. The whole of nature, which is usually quiet at midnight, seemed to have been awakened. The glad tidings of great joy resounded again and came almost as sweetly as did the angelic voices to the shepherds in the lonely hills of Bethlehem. And then the stars were all out, too; they seemed to vie with each other in shining their brightest, as if they followed their prototype that guided the Magi. But the heavens last night were full of guiding stars. There was not the thunder of hail; but there was that tremulous atmospheric motion that spoke musically of things agreeable that fitted into the season as if all living beings should be happy. The spires that shine like burnished gold in the drowsy summer days had on their coats of dazzling white and stood out like silhouettes against the winter sky. The flakes that flustered down fell as gently as manna feeding the first steps of the looked-for winter. And even they fell softly in consonance with the time when "Gloria in Excelsis Deo" first fell on the midnight air and spoke to the hearts of men through shepherds. It was a perfect Christmas night, when every feeling that was human seemed to be tinctured with some of the religion that lies latent in everybody's breast. The season that makes everybody feel better to his fellows, that prompts the making up of quarrels, that makes one shake hands not perfunctorily, but as if one meant it; the season when above all times everything looks brighter than even the occasion may permit, could have had a better exemplification than last night, and from all quarters of the city came to the churches men influenced by the spirit of the occasion whose heads bowed reverently, and whose hearts were rejoiced as the echo of "Peace on earth" filled the ears. At Christmas time, perhaps, there are few things more religiously important than the midnight mass, and there are few cities in the world where such popular importance is attached to it as in Montreal. All the Catholic churches last night were filled to overflowing. The musical arrangements were of the most elaborate character; there had been preparation for many weeks and in all cases were the services equal to the importance attached to the occasion. At the Church of Notre Dame, a grand choir of over two hundred voices under the leadership of Mr. McMahon, rendered Rheinberger's Mass in D major, with the "Credo" from Gounod's Messe Solennelle. Gounod's third mass was sung at the Church of the Gesu, Niedermeier's mass was sung at St. James Church, and Fauré's at St. Anne's. At Mount St. Louis Institute, Rev. Brother Bonitus' mass was rendered.

18971227: "JACKSON'S PLANS

Intends to Start for the North Pole in the Near Future. London, December 25. As soon as Jackson, the explorer, completes the work connected with his Franz Josef Land expedition, he will start for the North Pole. He informed a representative of the Associated Press that his original plans were identical with those of Lieut. Peary, except that he intended to take the east coast of the island instead of the west, mapping out undiscovered land en route. But, since he heard Lieut. Peary's lecture, Jackson has changed his plans. Considering that Peary had prior claims, Jackson now proposes to proceed via Davis' Straits and Baffin's Bay, up the west coast to Ellesmere Land and Greenland, and thence across to the furthermost point reached by Aldrich in 1876 whence he will push north, making in the direction of any land visible from the coast. The date of his departure is unsettled. Jackson will have only one companion outside of his crew. Talking over his plans, he said: "I hope to push my ship considerably beyond Coburg Island, at the entrance of Jones' Sound. At the furthest navigable point I shall establish a base and thence push north with sledges, dogs, and ponies, and with one companion I expect to be absent about two years." 

A Curious Query (Moncton Times) 

In the purchase of railway ties at an excessive price from party friends in Quebec for transportation 700 miles to Cape Breton, evidence of the adoption of a "business policy" on the Intercolonial? Or is it "business is business?"

IN OLD MONTREAL

How the City Looked to a Westerner's Eyes. SUNDAY SEEMED QUIET. The Street Car Peculiarities. Relations with the Twin Cities - The Oldest Newspaper - (St. Paul Globe) Montreal, December 12. For the first time since the Globe started, January 15, 1878, I am passing a Sabbath in a city where there is no seven-day-a-week paper, and Sunday is the day omitted. There is a weekly Sunday paper here of very modest proportions, and the clergy certainly have no reason to complain of the Sunday newspapers of Montreal detracting from devotional exercises. On the principle of "the better the day, the better the deed," while all the other people in the city have gone to church, I concluded to pay my devotions to the Globe. I have had so many invitations to go to church that I imagine there is nothing else going on in this town on Sunday. The saloons are all closed, and, unlike an American city, which considers its freedom abridged when it can't get a drink, nobody worries, but all accept it as a matter of course. I cannot learn that the health of the city suffers or that there has been any increased mortality owing to "dry Sundays." Perhaps the climate differs from the States, and damp atmosphere prevents the internal bureau from becoming dry. When I struck the Canadian line I ran into a blizzard, which continued all the way and two days after I arrived, so that I felt I had brought "all the comforts of home" right along with me. Everything was on runners, and the only wheeled vehicles to be seen were the streetcars. I felt like improving on Mr. Kipling's tribute to "The Lady of the Snows" and making it read: "There was a small boy in Montreal who was buried in snow head and all. When asked, 'Are you friz?' He says 'Yes, I is, but we don't call that cold in Montreal.'" 

Perhaps just to prove this, the weather clerk ordered up rain: the carriage wheels have disappeared and today people, feeling the necessity of going to church, emblematic of the old proverb, stand on slippery places. By not going, I have no difficulty in keeping on my feet. The mind of the American public when thinking of Montreal (at least that portion of the mind which is writing this letter) is clearly associated with ice palaces and smallpox. With ice palaces, because Montreal was the first to borrow the idea from St. Petersburg on this continent, and set an example which St. Paul was quick to follow. With smallpox, owing to the almost religious war which was waged against vaccination. But both have now passed away, and the visitor can no longer enjoy either. The ice palace novelty wore out, as it did in St. Paul, and both places have apparently concluded that they will have just as much climate to the square inch without going to the trouble and expense of a palace to prove what is a self-evident fact.

THE STREET CARS

Some of the electric streetcars go up and down hills with grades approximating Selby Avenue, with ease, and Merriam Park might take heart of hope from this fact, after St. Paul elects a new city council, which will not increase the Selby Avenue grade by legislative attachments. The streetcars stop on both sides of the crossings, so that you can catch them coming and going and amidship as well, if you step daintily on your pins. The fenders hang so high that, instead of throwing a person off the track, he can roll right under the wheels. This is a great convenience for those who fall down or sleep on the tracks. They collect the fares in a contribution box with a slot; it is a box about ten inches high by six wide, and the slot will just admit a thin Canadian 5-cent piece or a ticket. The box has a handle like a beer mug, and is hung on a hook by the door at the rear end of the car, and the conductor passes it around to each passenger, in a manner which would remind one of a foreign missionary collection in a church, if the slot were wide enough to admit a button. If you have not got the change, the conductor will make it for you, handing it all back to you, and you drop in your own fare. It differs from the foreign missionary collection in that everyone contributes. Still, it reminds me of my usual Sabbath experiences. Montreal ought to be a bonanza for artists who practice streetcar holdups. The box hangs on a hook by the open door at the rear of the car, and all you need to do is to grab it off the hook, bat the conductor over the head, and run. It looks so easy that it is tempting. Most of the streets have French names, and, if you are looking for some place that you can't find on a dark night, and a French conductor calls the streets, you don't know whether you are riding in the English or French language. There is one advantage: you can get off and walk and find your street perhaps. I know this from experience, but have not tackled the contribution box yet, and cannot speak of that with as much positiveness as to ultimate results.

X Poullot, who was killed last fall by a tub of coal on board ship falling on him, has taken action against the owners of the vessel for $15,000. News has reached here of the death in Boston of Rev. Father Anderson, late of St. Patrick's Church here. Today's storm was the worst of the season, being in fact a blizzard. The snowfall is quite heavy. The electric railway contrived to keep its lines open and to operate them but only with great difficulty. Quite an avalanche fell from Cape Diamond into Champlain Street, completely blocking it but without doing any other damage. A large gang of men was set at work to dig out a new road.

ON RAILROAD LINES: Surprisingly Little Difficulty in the Handling of Trains - The storm, strange to say, did not to a great extent affect railway traffic. It appeared to have been confined to Eastern Ontario, Quebec, and a section of the Maritime Provinces. In conversation with passengers who happened to reach the city, there was some astonishment expressed at the blockade. The Canada Atlantic train which left the Capital at 8 o'clock yesterday morning was the first to strike a snag, and it wasn't the beautiful either. At St. Dominique, a snow plough left the track, and for three long hours the belated passengers waited for the arrival of the wrecking train. That the storm was confined to a limited area was demonstrated in the fact that the Delaware & Hudson train, due at 7:30, was only two hours and a half late, and the detention was at St. Johns. This was also further accentuated by the non-arrival of the Halifax express, due at 6:50, but which was six hours late, owing to the storm in the eastern part of the province. According to dispatches received at headquarters last evening, the blizzard seemed to be raging in all its force in a westerly direction. The No. 1 Western over the Grand Trunk system was stalled at Cornwall, and the indications were that if there was not a moderation in the elements, there would be a harrowing tale to tell as far as the passengers were concerned. The majority of those lucky ones who succeeded in reaching the city last evening expressed more or less surprise at the mountains of snow which met their gaze. The trains, as before stated, made good time. The drifts, according to the stories of some of the passengers, were the deepest in many years, and but for the admirable manner in which the trouble was tackled by the executive of the road, would have caused them no little inconvenience.

WORK OF THE STREET RAILROAD: Most of the Lines Kept Open by Dint of such Hard Work. Citizens have often asked themselves when they have read of blizzards and snowstorms occurring in different parts of the country what would the Montreal Street Railway do under similar circumstances. The company work speaks for itself. Yesterday they had a snowstorm all to themselves, for fortunately the day being the Sabbath, there was very little vehicular traffic, and the snow ploughs and sweepers were enabled to precede the cars and throw the snow on each side with impunity. In many parts of the city, the snow on each side of the tracks was piled up to a height of four feet. As soon as the roadmasters on duty at night found that there were indications of a storm, they notified the workshops, and within a few minutes, gangs of men were placed on the sweepers and they were sent to all parts of the city. Superintendent McDonagh was immediately on the scene and he set out extra cars in order to keep the rails from freezing. A continuous service was kept to all parts of the city, and with the exception of points where there is a steep grade, the service remained uninterrupted. At points where a car got stuck for a few minutes, it was helped out of its predicament either by a snow sweeper or by the aid of another electric car. This was particularly the case on Windsor Street, Park Avenue, and St. Denis Streets. The "Point service" was not interfered with, the roadmaster having a large gang of men keeping the tracks clear until the space between the sidewalk and the track got jammed. This is one of the street railway's drawbacks on this line, as on Wellington Street the sidewalk is boarded up, and as the sidewalk is close to the track, as soon as the sweeper passed along, the sidewalk was conspicuous by its absence. The men, however, by hard work, succeeded in keeping a better sidewalk in this locality than in many streets where the cars do not run. At Westmount, the company kept one line clear around the belt. The cars went up Greene Avenue and returned to the city by the way of the Glen. If Westmount could have procured sufficient force of men, both lines would have been operated. Pedestrians going to and from the churches and other places found it more convenient to walk on the car track than on the sidewalks. This had its disadvantages to both the pedestrian and motorman, for while the latter was necessarily compelled to run at a slow rate of speed on this account, many pedestrians waited until the car was within a length or so of them and then they made frantic efforts to jump aside. Some of these people, in their endeavor to perform acrobatic feats, made themselves look very grotesque, especially when they came out of a four-foot drift. The cars were also delayed at different parts of the city by carters getting onto the tracks and their horses being unable to get up to the snow road; they continued their way unmolested until a street corner was reached. One gentleman of the West End who was suddenly called to another part of the city to go on duty was afraid that he would not be on time as there were no cars in sight. Seeing a friendly milkman making a frantic effort to bring his milk into the city, the gentleman made a bargain with the driver to take him for 60 cents. They had not proceeded more than three blocks when the sweeper came along followed by a passenger car. The gentleman, however, did not care to take chances, and stuck to the milk cart, with the result that he was not marked "late." The Street Railway shops on Cote Street last night presented an animated scene, hundreds of men receiving shovels to work in all parts of the city. The work was continued all night, and with the aid of the gangs employed by the city, the company's officials believe they will have the road clear for vehicular traffic today. To facilitate this, the sweepers and extra cars were running all night. The Park & Island railway service was demoralized. Trip Rack River and Outremont cars did not come into the city for the day, and the Lachine cars were unable to make more than a few trips on account of the storm.

18980125: THE ANCIENT CAPITAL. Mr. Malouin Elected to the Commons - Cartridge Factory Reopened. Quebec, January 24 (Special) Mr. Albert Malouin was elected by acclamation this morning as member for Quebec Centre in the Commons to replace Hon. François Langeller, appointed judge of the Superior Court. Mr. Malouin is 40 years of age, having been born in Quebec on March 13, 1867. He is the son of Jacques Malouin, Q.C., ex-member for Quebec Centre, and was admitted to the Bar in 1892. There is now a solid ice bridge in front of the city, the result of yesterday's blizzard, which prevented the boats crossing and keeping the key from forming. The bulk of the ice moved up with the tide this morning and the ferry boats plied safely for some hours. But they could not cut the key, and when the ice came back again, it jammed and is now solid, several people having crossed it on foot this afternoon. Work was resumed today in the cartridge factory by orders from Ottawa, and all the recently dismissed men have been taken back. 

Died in His Father's Arms. Evansville, Ind., January 24. During the storm last night, on the river near here, George Atkins and his little daughter, who lived on a boat, were drowned by the wrecking of the craft. The little one died with her arms around her father's neck. 

STRENGTH HAS RETURNED. "My whole system was run down. I was so weak I could scarcely get around to do my work. I finally began to take Hood's Sarsaparilla and after using five bottles, I found that my strength had returned and my appetite was better. I now feel as strong as ever." Mrs. Kelley, 9 Wellington Avenue, Toronto, Ontario. Hood's Pills are the best family cathartic and liver tonic. Gentle, reliable. 

SAY I WASH THERE. The Bequest Made by Mrs. Poirier of Her Accomplice. THE ALLEGED CONFESSION. Examination of Detectives McCaskill Is Begun - The Defense Loses Another Important Legal Point. Ste. Scholastique, January 24 (Special). At the opening of the court, Mr. Poirier drew attention to the fact that one of the Montreal newspapers had published on Saturday two sketches represented as having been made by the prisoner in her cell. He protested against the impression being given to the public that the prisoner was employing her leisure in this way. While it would not affect the present trial, it might possibly have some effect on a future one, should, for any reason, a new trial be had. These sketches could not have been obtained elsewhere than in the prisoner's house, and they were not given by her or with her permission, and their publication showed a want of diligence on the part of the Crown guardian. The Judge said that the jury were not allowed to see any newspapers; there could have been no harm done, as far as any influence on their mind was concerned. It was the duty of the High Constable to see that the premises were properly guarded, and he would urge on that official the necessity of seeing that the guardians immediately in charge did their duty. The first witness heard was Assistant Jailor Groulx, who had heard some snatches of conversation between the prisoners while in durance vile. Mr. Poirier objected to evidence being received of statements made by the accused while laboring under intense excitement. He was prepared to prove that as the result of her interviews with the detective and others, her mind was in such a condition that any statements by her could not be considered made freely or voluntarily. He asked that before the present witness' examination be gone on with, he be allowed to put Coroner Mignault in the box to prove the condition of mind in which the accused was at the time the assistant jailer heard the conversations referred to. Crown Prosecutor Mathieu said he only wanted to prove some words which passed between the prisoner and Sam Parslow, when she did not know there was any witness near, and when there could have been no question of fear or compulsion. The court held that a conversation between the two accomplices was a different matter from confessions made to detectives. If later on it were proved that this conversation was the natural outcome of the confessions made to detectives, he might possibly make of them a reserve case; but in the meantime, he had to overrule the objection. The assistant jailer then swore that shortly after the first, the second called out "Bum," and Parslow replied "Eh?" The accused then said: "Say I was not there and it will be all right." The witness then went to the prisoners and told them not to speak so any more. On another occasion, he heard the accused say several times: "Killing, killing. They make me crazy, and then I will go out." A sister of the accused was then called, but her evidence was so contradictory to that...

This corrected text maintains the original meaning and formatting as much as possible while fixing OCR errors. Given by her at the preliminary inquiry that very little value can be attached to it. After recess, Detective McCaskill was called and related his doings up to the moment when he obtained an avowal from the prisoner. Mr. Poirier then subjected him to very severe cross-examination in order to prove that any confession he may have obtained was not given voluntarily, but the result of menaces or threats or pressure equivalent to threats on the part of the detective. When the circumstances under which the confession was obtained are proved, then the question of the legality of their admission will be argued by the counsel. Mr. Poirier made a motion based on article 667 that the Crown witnesses be detained in court in case that any of them should be required by the defense. Judge Taschereau asked that the particular witnesses required be named as the defense could not possibly want all of them, but on Mr. Poirier insisting that it was out of his power to name at present those he required, the motion was granted. Tomorrow Mr. McCaskill's examination will be resumed.

18980202: "A GREAT STORM," (Continued from first page) Trains from Toronto due here at 11 o'clock a.m. got in about 7:20 last night, and, in fact, all the trains from the west were more or less delayed. The Halifax train was about seven hours late. All the available snow plows were called into requisition, and additional gangs of men were engaged on various sections of the roads to keep the machinery of travel from clogging entirely. - Quebec, February 1 (Special) The snow drifts following yesterday's storm have been pretty heavy, and all incoming trains were greatly behind time today, and none of the morning mails from the West were delivered till the afternoon. The snowfall has not been very heavy in the city, but the plows and sweepers of the Street Railroad were out all night, fighting the storm. Belleville, Ont., February 1. The roads have been heavily drifted by the blizzard of last night and today, and travel has been greatly impeded. The river has been partially blocked by anchor ice and snow, and the water has backed into all the cellars along Front Street and into the lower floors of many dwellings on the flats in West Belleville. 

THE WORST IN MANY YEARS That is the report from many New England points; Gloucester, Mass., February 1. The storm at Gloucester was one of the worst in a great many years and the damage, which is in its wake, will foot up about $200,000. About 1,000 fishing and other vessels were wholly or partially wrecked. Eighteen lives are said to have been lost. A great number of vessels were driven ashore and more or less injured. They succeeded in getting off again. Waterville, Maine, February 1. The most severe storm for 20 years has raged here since Friday morning to 6 o'clock tonight. Business is suspended, houses are even buried in the drifts of snow which run to 20 feet. For the first time in its history, the Rockwool Cotton mills were shut down for a storm. Women and children could not get out. No train over the Maine Central has passed or reached this city in 24 hours. The electric cars are shut down. Worcester, Mass., February 1. Not since the memorable blizzard of March 12, 1888, has this section been so completely snowbound. Business this morning was practically suspended, and the streets in most parts of the city were impassable. The storm began early Monday morning, and for 24 hours it snowed continuously. The high winds that prevailed yesterday and last night made huge drifts, some of them ten or fifteen feet high. Railroad service is at a standstill and there is at this hour no communication of any sort with Boston. None of the local train or telephone companies have a wire working, and it is not known when a mail train can get through. The lines of the electric street railways are tied up and scores of cars were stalled at points along the line all night. There are reports of wrecked trains and many stories of stalled passenger trains which have not yet been verified. At 10 o'clock the storm here was over, and the sun came out. 

Lynn, Mass., February 1. The schooner Charles A. Briggs, bound for Philadelphia from Portland, struck on a rock at Nahant this morning during the storm and is fast going to pieces. The crew of five men were all lost. The body of one unknown man was washed ashore. Providence, R.I. IN NEW YORK STATE Storm did not hit New York City as severely. New York, February 1. Yesterday what threatened to be a repetition of the blizzard of 1888 today developed into bright sunshine and crisp cold winds. The snow, which fell continuously from 3 p.m. yesterday, increased at midnight, after burying greater New York in a white mantle that averaged five inches deep. This morning more than 8,500 shovelers are working hard to remove the snow in the boroughs of Manhattan and Bronx alone. Sleighing for the first time this year was general. Up to 6 a.m. today, about 12,500 loads of snow had been dumped into the river, and still the majority of the streets were bordered with white hillocks. Local traffic, however, resumed its normal conditions and both surface and elevated roads were running as usual. With the exception of the lines running to and from New England, the railroads were not suffering inconvenience. 

THE MARITIME PROVINCES Train Service Badly Broken Up by the Blizzard St. John NEWFOUNDLAND SUFFERS Feared the Loss of Life Will Be Heavy Men Adrift on a Floe - St. John's, Nfld., February 21. Another blizzard is raging here today. A large number of men have been driven off by an ice floe in Trinity Bay and it is feared there will be a repetition of the disaster of seven years ago, when forty perished. The thermometer shows twenty degrees below zero and the cold is so terrible that some loss of life must result. The Government is dispatching a rescue steamer to the endangered men. An unidentified steamer, believed to be the Jamaica, Capt. Petersen from New York, January 25, for St. John's, with a general cargo, is visible in an ice floe off Ferryland, thirty miles south of this port. She is flying distress signals and it is feared that she has been seriously injured and crushed by the ice. 

THE BLIZZARD POSTPONED THE ICE RACES It was impossible after a 24-hour storm to clear the track on the river, so that the races had to be postponed until today. They will start sharp this afternoon at 1:30. A feature will be the guideless pacer Josephine. There was not much difference in the pools that were sold last night. Following is the card for this afternoon: - 2:50 class, Johnnie P, b.g., by Charles Price, H. Clark, H. Belleville, Ont. Sir Oliver M, gr.3, by Sir Lattan Chief, F.

18980204: G. Dun & Co.'s Weekly Statement of Trade in Canada says: The storm of Monday and Tuesday in Montreal, while not marked by nearly so heavy a snowfall as that of last week, was more of a blizzard-like character, and much more widespread in its results. Many travelers have been storm-bound at off-rail points, owing to a blockade of country roads, and the railroads have been operated with considerable difficulty, so that on the whole the week has been a comparatively quiet one as yet as regards business. The municipal elections in the city were also more or less of a distracting element, though not marked by the excitement of other occasions. Country collections are affected by the recent weaker conditions and the effect is noticeable in less liberal general remittances to the wholesale trade. The fourth instant is a heavy day for payments in the dry goods and woolen trade, and some of the larger houses have been receiving a number of remittances from customers against paper then maturing. As far as can be judged, a very fair percentage of paper is likely to be provided for, and there does not appear to be any anticipation of noteworthy failures as a result of default on that day. The money market continues well supplied with funds, and the rate for call loans is unchanged at 5 percent, general discounts to 7 percent. The trade situation at Toronto is unchanged. A hopeful feeling prevails and prices of the leading staples are firm. The movement this week has been curtailed somewhat owing to snow clearing and severe weather, which has checked traffic. Travelers were unable to get about with freedom and in some lines orders did not come in as liberally as had been anticipated. The weather, however, benefited the sorting-up business in heavy woolen goods and the retail coal trade was stimulated. Failures in Ontario this week were more numerous than usual, but generally speaking they are small concerns and not due to any special dullness at this particular time. The scarcity of hides has caused an advance in prices and dealers are now asking 11-12 cents for No. 1 green. Leather dealers complain that they are too high for the product, but report a fair trade. There is a moderate trade in hardware with values steady. In groceries, business is quiet, but there is more inquiry for teas. Canned vegetables are firmer, with peas and tomatoes higher. Dressed hogs in limited receipt, with prices firm, and the product is also firm. The wheat market is unsettled, with prices generally higher than a week ago. Coarse grains are higher. Payments are reported satisfactory. Money is easy with call loans at 4 percent, and prime commercial paper discounted at 6 to 1-2 percent. Business on the Toronto Stock Exchange has been fairly active during the week. Cable and Toronto Electric are higher, as well as Assurance stock. Bank shares are quiet but firm as a rule. Toronto Railway has shown no advance during the week, but it holds its price well. Money in New York is easier with call loans at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 and in London at 2 to 2-1/2 percent. Failures for the week were 89, for the same week of last year 83. 

THE KLONDIKE RUSH Collector Milne Will Not Grant a Desired Favor: Victoria, B.C., February 3. Collector Milne, who is the issuer of miners' licenses, has been informed that the steamer Queen will be over from Seattle tomorrow with several hundred miners who are anxious to obtain licenses, and has been asked whether he would open his office if the steamer should arrive late at night. This the collector will not do. He sees no reason why the Customs officials here should depart from the regular routine to accommodate men who, having bought their outfits in a foreign country, come over here for their licenses, simply because they have to.

18980207: TEDDY EDWARDS' TREMENDOUS TASK More than 8,000 miles have been covered at the rate of 100 miles a day by Teddy Edwards, the plucky little Welshman who started out on the first day of the year to see how many consecutive centuries he could ride. The press throughout the country has intimated that Edwards started out with the idea of undertaking the seemingly impossible task of riding a hundred miles every day in the year. Such, however, was not the intention of the rider, who has thus far covered a century each day from January 1st, through the most rigorous of winter weather, and undaunted by the blizzards and bad times generally that have prevailed. To ride thirty consecutive centuries at this season is enough; but to keep on riding 100 miles a day during the kind of weather that '98 has ushered in thus far is considered by the strongest of riders a herculean task, and to those who spin over the asphalt roads of summertime for a few miles each day, it seems beyond the bounds of possibility. As each day passes from now on, it will be of interest not only to athletes but to the public at large to note the daily performance of Edwards, to keep in touch with the time he makes, the way he performs his work, his habits when at rest, his method of keeping in the best trim, his weight, and a dozen other points in connection with the work of the new phenomenon.

18980211: II IXiA It ALL, Proprietor. "Is Wheeler quite a wheelman, isn't he?" Sprockett. "Nonsense! Why, he hasn't ridden a single century in a blizzard," Philadelphia Record. 

WABASH RAILWAY If you are contemplating a trip to the Klondike or any point in Alaska, please consider the merits of the great Wabash Railway, the short and true route via Detroit and Chicago, to all the gold fields of the far north. The Wabash, with its superb and magnificent train service, is now acknowledged to be the most perfect railway system in America. All trains run solid from Buffalo to Chicago, passing through St. Catharines, Hamilton, Woodstock, London, and Chatham. Detailed information will be furnished by any railroad agent, or J.

18980216: C: Butter During Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

The last few days a much lower temperature has been experienced in the United Kingdom, but nothing approaching genuine wintry weather has appeared. The blizzard in America may possibly foreshadow severer weather here, as much of our climatic change travels from the west to the east. The improvement in the demand for colonial butter noticed last week has still further developed, and business is active in the New Zealand butter market. Prices have risen about 1 shilling per cwt, on the week, which was foreshadowed a fortnight ago, when a rise was said to be within measurable distance. This has now come, but whether it will stay or not depends very largely upon the weather and the supplies during the present month. Both from Australia and New Zealand, there will be more butter than in February last year, but up to date the total arrivals for this season from these countries are respectively 101,110 cwts, and 31,038 cwts, while last season, to the same date, they were 108,663 cwts, and 23,274 cwts. The total Australasian butter arrived this season is 132,143 cwts, which is just 2,211 cwts in excess of the arrivals to the same date last season. While these figures are nearly equal in total, the quantities from each of the three principal colonies differ considerably: 

New South Wales: 73,641 cwts  
Victoria: 96,769 cwts  
Total: 1898 - 1897: 27,169 cwts  
10,517 cwts  
31,038 cwts  
23,274 cwts  
De 23,228 in 16,652 in 7,764. 

Thus, while Victoria has fallen off by 1,161 tons, New South Wales has increased by 833 tons, and New Zealand by 388 tons. The Copenhagen Committee has left the official quotation unchanged this week, and there seems a prospect of steady markets for some time to come. The settlement of the engineers' labor dispute has given confidence to buyers and brought a better tone to the market. A feature that is also strengthening the confidence of buyers is the comparatively short supplies. Compared with last year, the past eight weeks show a deficiency in the imports of 35,000 cwts, instead of an increase of over 35,000 cwts, which would be the normal rate of increase for the last four years. 

Cheese: The market continues very dull, and prices are rather easier.

18980311: "I'll take him at that price. Here's what I mean." Madden pulled out his bank roll and counted off the equivalent of $5,000 before we astonished the English owner had time to withdraw his offer. After the bill of sale had been made out and the deal was closed, Plat said to Madden, suspecting by this time that he was dealing with an American: "It is understood, of course, that this horse must not leave the kingdom. I am selling him on condition that he is to remain in England." "You're too late, my friend," answered the Kentuckian. "You have already sold the horse. He belongs to me now, and I am going to take him back to America." Madden arrived here with Warlock on the mail steamer City of Berlin, while the blizzard was raging in March 1888. Two or three months later he sold the horse for $16,000 to United States Senator Stockbridge and Samuel A. Browne, of Kalamazoo, Mich., where Warlock was placed in the stud. Fashion in the bloodlines of trotting stock changed with the rapidity of millinery in those days, and before Warlock had been two years at Kalamazoo, the craze for stallions of Electioneer and Wilkes blood reached high tide. The two $50,000 stallions, Anteeo and Bell Boy, came to the Michigan farm, and the bloodlike son of Belmont and Waterwitch had to take a back seat. He was sent to Kentucky and was for a time in the stud of Col. It.

18980323: "A FRENCH DEFEAT: An Expedition on the Island of Madagascar Meets With a Reverse." Paris, March 22: The 'Sicle' today says a French expedition sent against Bossirtrls, in the island of Madagascar, has met with a serious reverse, six officers and 100 men being killed. The insurgents, it is added, also captured a number of rifles and 128,000 cartridges. 

A Nebraska Blizzard: Omaha, Neb., March 22: A terrible blizzard prevails throughout Nebraska. The mercury has fallen 40 degrees. The wind is 75 miles per hour. Zero weather is announced for tonight. The storm is particularly hard on cattle and winter wheat. 

The severe weather is general throughout the West. 

Colder today with local snow flurries, say the probabilities. Toronto, March 22: It p.m. The low area which was approaching the Lakes yesterday is now central over western Ontario, and after showing some signs of dispersal, is again redeveloping. The pressure is giving way and in the latter district the extreme cold weather is giving way to higher temperatures. 

Minimum and maximum temperatures: Edmonton 4, 32; Qu'Appelle 12, 12; Winnipeg 22, 12; Port Arthur 6, 20; Parry Sound 34, 48; Toronto 36, 52; Ottawa 24, 40; Montreal 22, 42; Quebec 16, 40; Halifax 24, 60. Ottawa and St. Lawrence: Fresh to strong west to north winds; mostly fair; colder weather; local snow flurries moving. 

OBSERVATIONS TAKEN AT M'GILL UNIVERSITY. March 22: I P: 1 t ai "sb SIR" 2D 1 (McClellan) A RICHARDSON, Managing industrial specialties, and of over three points in the local traction specialties. Apparently, the volume of accumulation in the final hour was due to considerable short selling, as there was a tendency to rally on covering just before the close, but this rally was so feeble that the covering movement was given over and prices fell away to about the lowest at the close. The great bulk of the dealings was in Grangers, Union Pacific preferred, Sugar, and the local traction stocks. These railway stocks were affected by the reports of the blizzard in the West. Sugar continued depressed in the belief that the company was on the verge of a war for supremacy in the trade. But while these special causes had an appreciable influence, the shadow on the market was the developments of the Government's Cuban Policy, in which all circles feel a crisis is now imminent. Evidently, no one wants to buy stocks until this question is settled. Another feature of the day was a further announcement of gold engaged for import, and a concurrent easing of exchange rates. It was felt yesterday that the gold movement had probably come to an end for the present, and as this was believed to be due to a prospect of easier money rates, it was looked upon with favor by the speculative community. According to this reasoning, the resumption today of the gold movement might be regarded as an unfavorable factor, though the further influx of gold must make easier money, even though it is not the index that easy conditions have already arrived. The feeling in Wall Street was evidently intensified that the policy about to be announced by the Administration will involve hostilities with Spain.

18980324: "EIV33 ON THE RAMPAGE Have Demoralized Railway Traffic in the Southwest." Columbus, Ohio, March 23: The Cleveland division of the Big Four Railway, and the south line of the Columbus, Sandusky & Hocking were the only two of fifteen roads here that could move trains out of the city today. The system of levees which protected the west side of the city are undermined and are known to be badly broken in many places. These breaks permitted water to flow where it had not in perhaps forty years. People in these parts were slow in moving out or upstairs; there are now about 1,000 of them on upper floors of dwellings situated in an artificial lake. Men who worked all of Tuesday night to bridge and levees sent out messengers to warn householders, but many of them, considering themselves safe, remained at home. 

St. Louis, Mo., March 23: A regular blizzard prevails in St. Louis and vicinity, extending down into Arkansas and part of Illinois. The temperature shows a drop of 48 degrees since yesterday. The ground is covered with heavy wet snow, something unprecedented for this season of the year. The heavy rains of the past few days have caused all the rivers in Missouri to rise rapidly. The Osage and Gasconade especially are pouring floods of water into the Missouri. The gauge here is 4.8 feet higher than yesterday. It is expected that by tomorrow all low lands on the Mississippi as far up as the mouth of the Illinois river will be under water. At St. Charles, the Missouri has risen at an alarming rate, threatening to overflow a large area covering the best farming lands in the state. Only a few incoming trains reached Union Station on time today. The delays were caused by the washouts and landslides. All the streams about Nashville, Ill., are rising, and the Okaw River is on the rampage. Wheat fields are flooded, and the bottom lands north of Covington are submerged, the Okaw being five miles wide at that point. 

Middletown, Ohio, March 23: The Great Miami River is higher here than at any time since 1866. The state dam has broken, causing the hydraulic water to run into the canal. Its banks threaten to overflow into the streets. The breaking of the reservoir bank would undoubtedly cause loss of life. All the paper mills have stopped; water is ten or twelve feet in the cellars. No trains are running, and the city is shut off from all travel. 

Indianapolis, Ind., March 23: The reports coming in today from all over the state concerning the damage done by the floods will send the aggregate loss up into the hundreds of thousands; perhaps the figures may reach $1,000,000.

18980325: P spoke of the exhibition in question in terms which pointed at the mismanagement. The officials of the company were charged with selling to it, for the sum of $16,000, ground which had previously sold at $73,000. It was asserted that the people had no confidence in the company, and the Government was asked to take the exhibition under its own control. The Council also supported the Dominion Government's action regarding the San Jose scale and asked the provincial Government to imitate it. With regard to the maple sugar question, it was determined that efforts should be made to develop trade in it between this country and Great Britain, and the quality of some 66 percent alcohol made from the sugar was also very favorably reported on. 

Fablen Paquet, a bailiff, 76 years of age, fell a distance of fifteen feet from Regent Bridge, Montmagny, which is being repaired, to the ice beneath and died soon afterwards. Alexandre Bergeron, of Jonquiers, recently died suddenly between that place and Chicoutimi while driving a load of grain to a mill. 

STORM IN ENGLAND: Snow and sleet fell heavily yesterday. London, March 24: Snow and sleet are falling today in various parts of the United Kingdom, while heavy gales are sweeping the coasts and causing vessels to seek shelter in the harbors. A blizzard is raging in Derbyshire, imperiling the flocks and pedestrians. There were many small wrecks without loss of life on the east coast, and the steam trawler Nellie, which was wrecked off Rattray Head, lost all her crew by drowning. There have been gales, snow, hail, and blizzards throughout the country. At Birmingham, a factory wall was blown down, killing four persons. There have been numerous small wrecks. Seven men went down with the trawler Nellie off Aberdeen, despite the coast guards' efforts with rockets. The men apparently were too numb to seize the line. A yawl capsized off Howth, Ireland, and four were drowned. There has been a general dislocation of telegraph wires. From Marseilles comes the report that the French steamer Ludie has foundered with 30 hands. The Ludie belonged at Marseilles and was overdue from Constantinople.

**sing; is, to a certain extent, visionary. There is more disease and sickness wafted about on the gentle spring breezes than is carried along by the gales of a blizzard. "When Spring unlocks the flowers that paint the laughing soil," it also frees from the frozen clutch of winter the imprisoned germs of disease. Each melting pile of a winter's collection of dirt now exhales disease-ladened fumes. Your health, at this critical season of the year, depends on whether your system is strong enough and your blood pure enough to withstand the disease that lurks in the spring atmosphere.

**18980404: LIVERPOOL AND ISLE OF MAN. At Stanley market, supplies on Monday were about equal to those of the previous week. For prime cattle, full rates were paid, and medium sold more freely. Sheep were in reduced supply, and a few superior Cheviot hoggs made better prices, but otherwise the demand was slow. Prime, first class, 6d per lb; second, 4 1/4d; third, 1 1/2d. Mutton, Scotch, 8 3/4d to 6 3/4d; Irish, 8d to 6d. Cattle, live weight, 32s to 24s per 112 lb. At Birkenhead, business has been much worse, the heavy supplies coming forward both at Deptford and to the Mersey making it difficult to shift goods almost at any price. The best bodies of beef never made more than 9 3/4c, a lot of really good bullocks making only 8 3/4c, while cows and bull beef could hardly be sold at 6 3/4c to 8 1/2c. After the "blizzard" of Thursday night, prices looked like mending, but Friday's transactions do not appear to have shown any material advance. The sheep trade, though slow, has been ever so much better than for cattle, and good American sheep made up to 11 1/2c; Argentines, 11c; secondary descriptions of each making from 10 1/4 to 10 1/20, while inferior grades could be cashed from 9c to 9 1/2c. Fears are entertained that the terrific gales of Thursday and Friday will have caught some of the incoming cattle steamers, no fewer than five of them being due.**

**18980409: THINGS WRITTEN AS IF BY A MAN. Now that may be a startling statement for a woman to make, who, as a rule, is generally supposed to least want or play to be one. However, that may be true; I want to be a man: Why? Oh, for various reasons. If I were a man, I would want to show and still look like a man. If I were a man, I would throw away my skirts and strings and hairpins, and appear in public in a suit of the table and the cement, careening for the lord of creation alone. If I were a man, I could have a butchery all to myself and run in after midnight if I were a man—without creating scandal, or having all the other men in the house look frostily at me the next morning at breakfast. If I were a man, I could—yes, I could—smoke a finely flavored cigar after dinner and not speak of me as "that dreadful woman." If I were a man, I wouldn't be bothered with furbelows and flounces, and could dress in a jiffy, while now—well, that is a secret. If I were a man, I wouldn't have to sew on buttons, or darn stockings, or hire servants, or beg money to buy my Easter hat. Lastly and seventhly, if I were a man, I'd wear sweaters, and leathers, and things, and strengthen the muscles of my back and limbs by a little spin of a hundred miles or so per diem, just as Mr. Edward Edwards, the young Welsh cycle rider, is doing in Washington. Dear, dear, dear—what an awfully nice thing it must be to know that you are Adam instead of Eve! Even an Adam on the edge of the 20th century, who makes a "Century" all around the country on two wheels, and lords it over Mrs. Eve when he is at home, just the same now as when he made that seductive lady's acquaintance thousands of years ago in the idyllic village of Eden. But that is a digression. Consumed with longing for a new wheel, I called on the Welsh Record Keeper to see what he would say to a woman about his "centuries" and his wheel. Mr. Teddy was mounting his Columbia at the edge of the curb when I first saw him, and laughed uproariously. When he learned my mission, he stopped laughing long enough to dismount, and forthwith followed me most eagerly into Pope's beautiful bicycle parlors on Fourteenth street, where he let me in on himself. He was a little shy just at first, but he soon thawed and became chatty and entertaining. Now that is the advantage of being Eve. The few simpers I’ve felt truly is what she cares for. "I understand you weigh 120 lbs, Mr. Edwards," I began, giving him a critical newspaper-like glance from crown to foot. "But you are so broad-shouldered and solid, I'm sure you weigh at least one hundred and forty pounds." "Sweaters," laughed Mr. Edwards; "three sweaters." This was startling. "Sweaters?" I repeated feebly, with an amazed and perhaps reproachful inflection. "Sweaters?" The young man's brown eyes twinkled. "I have on three sweaters under my coat," he said, "and that gives the appearance of solidity and breadth you observe. My weight is really about 170 lbs, though few people believe it when they see me in my rig on a cold day. But I assure you the extra pounds I am accredited with are all due to sweaters." And he laughed again. This was rather difficult to believe in full view of Teddy's well-knit figure (I intend, I assure you), but of course I was too well-mannered to further doubt his word, and accepted his explanation as gracefully as possible. As Mr. Edwards has been making some remarkably bad weather centuries this winter, I was naturally curious being a woman to know how he dressed when equipped for his snowy and rainy day runs. For freaks and vagaries, and unexpected jumps and falls of the weather and the thermometer have no effect on Mr. Teddy's ambition or record-breaking efforts in the wheeling bite. He runs in all sorts of weather—rain or sunshine, being all the same to the sturdy young Welshman. "What do you wear?" "What do I wear?" said Mr. Edwards. "Now that is a woman's question!" and he laughed heartily. "When it is snowing or raining, or the weather is freakish in general, I wear rubber; an entire suit made of rubber—boots, rubber leggings almost up to the waist, and a rubber cape and cap, which has a long flap to protect my neck and ears and keep out the snow or rain. As for gloves, I wear rubber gloves." "A funny incident happened to me at Long Island in connection with my gloves." "What was that?" I asked, deeply interested. "Well, you know—rubber causes perspiration, and on this particular run, which was made in the teeth of a blizzard, the perspiration actually froze between my glove and hand, and I couldn't get the gloves off or even budge them. Before I could remove them, I was in quite a predicament."**

**18980423: "THE MAN WHO RIDES ONE HUNDRED MILES EVERY DAY." "The New York Journal" has dubbed Teddy Edwards as the man who rides a hundred miles a day on the bevel gear chainless bicycle. He passed his hundredth consecutive mark in New York on Easter Sunday with flying colors. Over a hundred of the strongest riders in the metropolis escorted Edwards on his centennial run, among them being Miss Nellie Pearson, the leading woman centurion of Greater New York, who rode side by side with Edwards during the entire journey. The persistence and unequaled endurance and backbone which marks the performance of this new prodigy is but a culmination of the perseverance he has been so noted for many years ago—plucky and energetic. Since then, he has maintained his resolve and has led his relatives and friends to throw up their hands in despair and predicted fatal results when he announced his intention of taking to the wheel. "Instead of killing me," as Edwards often says, "the wheel saved my life, and the more I rode, the healthier and stronger I grew." It wasn't long before ordinary loafing grew irksome to Edwards, and he joined a club, went on club runs, and began competing in long road races. He then grew interested in long-distance road racing and took to following his peers who were training for long distance events. At first, he was unable to keep up, and they laughed at him, but later he proved himself capable of holding pace, surprising those who had shortly before laughed at him. He has faced numerous difficulties since the beginning of his riding; on January 1st, Edwards has had innumerable difficulties to overcome, has pedaled through blizzards, snow plows, and sleighs, has been drenched in rain, and has come in contact with all sorts of difficulties on his daily rides. Personally, Edwards is quiet and unassuming. He goes about his daily rides in much the same way as the business man goes about his business.**

To observe properly the beautiful geometrical forms assumed by snowflakes, as they softly fall to the ground, requires that some means be adopted to prevent them from melting away during an observation, and generally that suitable appliances for viewing the flakes or crystals by means of reflected light be at hand. During a snowstorm, very many remarkable specimens of ice crystals can be conveniently collected on a sheet of black cardboard, and then rapidly photographed through a microscope, before there is time for any serious melting to set in. A description of numerous crystalline forms, obtained in this manner, is given in a recent number of the Popular Science Monthly, where it is pointed out that the best crystals are usually obtained during blizzards and storms spread over a considerable area. In the case of a local storm, the snow is more granular in appearance. Different storms afford different types of crystals, the internal markings upon which defy description, so complicated, regular, and beautiful are they. 

The judges of England, after considering the question for more than a year, were unable to agree on a definition of what a "place" is, and now the London County Council is obliged to ask legal advice as to the meaning of "street." The council recently summoned a man before a police magistrate for laying out a street on his property without obtaining the council's permission. His defense was that it was not a street, but a courtyard for the use of the tenants, and the magistrate said that he could not decide the point until the council's lawyers obtained an accurate definition of a street from a superior court.

Thirst is constant these warm days. It seems impossible to quench it. Ordinary drinks seem to aggravate rather than satisfy it, and too much liquid is bad for the stomach and general health. Salt makes a cooling, refreshing, healthful beverage. Take a teaspoonful in a tumbler of water two or three times a day and you will not be worried by thirst or heat. It is the most healthful and palatable beverage you can use during warm weather, everywhere at 60 cents a large bottle. Trial size, 25 cents.

N. Skinner, recorder of the city, has given a written opinion sustaining the common clerk's position. The remains of the late Miss Phinney, the Red Cross nurse, arrived at Richibucto by train this afternoon, accompanied by her brother who met the body at Boston. A large number of friends met the remains at Kent function and accompanied them to Richibucto. They were taken to the home of the deceased's parents where funeral services were conducted by Revs. Messrs. Fraser and Lawson, who also conducted the services at the grave. 

Mrs. Amy Blizzard, of McDonald's Point, Queen's County, will celebrate her 106th birthday tomorrow. Mrs. Blizzard was born in 1792, in the parish of Gagetown, Queen's County, N.B. Her father was Albert A. Kirby, of New York, and her mother Lucy Ward, of Cumberland. In 1811 she married Thomas Blizzard, of Cambridge, Queen's County, who died about thirty years ago. As a result of their union, Mr. and Mrs. Blizzard had sixteen children, eight sons and a like number of daughters. Ten are now living, seven of whom are daughters. The living are: Oliver Blizzard, born 1812, now living at Washacemoak, N.B.; John Blizzard, born 1817, now living at Indiantown; Thomas Blizzard, born 1831, living at Indiantown; Sarah Blizzard, born 1839, now living at Hallton, Me., the widow of Mr. Scribner; Fannie K. Hutton, wife of James Hutton, Narrows, Queens County, born 1832; Mrs. Mary Mead, widow, living at Indiantown, born 1814; Mrs. George Black, of Indiantown, born 1827; Mrs. Wm. B. Smith, of McDonald's Point, Queen's County, born 1830; Mrs. Thomas Watson, widow, of this city, born 1841; Mrs. Winifred Hutton, of Indiantown, born 1818. Mrs. Blizzard has nearly seventy grandchildren, and over a hundred great-grandchildren. While somewhat feebler than on her last birthday, Mrs. Blizzard retains a most remarkable degree of activity. Her sight is not much impaired, and her hearing is quite clear. With the exception of a slight trembling in her voice, her power of speech is good.

AN EXPOSED POSITION 

The ugliest spot in Atbara City was the War Correspondent's camp, where the only things that harmonized were dust and misery. For six days out of the week, a dust blizzard would strike the city, but its full fury would burst over the tented field of the Fourth Estate, uprooting their canvas coverings and impregnating their food and drink with the foul sweepings of the camp, making writing or sketching almost an impossibility. These sandstorms discount the pleasures of Atbara City for a summer or winter resort, for they rage in great fury at all seasons. They are also, no doubt, the primary cause of the considerable amount of sickness now at Fort Atbara. There is, apparently, no other reason, for good food is plentiful, and all water is purified by the most approved Birkeland nitrations, and last, but not least, General Oatacre does not allow the men to have much time for moping, what with fatigue duties and field days. Lately, on these field days, the British troops have been drilled in an old style of advance which was practiced in the days of Marlborough. In fact, I believe that the Lancaster Regiment fought in this way at Minden. Our men, while moving forward in line, will fire independently.

S TO TAKE IT 

Spanish Contention: That Conquest Brings Its Burdens as Well as Its Blessings. Paris, October 17. The Peace Commission will meet again Wednesday next. During today's session, the commissioners were occupied with the Spanish presentation of Tuesday last, and the American answer submitted on Friday, relating to Cuba and the debt of that island. The examination of the American written canvass on the subject was not concluded today, and will be concluded at the next jointure, following which the Spaniards will doubtless reply in writing, the conclusion of the subject soon following. The interchanges regarding Cuba are now so far advanced that the Spaniards will not fail to understand the United States' determination not to assume part or the whole of the so-called Cuban debt of four hundred million dollars. It should not, however, be understood that the Americans during the course of the controversy have been unmindful of certain local burdens, like the municipal obligations of the Cuban cities, railroads, and kindred properties, local and permanent. It should not be forgotten, however, that the American attitude in Cuba is held not to be that of an acquiring power, either of territory or of its real or constructive obligations. The opposing Spaniards keenly contend that sovereignty involves burdens as well as blessings, and that both should pass together from Spain. 

Closely following this contention, the Spaniards are pressing for a construction of the word "relinquish" in the Cuban article of the protocol. "We must," they urge, "relinquish sovereignty over Cuba; but to whom? We have not agreed to relinquish it to the Cubans; we relinquish it to the United States." Thus, crystalizing their reasoning and insistence, the Spaniards bind debt and sovereignty together, and urge that the relinquishment must be to the United States. While this contention is keenly and vigorously supported, it has not shaken the position of the Americans, who cut the thread of Spanish diplomacy in the middle of the word "relinquish" by practically assuring the Spaniards that they need not cherish anxiety as to whom to relinquish; but to conform to the fourth article of the protocol, which pledges Spain that Cuba, Porto Rico, and other Spanish islands of the West Indies shall be immediately evacuated. 

Strictly, the American response to Spanish diplomacy of construction and definition was that the words "relinquish" and "evacuate" are interchangeable and have the same meaning. Thus, three sessions were given up to patiently meeting Spain's views and contentions touching the protocol pledge to relinquish sovereignty and title to Cuba, and there is a possibility of two sessions more. 

Havana, October 17. The American military commission held a conference at their headquarters today. Rear-Admiral Sampson was present. Senor Guanta, secretary of the Spanish commission, presented the American commissioners an official note setting forth the times when the next detachments of Spanish troops will leave the island. It is reported here that many of the officers of General Gomez's staff have received leaves of absence, but it is added that they have really resigned, owing to serious trouble with their chief. 

Ponce, October 17. By permission of General Guy W. Henry, Colonel John R. Castleman, of the First Kentucky Volunteers, had arranged to assemble all the regimental bands to take part at noon tomorrow in the celebration at that place of the final and formal surrender of the island of Puerto Rico to the United States. The bands of the First Kentucky Volunteers, the Third Wisconsin Volunteers, the First Volunteer Engineers, and the 15th Regular Infantry were to play the "Star Spangled Banner" in unison immediately after the firing of 41 guns from the batteries. In consequence of the intense heat, however, General Henry, after a further conference with Col. Castleman, has decided not to allow a review of the troops, considering the enfeebled condition of the men, but there will be music and other forms of celebration. 

London, October 17. A dispatch to a London news agency from Paris says: Today (Monday) the conference reached a crisis. For the first time, Judge Day presented the demands of the American commissioners in intelligent words. He said that delay was the only possible object attainable by the persistent efforts of the Spanish commissioners to saddle the United States with the Cuban debt, and would be tolerated no longer, as the United States would neither assume nor guarantee any part of the debt. "The Spaniards replied that this placed Spain in a position of repudiation..."

ating or reducing the race value of the CuImiii bonds from (0 to ten per cent,, paying only half the stipulated interest on the reduced value. Before they would adopt either alternative, they would surrender to the United States the Philippine Islands. This resulted in a whispered conference, followed by a request for an adjournment in order to communicate with Madrid. Judge Sy said that President McKinley had instructed him to demand the entire surrender of Puerto Rico tomorrow (Tuesday), and the delivery of every town to the United States officers by midnight together with the evacuation of Havana on or before November 1 when the United States army would be at the gates of the city ready to take possession. There was no alternative offered in the face of either of these demands, and the session consequently was very brief. The American commissioners have received dispatches from Washington indicating that the administration is irritated and indignant over the delay of the Spanish commissioners.

THE FRENCH NAVY
A Mobilising Order Said to Possess but Little Importance
Paris, October 17 Enquiries made today at the offices of the French Ministry of Marine confirm the report, as published by the Havas, in a dispatch from Toulon, saying that Vice-Admiral Fournier, who is now at Tunis, with the Minister of Marine, M. Lockroy, will return immediately to Toulon, where orders have been received to speedily prepare the armored cruisers Admiral Trehouart, Bouvet, Jeminop, and Valmy for active service and that, in addition, orders have been issued to send the largest possible number of gunners to Brest, without delay, to man the fort and batteries there. The vessels mentioned are to be promptly placed on a war footing and are to be sent to Brest. Rumor connects the French naval preparations with the question in dispute with Great Britain as to the possession of Fashoda, on the Nile. The Paris papers today, in chronicling the movements of the British fleet in the Mediterranean, announce that three British ironclads are engaged in gun practice off Bizerte, the French naval station in the Mediterranean, on the African coast. Paris, October 17 A semi-official note issued this evening says that the statements to the effect that French warships which are being placed on a war footing have been ordered to Brest is incorrect, and it is added that undue importance has been attached to the incident.

A Missouri Snowstorm

The Latest in Telegraphy
The protracted study of duodecaplex telegraphy, pursued by A. Mercttdicr, the well-known French scientist, is attracting much attention in that country, as well as elsewhere. The report is that in experiments for some time past carried on along the Paris-Bordeaux line, twelve Morse transmitters are worked simultaneously on a single wire, each sending its signals to the proper receiver at the end of the line—a result attained by means of interrupted currents. That is, each transmitter receives its current through an electrically vibrated tuning fork, whose vibrations are of the period necessary to cause resonance in the proper receiving circuit, the latter having its self-indication and capacity correspondingly adjusted. The receiver, called a monotelephone, is also acoustically adapted for damping out undesired signals, the combination effecting so complete a sifting that only a slight and not troublesome murmur comes from the unintended signals.

The Pamir Blizzard
The buran, or snow hurricane, of the Pamirs is a meteorological phenomenon of great interest. A work by Sven Hedlin states that even in midsummer the temperature during a snow-buran frequently falls to 14 degrees Fahrenheit, while in the winter of 1892-93 it dropped to 45 degrees below zero at the end of January, and snowstorms were an everyday occurrence. The buran comes with startling suddenness, the atmosphere growing dark with whirling snowflakes where scarcely a minute before the sky was perfectly clear. It is impossible to see a yard ahead, and separation from one's caravan by even a few paces would mean almost certain death, for to shout is useless, and even the report of a rifle would be drowned in the awful roar of the hurricane.

A Scandalous Hymn
(Hartford Times) It is difficult to characterize fitly the so-called hymn sent out by the National Monument Association. It is bad in every way, but the worst thing about it is the impious comparison of our soldiers to Christ, in the lines:
"Spain's blood was of atonement
For ills that she had done,
And ours was sacrificial
As that of Thy Dear Son."
The Springfield Republican describes it in terms none too severe when it says: "The dominant note is self-complacence at having a 'pull' with the Deity, which leaves no chance for the other fellows, who say their prayers in Latin. The whole hymn is vile doggerel, gross in taste, impious and impudent."

Patrick's face was so homely that it had been described as an "offense to the landscape," and he was as poor as he was homely. One day a neighbor met him and said: "And how are ye, Pat?" "Mighty bad," answered Pat. "It is plastering that’s shtralin' me in the face." "Is that so?" said the sympathetic enquirer. "Sure, and it can't be very pleasant for either of ye."

Telegraph
A correspondent of Literature has answered the question which has been in so many minds since the publication of Kipling's "The Truce of the Bear" as to the meaning of Adam-sad. "Ad" in Persian means born, and "Adam-sad" means "Adam-born"; just as Shah-zada means king-born, Sahib-zada, lord-born, and the familiar Sheherazade, in the original "Chamber-sad," city-born. 

"I wish that young Softleigh wouldn't stare at me so every time we meet. It's dreadfully embarrassing."

New York and Boston Struck by a Blizzard

THE RAILWAYS BLOCKADED
New York Has to Go Back Ten Years for a Storm as Big and Boston to 1881 for a Comparison.
New York, November 27 When the people of New York awoke this morning, they found the blizzard that raged when they retired was still in progress. The storm, which had begun with the soft, sleety snow on Saturday, at noon had increased greatly, and with the heavier snowfall, the wind was blowing gale force at midnight. There was a slight abatement of the wind this morning, but the snow still fell and drifted high, and the temperature dropped rapidly. It looked this morning as though the blizzard would continue all day, but at 10 o'clock there was a breaking away in the west, a brightening of the light, and finally the storm ceased altogether, and the greatest blizzard since the memorable one of March 1888 came to an end. With the brightening of the skies in this city this morning came an increase in the velocity of the wind, and the loose dry snow was sent swirling and eddying everywhere. Nearly a foot of snow had fallen, but in places it had drifted to four and five feet. Broadway and all the great thoroughfares of the city presented a fantastic appearance. There were drifts on the sidewalks through which the early morning wayfarer ploughed to his waist. In some of the streets, great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity. As soon as there were signs of abatement in the fall of snow, the street cleaning department went to work. But there was very little progress made. The street railroad ploughs had thrown up huge banks of snow on either side of the rails, creating an almost impassable barrier to anything but sleighs, very few of which were out. The street cleaning department, with its limited resources, removed a few thousand loads from the principal thoroughfares, but this made an impression on the banks that was scarcely noticeable.

THE WEATHER
The recent comparatively mild weather which has prevailed in Great Britain has been interrupted by a thorough blizzard in many parts of the country, especially in the North, where the snowdrifts have been several feet deep. Three men perished in the snow in the Highlands, a train was blown off the rails near Tralee, Ireland, numbers of fishing boats have been lost, many fishermen have perished, and the Irish mail boats and cross-channel mail services were interrupted or seriously delayed. The Belfast mail boat was twenty hours in making a trip which is usually made in a few hours.

Acute Rheumatism
Pain in the Foot and Limb - A Complete Cure Accomplished by Hood's Sarsaparilla
"For a number of years, I was afflicted with acute rheumatism in my left leg and all the way down my limb into my foot. I live five blocks from my work and had to stop and rest several times in going and coming. I could get no relief from my trouble and was on the point of giving up my job when I happened to hear of Hood's Sarsaparilla. I purchased a bottle of this medicine and a vial of Hood's Pills and began taking them. Before I had half finished them, I was relieved, and it was not long before I was completely cured. I never lose an opportunity to praise Hood's Sarsaparilla, for my cure meant a great deal to me, as I have a family and must always be at my post."

"The Men Rollers," whose unfortunate experience with a Down East blizzard compelled the management of the Royal to close the theatre for Monday night, have finally reached town. They opened with a matinee yesterday. For their performance, standing room was at a premium. It is the best burlesque organization that has been seen at the theatre. The singing is good, and the specialties entertaining. Among the acts of note are the Washburn Sisters, who will be remembered by the house; Mackie and Walker, from "Nina," Fabriani and Catlton in their dancing act. Fresh from his Philadelphia success, he is dancing with much vigor. His many old Montreal friends turned out to welcome him. It is also a welcome news to the music-loving public of Montreal that Miss Jewell, of New York, is to assist the Zingari in a concert in the Windsor Hall on December 10. She became a favorite when she appeared with the Paul Jones company last winter, and her reappearance here as a soloist, after a year's hard work with the best masters in New York, will be the cause of pleasurable anticipation on the part of her friends.

The lightship was located off the New England coast at the eastern entrance to Nantucket Sound. It is probable that she lost her anchor during Sunday morning's blizzard, and she therefore drifted helplessly at sea for more than three days before being picked up by the Switzerland.

The sound of sleighbells has been heard in Lakewood, the semi-tropical winter resort in the belt of pines in southern New Jersey, for the first time since the famous blizzard of ten years ago. In other years, a few flakes of snow have occasionally passed the forest barrier, which hems in this pretty little village. Just enough of them to keep the natives informed of the climate of the surrounding country, and of the fact that snow is real and not the illusion of imaginative minds. But the only other time, within the memory of the oldest inhabitant, when enough snow fell in Lakewood to cover the ground for more than ten minutes was ten years ago, when the great March blizzard, forgetful of the privilege of the resort to remain immune from the blasts of winter, swept down upon it and buried it under a foot of snow. Among the recent arrivals at the Lakewood Hotel are: Mr.

1898-12-16: ELECTION JUDGE'S JOURNEY. He Travels 1,080 Miles to Carry the Returns to a Minnesota County. Duluth, Minn., December 10. The little angle that sticks up from Minnesota into Canada has an election precinct, though it hasn't much else. It is inhabited by a few fishermen, and at the last election cast eleven votes. It is no joke to get the return from such a precinct when the elements do not favor, and this year they did not. On election day, there was a blizzard, with high winds and a severe snowstorm. William Zipple, Judge of Election, walked ten miles to the polling place, and with the other judges counted the eleven ballots that were cast. To him fell the chance of carrying the returns to the county seat, Bemidji, about 100 miles south, but with only one connection, and that across the Lake of the Woods, eighty miles, on the Canadian Pacific road to Winnipeg, 100 miles, and south to Duluth, 800 miles, and from there to Bemidji, 100 miles toward the starting place. It was in all a journey of 1,080 miles to get from an outlying precinct of the county to the county seat. Zipple started the day after the election with his eleven votes safely wrapped up, and the little steamer on which he was traveling had not run twenty miles up the lake before the sharp ice had cut a hole in her, and all hands, including the Election Judge, had to man the pumps. They kept at this work for about thirty hours, unable to make a head against the water, and in almost hourly fear of sinking. Finally, another steamer came along and everyone was transferred to it. The journey to Rat Portage was then continued without incident. In thirty-six hours thereafter, Zipple had arrived at Duluth with his ballots, but found that the road to Bemidji was blocked by wrecks of wheat trains and would not be open for twenty-four hours. He finally reached the county seat. Democratic candidates for Attorney and Auditor had been confident of their election by a majority of 7 votes. Zipple's precinct had given the Republican candidates all but two of the eleven votes, and the complexion of the county was changed. This Election Judge was ten days away from home, had traveled 1,080 miles, was once shipwrecked, and once delayed by wrecked trains.

1898-12-24: P., who advised the sojourn in a milder climate, Mr. Arthur Weir gives some of his experiences on the trip to and while residing in California. It consists of six chapters headed, respectively, On the Trail of the Voyageur, Across the Prairie, Over the Divide, In Arcadia, In the Sierra, Roughing it, and a dialect ballad "Derringer Dick, the Bicyclist." Narrative, conversation, reflection, and poetry succeed one another in these pages and the reader, not without amusement, obtains a good deal of information about people, scenery, and usages. Residence in the south is not all pleasure either to the Canuck or to the native. "When a San Franciscan sees the sun, he thinks he has discovered a comet, and the Los Angeleno will write a column editorial and half a dozen sonnets on a shower of rain one could carry in a bucket. And the biggest newspaper in the southern counties will publish his efforts. But I am not surprised at this. After one has lived some months in southern California, a vague dissatisfaction permeates his soul, and it finally dawns upon him that a continuity of fine days is monotonous. When day after day, week in and week out, the sun shines, the flowers bloom, and the birds sing, the stranger finds himself praying for rain. Then he prays for snow, and as the Land of Sunshine continues to verify its name, he gradually increases his demands until he is importuning heaven for hail, wind, cyclones, blizzards, tornados, waterspouts, cloudbursts, anything in fact which will afford a change of weather even at the expense of all his wife's relations." There is, doubtless, some exaggeration in the foregoing lament, but there is also, no doubt, enough of reality in it to show that there are worse places in the world, take it for all in all, than this Canada of ours. Those who wish to have a picture of southwestern life taken at first hand will find it in Mr. Weir's little book. It may be obtained from any of the booksellers.

Here is a story of cycling the like of which may never have been told; it is the story of a race that began in Manhattan Borough, as the bells of the metropolis were welcoming the new year and ended in Tarrytown, twenty-seven miles distant, ten and a quarter hours later. It is the story of a struggle on wheels against wind and storm and snow in which all but one of six competitors finally succumbed to the blizzard, and that one, after many vicissitudes, arrived exhausted at the goal.

1899-01-07: THE GAZETTE MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 7, 1891. A DOUBLE HEADER. Intermediate Players at Work for Championship. THE VICTORIA'S WIN EASILY. Montreal Defeats McGill. Skating, Curling, and Miscellaneous Sporting. The blizzard last night kept many people away from the Arena. It was a night to stay at home and look for hockey later on, and notwithstanding that... Here is the corrected text:

There was a double header in the Intermediate championship series. The number of spectators was not large and was almost lost in the vastness of the rink. The first match was disappointing in a couple of ways. It was too one-sided; it began late; and it was marred by accidents. Hockey is a great game; a most lively and interesting game, but it has time limits, and from the advertised time of 8 o'clock until the halting idea of when a new day is beginning seems almost too long. A couple of hours of hockey should be good enough for anybody on a cold night, especially with a melancholy streetcar ride in prospect to cheer one up after it is all over.

The proceedings were opened up by the Intermediate teams of the Shamrocks and Victorias facing each other. The contest was a ridiculously easy one for the Victorias, who seemed to have an intermediate team that would "do credit to seniors." It will be worth watching how many of these Intermediate players will figure on the senior seven before the season is over. But that is neither here nor there just now. The Shamrocks were outclassed at every point in last night's match, and early in the game were badly disabled by the loss of Hutton in the nets, who was severely cut by a flying puck. After his retirement, Brennan was put between the posts, but he did not seem to be suited for that position, while the Victoria attacking line played a combination that it would have been difficult to withstand even with more experience.

It would be useless to go into the details of this match. The Shamrocks saved themselves from a whitewash in the first half, the score standing 8 to 1. In the second half, the Victorias added another 8 goals to their list, and the Shamrocks seemed to be demoralized. Lack of team play seemed to be the principal issue with the Shamrocks.

February 14: B. B. Hughes, a well-known citizen, and who with his brother, Patrick, at one time ran a large wholesale dry goods store on Tonge Street, died at his residence, Jarvis Street, this morning. Mr. Hughes had a fainting fit two or three days ago, but as he had been in good health previously and rallied afterwards, nothing was thought of it. However, heart failure supervened and Mr. Hughes succumbed to it.

A GREAT BLIZZARD

Extended From New Orleans to New England Coast

CAUSED MUCH SUFFERING

Trains Stalled, Business Abandoned and Great Discomfort Was Particularly Severe in New York

New York, February 13 - New York is almost snowbound. Traffic, which was light today on account of it being a holiday, will necessarily be so tomorrow. The snowstorm which began Saturday night today developed into the worst blizzard in the city's history. During the day, a northwest gale blew through the snowbanked streets at the rate of 25 miles an hour, driving the fine, icy, blinding snow before it. Great drifts piled up in the principal thoroughfares and traffic on all the streetcar lines in the city, except the Broadway and Third Avenue lines, was practically at a standstill. The underground trolley lines were forced to stop early in the evening and only a few crosstown cars, drawn by four and six horses, made occasional trips. The railways running into New York are paralyzed. The Pennsylvania attempted to get but one train through to the West today, while only one train from this city reached Washington. Local traffic has practically ceased. Disasters in the ice-filled harbors and rivers have multiplied. The huge drifts in the streets have produced a coal famine in parts of the city where it is impossible to make delivery. Coal, flour, and staple provisions are rapidly going up, gas and water pipes are frozen in many parts of the town. The suffering from cold has never been so widespread in this city, it being estimated that at least 60,000 persons are in misery from cold and destitution. 

New York is the storm center, or rather the center of two opposing storms, one from the Gulf of Mexico and the other from the northwest. The storm which developed in the Gulf region Saturday night moved in a northerly direction. Another storm started on the Canada coast and met the one from the south over this city. The temperature is not so low as it has been, but the wind, which sends the blinding snow into great drifts along the thoroughfares, makes up for it. At no time since midnight Sunday night has the thermometer risen above nine degrees above zero. The ferry traffic to Jersey, Long Island, and Staten Island is uncertain. Both the North and East rivers are filled with floating ice and navigation becomes hourly more difficult. The high Brooklyn Bridge is taxed to the utmost by the heglira from the ferries. The bridge trains are packed like sardines. The bridge is 30 inches higher in the center than normal, on account of the contraction of the iron and steel work. Chief Engineer C. C. Martin says it is not in any danger, however. 

WORSE IN BROOKLYN

In Brooklyn, traffic was effectively blocked at 11 o'clock. All the lines of the Union Electric Railway were stopped, and most of the streets were impassable to vehicles. The East River is frozen solid from Riker's Island to Oak Point, while Long Island Sound is filled with immense blocks of ice and vessels that attempt to navigate its waters are in great danger. Brooklyn is in worse condition than any other part of the greater city. Harlem is suffering intensely. This is the great flat section of the city and many of the buildings have thin walls. It is almost impossible for their tenants to keep warm, and the discomfort of residents in that section of the city will increase to positive suffering with the continual diminution of supplies of fuel. 

So far, the local telegraph and telephone wires are in fairly good shape. Communication with many outside points, however, is cut off. The elevated railways thus far have maintained a fairly good service. The trains are jammed with people, as this is the only sure means of transportation left in the city. The streets are deserted. No one braved the storm tonight unless compelled to do so. The horseless cab was in great demand and coped successfully with the blizzard. The theatres were poorly attended and many dinners and meetings were postponed on account of the storm. 

By order of Governor Roosevelt, all the armories in the city, excepting the 7th Regiment armory, were thrown open to the homeless poor tonight. Many churches were also thrown open, while all of the charitable organizations opened all the rooms they could obtain for the shelter of the unfortunates. Many places of refuge have been provided by the Salvation Army and the Volunteers of America; all of the hospitals and charitable institutions and the police stations in the city are crowded. 

February 13: A snowstorm which started this morning early developed during the day into a veritable blizzard, a west wind driving the fine dry snow in all directions. At six o'clock tonight, the street surface cars, the only means of travel, were only running at fitful intervals. The storm is continuing, and by midnight there will be no means of travel except by foot. Trains on the New York Central and Delaware and Hudson Railways are from two to four hours late, and each succeeding train is a little later than the other. The Empire State, from the West, was one hour late here, although strenuous efforts were made to keep it on time. Supt. Harrington of the New York Central received instructions from New York at 1 o'clock to discontinue all trains on the New York Central running south and west. The Empire State left here one hour late and was stalled after crossing the bridge. An extra engine was sent after her, and she was brought back to the depot where she will lay until the road is opened. 

The coldest weather ever known in Kentucky was recorded today. At Louisville, the thermometer only reached 10 below, but the state suffered much more. Lebanon showed a temperature of 39 below; Carlisle, 30; Princeton, 30, and the highest recorded in reports from 26 stations was 13 below. At Paducah, a negro woman and her child were frozen to death in the field. In many towns, business has been suspended and a coal shortage is reported from all parts of the state. The Ohio River is fast freezing. 

Atlanta, Ga., February 13: The temperature here today was 8 1/2 below, recorded officially. This was the lowest ever known here, the previous being 9 1/4 degrees. Street thermometers record 10 and 12 below, and this temperature, accompanied by a wind which showed a velocity of 13 miles an hour, made the cold almost unbearable. Great suffering was reported to the police early in the day and prompt measures were taken for relief. Fifteen and a half below is reported from Anniston, Alabama. 

IN BOSTON

Boston, Mass., February 13: The regular old-fashioned snowstorm which has been raging throughout New England since early Sunday morning increased in intensity today and by night had developed into a blizzard with the usual accompaniment of stalled railroad trains, paralyzed streetcars, and a general blockade. The storm, following the severe cold wave of last week, seems to have been a fitting climax for the severest weather that has been experienced in this region for many years. The main storm began at an early hour this morning and since then it has snowed incessantly, while the northwest gale at times reached a velocity of over 60 miles an hour. The steam railway companies wrestled all day with great drifts, but by night the train service was practically suspended throughout New England.

February 15: BIG STORM ENDED. People to the south of us are busy shoveling snow. New York, February 14: With clear skies and warmer weather, New York slowly started to dig itself out of the snow this morning. The great blizzard of 1899 had gone as quickly as it came. There was not a cloud in the sky, but underfoot lay 15 1/2 inches of snow on the level with drifts ten feet high in many places. Meanwhile, the great snowstorm has blown itself out to sea. It left the entire country between Maine and Florida buried in snow for 1,000 miles inland. Virginia felt least its fury with two inches of snow on the level, and New England experienced most of its vigor with 18 inches, New York being a good second. The snow fell short by six inches of reaching the record made in this city by the great blizzard of 1888. Then the snowfall was a fraction over 20 inches. Barring that mighty storm, this blizzard is the worst in 20 years according to the records. After Saturday's half-holiday and suspension of business on Sunday and Monday, today's street traffic was tremendous. Result: blockades everywhere. There was no place to go save along the car tracks. On either side of them, the roadways in all the streets were heaped high with snow thrown there by the car sweeper and piled there by the workers. The railroads running into the Grand Central station did not make much progress in restoring order from the chaos into which the blizzard had plunged them. While their officials were very hopeful that they would be able to establish some kind of a train service tomorrow, they were obliged to admit that no through trains had passed over their respective lines since Monday. Five hundred men were struggling with the great drifts in the Grand Central yards all day, and late this evening it was announced that all the tracks were clear. The New York Central continued to be tied up all day as far as incoming trains were concerned. The great drifts 30 miles south of Poughkeepsie, at and near Cold Spring, were too much for the snow plows, and trains were massed at both sides of this point in large numbers. 

St. John, N.B., states that at dark yesterday, the steamer Utspesia had drifted about three miles westerly from the position in which she was reported early in the day, when she was lying faint in the sea, many miles off the Îles de la Madeleine. Before dark yesterday, she was showing a three-flag signal, thought to indicate the condition of the ice, as this signal means "General communication." A danger signal would be made with two flags. 

St. John's, Nfld., February 14: Captain Kelaney, commander of the steamer Bruce, a powerful iceboat which runs on the winter mail service between Newfoundland and Cape Breton, believes that there is no doubt that the Canadian Here is the corrected text:

---

**Ian Liner Gas Deal** is in a dangerous predicament in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, owing to her not being fortunate to contend with ice floes. He believes she may remain frozen there for weeks unless the winds change, loosen the floes, and so enable her to escape.

**NUMIDIAN DELAYED**  
The Allan Line yesterday received a telegram from its agents at St. John informing them that, owing to the blizzard that was then raging in St. John, the Numidian could not sail. A later dispatch at 4 p.m. reported the weather was clearing and the steamer would sail at high water, 2 a.m. today. The Japan mails, for which the Numidian has been delayed, were expected to reach St. John at 7 o'clock last evening. The train had been snowbound.

**NEW YORK:**  
New York, February 14. Stocks today advanced moderately above the prices prevailing before the triple holidays. Commission house business was much restricted as the severe weather delayed mail orders and kept away many customers. The attendance on the Stock Exchange was diminished, and prices receded fractionally during the early trading. The London market, too, was dull because of storms throughout England, and "Yankee" rails, which showed weakness before opening because of the blizzard, were subsequently bought for London account. Burlington was a most prominent stock for strength on a rumor that a refunding plan would be put through at tomorrow's meeting, although the story lacked confirmation. The other Grangers were sympathetically strong. Weather conditions were responsible for lifting prices of the anthracite coalers and rubber. The improving tone, which became noticeable before noon, spread to the rest of the market as a rule, and values were generally enhanced. Other features of strength were the local traction shares, the Pacifics, and Pennsylvania. The effort to secure dividend payments through legal proceedings was responsible for some advance in Pittsburgh.

**LONDON:**  
New York, February 14. The Commercial Advertiser financial cable from London says: "The markets here are very idle and dull today. Paris sold heavily on unconfirmed rumors of riots there. American stocks opened heavy on the blizzard in America, and the New York money outlook and prices dwindled steadily all day. There was little business, and what there was had no feature. Coppers were feverish. Tintos touched 41 6/8 and closed at 40 1/2. Anaconda were 9 8/16 and closed at 9 8/8. Utahs were 10 1/4 and closed at 9 9/18.

**18990221:**  
A.M. Stevenson contended that the council should not be called on to consider a question that the Finance Committee had considered and rejected. Aid Beausoleil urged that no financial obligations were involved in his motion. It was simply asking for an expression of opinion. He was not asking for any expenditure. 

A busy scene ensued, half a dozen aldermen in various parts of the council chamber addressing the Mayor and each other in a mixture of French and English, creating quite a babel of sound, which culminated when Aid Stevenson’s stentorian tones were heard demanding how any such movement as that suggested by Aid Beausoleil could be expected to be carried out without money. “How,” asked Aid Stevenson, “could the council discuss a scheme of the cost of which they were in absolute ignorance?”

The Mayor ruled the motion in order as no expenditure of money was involved by it, and no one, when the monetary side of the subject came to be discussed, would be in the least pledged to support expenditure by reason of his vote today. Aid Jacques moved, after a lengthy animated, but uninteresting debate, that the whole question of the enlargement of Bonsecours market be referred anew to the Market Committee. This was seconded by Aid Gagnon and carried by 16 votes to 8. 

Aid Licorne moved that it be well understood that the motions voted to certain employees for horse keeping entitle them respectively to such motions annually, and that this council forbids any additional expense for this object in any manner or for whatsoever. Aid Ekers seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously, and the council rose after six o'clock.

Was it a joke on the part of some wag or was it confusion? That was what the Police committee at a meeting last night could not quite decide. The patrol wagon at No. 4 station is in need of repairs, the cost probably 40 or 145. The committee did not think it worthwhile to advertise for tenders for so small a job, and the secretary was instructed to write to the following persons and ask them to state for what amount they would make the repairs: T. Trudeau, R. Peschers, Bernard Major, J. Norman-den, and B. Ledoux & Co. Five letters were received apparently in response, each marked on the outside to the effect that they were tenders for the repair of the patrol wagon. When the first envelope was opened, the chairman, Aid Marsolais, drew out a piece of blank paper. “Well, well,” remarked the other members, laughingly (Aid Ames, Jacques, Cleart-hue, Lareau, and KinscWu), “that’s funny.” The chairman then cut open the second envelope. “Any better this time?” asked someone as Aid Marsolais proceeded to unfold the contents and lay them on the table. “Well,” observed Aid Jacques, as he slowly held up the piece of paper, “it’s got a little more on it.” It was a half-sheet of ruled foolscap. The committee had a good laugh. “Somebody’s having a joke; it’s the joke of some wag,” said Aid Ames. Then the other envelopes were opened, and each had the same contents: a piece of blank paper. Aid Jacques then spoke in favor of Mr. Normandeau, who, he was quite sure, would not be a party to such a trick, as he had seen Mr. Normandeau, and that gentleman had told him that he had too much work on hand to entertain any tendering for these particular repairs. But there were five envelopes, and five people had been asked to tender; how did that come about? Aid Jacques reasserted his belief that Mr. Normandeau was not one of those who had done such a trick, and Aid Lareau was just as certain that neither was Mr. Trudeau one of the guilty persons, for that gentleman had informed him by telephone that he did not think the job was big enough to tender for. Someone suggested that those who had been asked to tender had told somebody else, and that it was the latter who were guilty of the joke. Aid Ames pointed out that the handwriting on many of the envelopes bore considerable similarity, as if they had all emanated from one source. Anyhow, if each envelope had been sent by a different person, these people must have conferred together as to what they would do. He regarded it as simply a protest to endeavor to thwart the committee attempting to have the work done by open tender and contract, and he considered that the only thing to do was to let the matter rest for a week so that the committee could make inquiries as to whether the persons written to had agreed whether or not they would have anything to do with the job. If they had agreed in the negative, the committee could get the work done elsewhere. The committee had thrown away thousands and tens of thousands of dollars in the past by not having work done by contract, and there was going to be no more of it if he could help it. If the carriage-makers who had had a soft thing out of the committee could not treat it in a proper manner, it could go elsewhere. The matter was deferred for a week in accordance with Aid Ames' idea.

The auction of calling for tenders for police clothing was then taken up, Aid Ames submitting a number of specifications that he had prepared in reference thereto, going into the most minute details regarding the quality and making up of the cloth garments. He explained that he had drawn up these conditions in order to protect the committee as far as possible and to make sure that the men got goods of the same quality as the sample. There are 6 officers on the force and 332 men, and it was decided to call for tenders for outfits for three numbers, more or less. Aid Ames suggested specifications being slightly amended to the effect that a deposit of $1,000, in the form of an accepted cheque, must accompany each tender for uniforms, and an accepted cheque for $100 must accompany each tender for each other article; that all goods shall be cut and fitted to measure for the person for whom they are intended; that all garments shall be made up within the limits of the city of Montreal, and the standard rate of wages paid by the contractor to the persons employed in their manufacture; that summer goods must be delivered by June 15th, and winter goods...

**Lakewood in the Blizzard**  
Lakewood H. Klmii Jr. will give their first entertainment on Thursday night. There has been so much traffic over the undulating drives in the pine forests by sleighs of every imaginable style and size that the snow is packed firm, and in going in consequence is perfect. The blizzard evidently cleared the air. The atmosphere has been delightfully clear and pleasant since the big storm, and the sleighing has been perfect. A marvelous or the telegrammed cavalcade of sleighs that makes the circuit of the lake and Pine Park could not be imagined, let alone described. Some idea may be gained from the fact that everything in the shape of a vehicle or box has been placed on runners and is now doing duty among the Russian droskys and the perfectly appointed sleighs of the millionaires.

**Boomed the Lawson Pink**  
The editors of several of the metropolitan newspapers have written editorials expressing their wonder at the large amount of free advertising obtained by the Lawson carnation, and wondering who the man was who had been so successful in obtaining publicity for the pink. The man who did it was Cleveland A. Chandler, a bright newspaper man, society editor of the Boston Globe, and also connected with the N.W. Humphrey Company, one of the prosperous advertising agencies of Boston. Mr. Chandler has proved himself a most ingenious press agent, and one whose efforts in arousing public interest should place him in the class with Joseph Leiter's press agent. Since the publication of the matter concerning the Lawson pink, the florist who has them for sale has been inundated with orders to such an extent that he has been utterly unable to fill them. The above article was published in the **Fourth Estate** of New York, **February 9**.

**LEGAL INTELLIGENCE**  
**SUPERIOR COURT JUDGMENTS**  
Montreal, February 20. By Mr. Justice Davidson. O'Toole vs. The City of Montreal. On the afternoon of the 23rd of February, 1898, the plaintiff's wife fell and fractured her arm while walking on the sidewalk which runs along the south side of the northern part of Victoria Square. Damages to the extent of **$372** were claimed. Both on this and the previous day, the weather had been unsettled, and sidewalks, to be properly kept, required close attention. At the spot where the accident happened, the sidewalk was in a markedly bad condition. All through the day, passersby had been slipping and falling there; neither of the defendant's men, who usually have the care of the square, was on duty. One of them, Morgan, had finished his working turn of duty the day before. Immediately after the accident, Flnnegan, a carter on the adjacent stand, who had noticed the number of falls that had occurred throughout the day, tried to find a city employee, but without success. In respect of this particular sidewalk, there rested upon the defendant something more than the superintendent's and inspecting care which it exerts over the sidewalks of citizens. Here the clearing and safe maintenance of the sidewalk were immediately upon the city. Negligence existed in both respects. The damages claimed were reasonable. The plaintiff kept a boarding house, the success of which had been largely due to his wife's personal and active supervision. She was no longer able to work. The loss was fully what the plaintiff asked, and judgment was rendered in his favor for **$372** and costs.

**McKiernan vs. The City of Montreal**  
The plaintiff sued for **$1,000** damages alleged to have resulted from a fall on the sidewalk. About half-past 9 o'clock in the evening of the 3rd of March, 1898, the plaintiff left his residence, No. 42 St. Antoine Street, to visit a friend, and within a few feet from his doorway fell and broke his leg. He was picked up by three persons who happened to be close at hand and was taken to the hospital. It had thawed during the day and frozen during the evening. The sidewalks throughout the city were, as a result, in a very slippery condition. One of the witnesses stated that he said to his friend, immediately after the accident, that it was easy for anyone to fall that evening. It was not shown that any particular defect existed in the sidewalk at the spot where the plaintiff fell. Negligence on the part of the defendant had not been established. It was utterly impossible for the city to have all the sidewalks throughout the city immediately sprinkled with ashes if frost in the evening followed soft weather during the day. Every person who happened to be injured by a fall on the streets in the winter season was not entitled to damages, although an impression to that effect seemed to exist. The circumstances of this case were quite different from those which led the court in the previous case to award damages to the plaintiff O'Toole. If the city in these cases were to call in the owners of the sidewalks as defendants in warranty, there would be a marked difficulty in proving their liability to justify damages. The action was dismissed with costs.

**Roy vs. Martin et al. and Hodge et ux. Intervening**  
The plaintiff by his action asked that a certain lot be divided, if found practicable, into three parts, and if such division were not found practicable, that a licitation be ordered. An intervention was filed by the intervening parties, claiming that they were the owners of the two lots of land in question. The court maintained the intervention.

**Merchants Bank of Canada vs. Graham**  
The action was for **$12,442.67**. The plaintiff alleged that by deed of **16th December 1890**, A.C. Stead Strap, a stableman, Mr. Hwrty R. Drummond, Miss Charlotte Russell, Miss May E. Reynolds, Martha Bun, her maid, Mrs. Cecil Gordon, Mary Anne, Miss Wolferswn, Thomas Jane, Miss Bruncnaud, Mattie, Miss M. Monk (Maids at the Hall), Miss Abbott, and 1 du Dommaine announce the fourth of their series of vocal and instrumental recitals for this evening. It will be held at the Art Gallery. The news that Max Heinsch is to be heard in Montreal again this year will be very welcome to the musician's large personal following. With the assistance of his daughter, he will give three recitals, Friday and Saturday evenings, and Saturday matinee. The next concert of the Symphony Orchestra is announced for Friday next at **4:30** in Windsor Hall and will, doubtless, be looked forward to with pleasant anticipation by all those who have enjoyed the preceding concerts. The standard of music rendered is a very high one, and at the same time the variety of the programs is such that it is likely to suit all tastes. Prof. Goulet and the musicians who play under his leadership are certainly deserving of congratulation. Seats may always be reserved in advance at Shaw's music store.

**Melodrama** is holding forth in all its glory at the Queen's Theatre this week, in the shape of a production of **"The World Against Her"** with Agnes Wallace Villa as the star of the aggregation. "The World Against Her" is not new. For some years, just how many is not recorded, the heroine, whose woes form the basis for five acts of dialogue, scene shifting, and gesticulation, has been going up and down the land, making her troubles hum to a sympathizing populace. And Agnes Wallace Villa plays the heroine. She played the part in such a manner as to send a large number of ladies home with their handkerchiefs in an exceedingly damp condition, owing to Agnes Wallace Villa's objections to parting with her child. The supporting company is equal to the demands made upon its members, and generally speaking, the audience seemed to be satisfied.

This week's bill of fare at the Théâtre Français is the farcical comedy **"Confusion."** It is a comedy in every sense of the word, and there is such a series of complications that the audience is kept in one continual roar of laughter from the rise to the fall of the curtain. To witness yesterday's excellent performances, which were full of ginger and humor, one can hardly imagine that the same members were playing last week serious parts in a still more serious drama. But such is the case. As Christopher Blizzard, Mr. Walton Townsend displayed a splendid piece of character work, and it helped considerably to keep the audience in good humor. Special commendation is also due to Thos. J. McGrane, Morris McHugh, Miss Esther Moore, Miss Nellie Callaghan, and Miss Charlotte Deane. The comedy is made additionally pleasing by the pretty and effective stage settings.

The vaudeville portion of the performance contains three good turns. John Zimmer moved himself—a juggler of no mean merit—and was followed by Dot Read in Highland dances. Her work is graceful. Ely and Harvey gave a clever and somewhat original sketch, entitled **"William and Mandy."** 

**The Butterfly Burlesque** took possession of the Theatre Royal yesterday afternoon and will remain there for the rest of the week. The performance consists of seven vaudeville turns and a burlesque which is called **"The Sultan's Dream."** The vaudeville portion of the entertainment is good, especially the Eldridge, a colored team, and Frabel and Bugs, in a comedy aerial act, which it would be hard to equal. The burlesque serves to introduce the usual number of chorus ladies and the principals who had been seen already in their specialties. Altogether, it is a show that should do good business. **"The Turtle"** will be seen in this city on Monday night for one week at the Academy, and from the interest already evidenced, a good engagement of the season is anticipated.

**1899-02-22:** A.L. Whitelaw, by a narrow margin, won the election. The results were as follows: Dr. Douglass, Liberal and Radical, **6,723**; Mr. Whitelaw, Unionist and Conservative, **5,364**. The Liberal and Radical majority was **359**. The Conservatives are greatly disappointed as they had counted on winning the seat; whereas, they are defeated by an increased Liberal majority.

**Created a GOOD IMPRESSION in Paris Yesterday**  
Paris, February 21. President Loubet in his message submitted to both Houses this afternoon, said the regular transmission of power to the new President proved France's fidelity to the Republic, at a time when certain misguided persons were seeking to shake the confidence of the country in its institutions. The President dwelt on the necessity of appeasement, union, and respect for the essential organs of society: parliament, the magistrature, government, and the national army. He concluded by recalling the work of the Republic, which he asserted assured liberty and peace, founded a great colonial empire, and concluded alliances and precious friendships. The Chamber of Deputies was crowded when Loubet's message was read. It was greeted with applause. The House adjourned until Friday. The Senate received the message with similar approval and passed the credits demanded to defray the expenses of the funeral of the late President Faure. Wild rumors are also afloat as to the doings and intentions of the...

In a few days he had secured 1,000 cases, or 30,000 dozen, and now he has the market cornered. Before coming to Pittsburgh, Miller went out among the poultry farms and found that the hens had been frostbitten during the blizzard. As it takes them several weeks to recuperate, Miller says eggs will be selling for a nickel a piece before Easter.

**MARINE MATTERS** - 

18990304: **STATE OF TRADE**  
Spring Trade Opening  
It is well across New York. Bradstreet's of tomorrow will say: An enlarged volume of spring trade, particularly in dry goods, due to spring weather, special strength in the demand and price for cotton fabrics, an increasing and urgent call at soaring prices for iron and steel and all its products, and substantial advances in wages, chiefly affecting the above-mentioned industries and benefiting, at a conservative calculation, 100,000 operatives are among the features of the week, going to show that the producing elements of the country's population are sharing in the present favorable conditions. From many cities, east and west, come reports of an active demand from jobbers for spring dry goods. From the cotton manufacturing industry of the East come reports of activity, inducing manufacturers to grant advances to their operatives while the list of advances in prices of iron and steel products, whether crude, manufactured, or even old material, is a virtual roll-call of that industry's products. An encouraging feature is the small number of strikes for higher wages reported, partly owing to advances being already conceded as a result of walking scale agreements, the only important labor troubles being reported in the coal mining industry in the Southwest. Additional proof that the export demand for our steel manufacturers will be checked by recent and pending price advances is not lacking. In the lumber trade, the producers are likely also to reap a long-delayed reward as buyers become familiar with the fact that available supplies, whether of hardwood, white or yellow pine, or spruce and hemlock, are well controlled, while the outlook for building trade activity is favorable. Our export trade in cereals is recovering from the check administered by recent frigid and stormy weather, but reports of damage to the winter wheat crop on the one hand and estimates of superabundant supplies of old crops in farmers' hands have about balanced each other with a slight advantage as regards prices secured by the bears. Prices generally, aside from the exceptions noted, show few important changes. Corn is slightly higher, while oats are fractionally lower. The movement of cotton at the south has proved smaller than anticipated, and as the current consumption is heavy, both at home and abroad, quotations are slightly higher. Talk of new combinations in many lines of trade continues active, but signs are not wanting that promoters find it harder to place shares of companies not widely known. Bank clearings at the principal United States cities for the week ended.

February 28. The oldest inhabitant is in high favor in the Land o' Pines just now. He redeemed himself during the recent blizzard by predicting an early spring. The blue jays he gave as his authority. A number of these shy and beautiful birds hovered around the Lakewood Hotel, uttering plaintive cries for food when the storm was at its zenith. To those who live in cities and were visiting Lakewood for a change of climate and rest, it appeared that the birds had been merely driven into the pale of civilization in search of food. The natives, however, despite the fact that the thermometer was hovering around zero, and the ground was buried with the deepest snow ever seen in this delightful region, saw in the visit of the birds a sure harbinger of an early spring. Another sign was the arrival of grey squirrels. Those pert little animals left their hiding places in the depths of hollow trees in the loneliest parts of the forest and capered around the hotel to be fed by the guests. In a few days, the snow vanished, and the mantle of spring is now upon the Land o' Pines in earnest. 

The past week has been one of the gayest in the history of the Lakewood Hotel. The hotel has been taxed to its utmost. There was no dearth of amusements provided for the guests. On Saturday, Gerard-Thiers and his company gave a delightful concert in the hotel music room. This was followed by the regular Saturday night hop. There were sacred concerts by Carl Wenzel's orchestra in the main hall on Sunday afternoon and evening. The Princeton University Banjo and Glee Club took possession of the music room on Tuesday, and a well-attended entertainment was the result. The annual Washington Birthday ball, the last of the season's series, was given by the Lakewood Hotel on Wednesday night. This event attracted social celebrities from all parts of the country. The ballroom was tastefully and patriotically decorated for the occasion, and a more beautiful sight than it presented while the ball was in full blast could scarcely be imagined. On Thursday night, the children's amateur dramatic association gave an amusing performance. The Lakewood foxhounds will resume active operations on Tuesday. They will meet at Farmingdale on that day and at the Lakewood Hotel on Saturday. The golf links are not at their best and will not be for a few days yet, but the enthusiastic golfer need not be idle in the Land o' Pines.

**PROVERBS AND SIGNS**  
Forecast of the Future  
From the Month Just Passed (London News). The art and life of weather lore are entirely superstitious, and that which is based upon natural observation. In the interpretation of many weather signs, they often differ, but upon one point, they are in universal and emphatic agreement, and that box is in condemnation of warm weather in February. We had better not begin, therefore, to congratulate ourselves too soon, as many people are doing, upon slipping through the winter so easily. So far, the temperature of February has been mild. The usual announcements of early blooming roses and spring flowers have arrived at their customary time. It is only a malicious device of winter for forcing on the growth of the year to a point at which it can be destroyed by frosts and northeasters in April and May. "All the months of the year curse a fair February," says the old English couplet. "One would rather see a woman a peasant in his shirt sleeves in February," is the German proverb. "A warm February makes the usurer merry," is the French version, and a more homely expression of the same idea is now buying unw in many English rural districts that "when the cat lies in the sun in February, she will creep behind the stove in March." But there is no need to go to weather lore for a condemnation of warmth at this time of the year. Anyone with eyes in their head can see very plainly the mischief that is going on in field and garden. All kinds of growth have been fostered into untimely forwardness during the past few weeks. Everywhere the buds are unfolding. The silly leaflets on bush and tree are throwing off their protecting sheaths. The fruit buds on pear and plum trees have their leathery brown husks swollen till the creamy white undersurface shows. Unless a severe check of frost or harsh wind comes at once, they will be in a sweet state to meet the nipping airs, without which we never get through March and April. The minute dash of hail will ruin them. The blossoms that venture out cannot go back again, and if it leaves its sheath at this early date, it holds its promise of a summer life by a very precarious tenure. Its chance of developing into fruit is barely one in a thousand, its likelier fate being a shriveled death within a week or two of its venturing out. The experience of last year is worth noting; January was exceptionally warm, and the first half of February was delightful. "Ah," said some, "this is splendid; we are getting over the winter delightfully." Then came the northeast winds at the end of February, blizzards that destroyed all the premature growth, and the temperature that delayed the coming of spring till well into June. "Spring in February means winter in May" was certainly the fact a year ago.

But there are exceptions to every rule. Let us hope that this season will be one of them. An old coal-gravedigger was remonstrated with one day at a funeral for making a Barton's overcharge for digging a grave. "Well, ye see, sir," said the old man, in explanation, making a motion with his thumb toward the grave, "him and I have had it for two or three years now, over a braw watch I sold him, and I've never been able to get the money from him yet. 'Now,' says I to myself, 'this is my last chance,' and I'd take it."

18990320: THE GAZETTE MONTREAL, MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1899. NEWS FROM OTTAWA The New Governor-General's First Drawing-room FEBRUARY TRADE RETURNS Imports, Especially of Pre Goods, Continue to Increase, While Exports Decrease. Minor and Personal Notes Ottawa, Ont., March 19 - (Special) The blizzard, breezy, sleety snowstorm which raged all yesterday in Ottawa, resumed business after midnight, and has been hard at it all day. It very politely gave itself a rest between eight o'clock and twelve last night, which was very convenient for the seven or eight hundred ladies and gentlemen who attended the first drawing-room of our new Governor-General in the Senate chamber last evening. The function was one of the most brilliant of its kind ever held in Ottawa; a very noticeable feature being the large number of visitors from places other than Ottawa, especially cities, of whom there were nearly one hundred. The reception lasted exactly an hour and ten minutes, which is nearly a quarter of an hour longer than last year, when, contrary to the usual custom, the last drawing-room held by a Governor-General was the longest of his term. This was a reversal of the general order of things, the first drawing-room of a new Governor-General being usually the longest of his term. Last night the desire to pay respect to the new representative of Her Majesty seemed to be exceptionally strong, and the result was that the attendance was greater than any I can remember, with the possible exception of the first drawing-room held by Her Royal Highness, the Princess Louise, just twenty years ago. The handsome chamber of the Senate looked uncommonly well last night, brightened by the brilliant uniforms of the headquarters' staff, the official dresses of the ministers, judges and other officials, and the magnificent gowns of the hundreds of ladies who adorned the galleries and the raised platform at the sides of the chamber, with their youth and beauty. But one fault in the chamber was made very evident, and Mr. Tarte will have to see that it is corrected before another year. The fault is that the chamber is not sufficiently lighted, and that the style of lighting is altogether behind the times. An iron hoop, with a hundred little gas burners stuck in it, may be a very good style of lighting for a circus, but is somewhat out of place in the handsome chamber of the Senate of Canada. The fact that the gas was not lighted rather added to than detracted from the unsightliness of the gas fixtures, and the electroliers, although they gave a fairly good light, were not sufficient to make the chamber as brilliant as it should have been. The Senate chamber used to appear very light, but in comparison with the Commons since the new system has been introduced, it looks dim, and more light and better fixtures should be provided. The Premier was prevented by indisposition from being present, but the ministry was represented by the following members, all of whom, with the exception of Sir Henri Joly, wore their official uniforms: Sir Richard Cartwright, Sir Louis Davies, Sir Henri Joly.

"Ten Irishmen who had not met for years ran across each other in Derby; after a period of handshaking, they adjourned for many moist congratulations. 'Long time since we met, ain't it?'

SEAL HUNT OF '99 The Most Successful Trips for a Dozen Years NEWFOUNDLANDERS ARE GLAD The Sir Donald's Curious Adventure Floated From Labrador to St. John's. "From our own correspondent." St. John's. "The official summary of this year is the most successful within the last dozen years. Not only have the weights and quality of the seals been better, but there has been no loss of vessels, and, as far as known, not a single life has been lost by accident or sickness. What a contrast to last year, when the appalling disaster of the steamer Greenland occurred, in which forty-nine men met an awful death in a blizzard on the icefield. This year the weather was propitious; and a few days after leaving port, the greater portion of the sealing fleet struck an extraordinary patch of seals, and without much trouble or any mishaps, the bulk of them had only to slay and put the seals on their vessels, and return to port. On the 1st of the month, the first of the seals were seen, and on the 11th, the Aurora, the leading vessel, set sail."

18990705: GEORGE AND THE DRAGON A writer, who evidently knows his subject thoroughly—not by hearsay, but by experience—discusses in Blackwood the value of Wei-Hai-Wei. The policy by which it was acquired and the terms by which it is held, he does not approve of. Its seizure was the result of surprise. That Russia would eventually occupy Port Arthur was looked upon by those who had been watching events as fairly certain, and yet the occupation came so suddenly that it proved almost as disconcerting as if such a thing had never been contemplated as possible. The British Government, through the press and otherwise, let the world know that Russia's action had flurried it. For a time, there was a great deal of talk about the open door, and then, a squadron having been sent to Cheefoo, over against Port Arthur seventy miles off, Wei-Hai-Wei was taken possession of, and a clause was inserted in the lease that England would hold it as long as Russia remained at Port Arthur. What that means is not hard to decipher. It was authoritatively given out that the Government intended to make Wei-Hai-Wei a secondary naval base. Under certain circumstances, such a course might be wise enough; but, in view of the fact that Russia is rapidly turning Port Arthur into a first-class fortress, with an absolutely impregnable harbor capable of sheltering 100 torpedo boats or 50 destroyers of the "Sokol" type, such a policy would be a grave strategic error. In fact, Wei-Hai-Wei is worse than useless to England unless a defensible harbor is constructed there and the island adequately fortified. If the necessary breakwater were commenced at once, all that could be effectively accomplished before Russia could have her strategic railways completed and be ready (if such action were deemed advisable) to begin an advance upon Peking. The writer in Blackwood admits (though not without sarcasm) that Lord Salisbury may have information of which he knows nothing, but he has no faith in secrecy or the pretense of it in these days of an ubiquitous press. The question in which the Empire is concerned, especially that important portion of it that is interested in Chinese trade, is whether the Government really purposes to defend the trade interests of northern China. If so, the policy indicated may have its use. Now, moreover, is the time to act, when Russia is in a peaceful mood and friendly, her strategic railways being still unfinished, and Port Arthur being dependent on the sea routes for its supplies. What about the climate of Wei-Hai-Wei? It would be an insult to that future stronghold, says the writer in Blackwood, to compare it to Hong Kong, and it is not hot and relaxing like Yokohama. In fine, he believes it to be the healthiest in the world. Spring and autumn are magnificent. There is adequate rainfall, plenty of sunshine, and though the four months' winter is cold, it is a bright, clear, dry, bracing cold, with neither rain nor fog, and but little snow. Still, he mentions occasional blizzards—an average perhaps of one a fortnight—which sometimes bring a little snow and blow from the west round to north. While these blizzards last from one day to three days, the air is keen and cutting, but quite dry. The weather between blizzards is compared to that of the Riviera in winter and even superior to it, being drier and more bracing with more brilliant sunshine. We have outlined only the practical features of the article. Lord Beresford's proposals are condemned as dividing the powers of civilization into two great hostile camps. But he considers China's disintegration as only a matter of time. The great wall of exclusion is a thing of the past. The era of the railway has begun. The remotest interior will soon be open to foreign trade. England must share her monopoly with others, but she has held her own before under unfavorable circumstances, and she need not despair now. The proposal to give the Northwest half-breeds another issue of land scrip may be in the interest of somebody, but certainly it is not in that of the half-breeds. After the rising of 1885, a commission was sent up to settle the 'bleeds' claims with scrip, and most of the stuff passed into the hands of speculators within a few hours of issue. It cost the Government a large sum and did the recipients the least possible amount of good. It will be the same with future issues. The half-breed does not take to farming and does not need land; else he could get all he wants on the same conditions as white settlers. He is a picturesquely decaying survival of a past time, and to pamper him is to waste money. The English landlady who refused to serve a feminine cyclist because she wore bloomers has been paralleled by a landlord who had a lady ejected by the police because she persisted in smoking a cigarette. He also prosecuted her for disorderly conduct in refusing to leave the premises when ordered. The magistrate dismissed the summons but held that the landlord was right in making and enforcing a rule against ladies' smoking, as it "might tend to make the lewd and less thoughtful members of society rather inclined to joking." And this, while it may tend to promote morality in public, seems to be somewhat like punishing a woman for man's rudeness.

18990814: "O, nor her uncle would sanction any breach of a law which, though unwritten, was more binding than that of the Medes and Persians. Chance brought them, however, into unavoidable contact. Alison was a great favorite with the children of some of the humbler dwellers in the Valley of the Lea, and it happened that she had been visiting Patsey Daughty, a little invalid to whom her presence was a ray from heaven, on the very night fixed for a great Fenian celebration. With those who knew her, she was quite safe, but among the crowd that shared in the mock funeral and followed, with due manifestation of indignant grief, the six coffins, there were many strangers, some of them pretty rough and most of them no better for liquor. Alison was exposed, therefore, not only to inconvenience but to some danger, and it was with a throbbing heart that she recognized the uniform of the 193rd on a man who seemed to be pushing his way towards her. It was the color-sergeant. The walk home offered opportunities of which, after a thrilling silence, the lovers availed themselves. And it was as the strains of the Wearing of the Green from many bands and thousands of voices became less and less distinct that Alison heard the despairing avowal of the man who loved her. Here is the corrected text with OCR errors fixed:

Her it was an avowal and a farewell. He was going away to a new land and he said as he had often sung: "Bid me Good-Bye, good-bye, love." But fate intervened. Deacon, blind with rage at Ellerton for attention to his Norah, filed, as he thought, at that officer and for weeks the color-sergeant lay at the point of death. His parents were sent for, the address being found on a letter that he had written, and thus he entered upon a new stage in a career of which his service in the ranks had been the least faulty period. The disclosures that followed and the colonel's interest in them, Alison's serene joy at her lover's recovery, and all the other sequelae of this crisis we leave to the pleasant quest of the reader. Besides Alison Drew and the sergeant, the latter's father, an old friend of the colonel's, his mother, who becomes the patron saint to the regiment, the colonel himself; Alison's uncle Major Henniker and his wife and daughters, the younger, a baby, one of the special charms of the book; Drummer Coghlan and "good Eliza," little Missy's nurse and nurse's beau, Shadrach, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; Coghlan's pet marmosets and Missy's joys; Norah O'Connor, Deacon's sweetheart, a girl of rare beauty and goodness, who enters a convent after her hapless lover's death; Dr. and Mrs. Musters, Ensign Green and his brother officers Blizzard, Verrinder (Elsie Henniker's lover), and Dennison, Tim, little doomed Patsey's brother, Hospital Sergeant McMurdoch. In every one of these characters, there is something that impresses one with a sense of reality. As a military drama, the story would be a success. It is dedicated to "the dear and precious memory of one who died in a far-off land, September 1892." Colonial edition: (Jarrold & Sons 10 and 11 Warwick Lane, London)

18990829: COURT STOPPED FOR RACES. Point Pleasant, W. Va., August 28. Tiro-o KiliKKnrd of the Jackson County Circuit Court, who owns one of the finest strings of racehorses in this section of the country, has, it is alleged, a practice of adjourning court regardless of the number of cases on the docket, whenever any of his horses were entered for an important race. At the brief term of court held at Ripley this month, the Bar Association held a meeting and expressed its indignation at such methods in a series of resolutions, which, after citing the occasions upon which the court had adjourned "without good reason or excuse," protested against such a policy as "unfair to the bar, burdensome to litigants, unjust to witnesses, unreasonable to the clerk, and dangerous to suitors." The protest closes as follows: "We believe a public office is a public trust, and that offices are created for the benefit of the people and not for the convenience of those who hold them." Judge Blizzard is a unique character and has gained much notoriety by his manner of conducting his court.

18990929: D., September 28. The fiercest September blizzard within the memory of the oldest inhabitant of the Red River Valley is now raging. Rain began to fall early yesterday, and about dark last night it turned to snow. The ground is covered, and snow is falling, driven by a severe Northwest wind. 

STOMACHS THAT WON'T WORK, That Retain the Food and Refuse to Digest It, Make the Head Heavy and the Nerves Weak, Need Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. There is a cure for dyspepsia. Sufferers who have tried noxious nostrums will probably be skeptical, but skepticism vanishes when Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are tried. Whether the trouble is dyspepsia of long standing or merely a simple case of indigestion, relief is prompt and pronounced. The less the trouble, the fewer tablets need be taken. Heaviness after eating, sour stomach, as indicated by belching, fatigue with slight exertion, or with no exertion at all, disturbed sleep, nervousness, constipation, depression, "blues," these things can commonly be set down as symptoms of dyspepsia. And dyspepsia is merely indigestion in an aggravated form. By promoting perfect digestion, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets produce strong nerves, restful, refreshing sleep, pure blood, and good, sound, healthy flesh. They make the skin clear, the eyes bright, the mind cheerful. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a medicine and more than a medicine. They digest the food and make it easy of assimilation, and they relieve the inflamed, diseased condition of the membranous linings and the glands of the stomach and bowels. They help the digestive organs over the hard places and put them into a healthy, active condition. They effect a quick and permanent cure. You don't have to continue taking them forever, still it is well to have a box handy, and take one at the first return of the trouble. Perfectly well people are made sick by eating too much or unwholesome food, but not if they take a tablet after eating. Treatment with Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets does not necessitate dieting or any change of habits. They digest the proper food and act upon the other kind in such a way as to make it pass off quickly and harmlessly. You may eat and drink what you like, when you like, and as much as you like if you take a tablet afterward. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold by all druggists at 50¢ for a full-sized package.

F THE BOER WEAKNESS. Calculations are appearing in which the whole male population of military age in the Transvaal is spoken of as available for field service, and as the force which the British troops, if war breaks out, will have to overcome. The nature of the conditions under which the Boers live enables their Government to gather a larger proportion of the people into the fighting line than is usually the case. But it does not give any such force as many calculate on. The Transvaal is open in daylight from three sides, and through its territory, besides Johannesburg, are several large English communities, which will require the watching presence of considerable Boer corps. Many passes will also have to be watched, as the Boers will not be sure from whence attack will come. Even with the Free State's aid, it is doubtful if the Transvaal generals will be able to assemble in any one place, or to maintain for any length of time brigades of more than a few thousand men. There is no Boer commissariat and no hospital service such as a protracted struggle would render necessary. There are already in Natal two British brigades, complete in infantry, cavalry, and artillery, quite as strong as any Boer army that could likely be kept long in the field. If there is war, and, unfortunately, it seems too likely, the Boers will learn—and that quickly—that the detachments they triumphed over in 1880-81 were not the strength of the British army, and that their cause today is a hopeless one. Windsor, during the recent school discussion, was frequently pointed to as a city where Catholic and Protestant dwelt together in educational unity, and as a sample of what would be the rule in Manitoba when the Martin-Sifton anti-Catholic school law was fully in operation. The attention drawn to the Windsor plan seems to have been the presage of its death. Bishop McEvoy, who has spiritual oversight of the Windsor Catholics, has condemned the mixed schools and demands for the children of his flock separate institutions under Catholic control, and evidently means that his demands shall be complied with. It is a pity that what in so many ways is a good thing should not longer exist as an example of what should be. The Ontario Government, it is said, will intervene to prevent the production of its members' telegrams in connection with the North Waterloo election case. Why a Government should object to its messages on public business being made public is not at once perceived. It is not well, though, that telegrams should be too easily obtained in connection with court proceedings. A man's message sent over the wires should be as secret to outsiders as his letter sent through the mails. The ordering of the Grenadier Guards from Gibraltar to Natal, on the day of their intended departure for home, looks like the first part of the answer to the Orange Free State's declaration of sympathy with the Transvaal Boers. It is another indication that those who know most of the situation are among those who see least hope of peace in it. It looks much as if England would soon have on her hands wars both in South and North Africa. The Governor-General has decided not to go to the laying of the Chicago Government building corner stone. Whatever the cause, it is probable that nothing will be lost by his absence. There are occasions when the head of the country's government may properly appear at a demonstration in another country, but the Chicago corner stone laying is hardly within the category. The Chinese members of Admiral Dewey's ship's crew have been decorated with medals voted by Congress in commemoration of the victory in Manila Bay; but they cannot legally land on the shores of the country whose battle they helped so well to fight. This continent's race prejudices produce some curious complications. Aldermanic candidates, some good and some indifferent, are beginning to crop up. It is in its way a good sign. Electors need not, however, be led into hasty promises to aid the early applicants. Sometimes the latecomer has the most advantages. Dewey has called a lion cub presented to him Chichester, after the captain of the British warship Immortalité, with whom he was brought into frequent contact at Manila. These sailor men have queer ways of paying compliments to each other. They are suffering from blizzards already in Dakota. Probably old Boreas is trying to offset in the West the wind raised about Dewey in the East.

18991123: CHICAGO. Chicago, November 22. Wheat was firm early with Liverpool, but weakened on liberal receipts and report of a large shipment from Duluth to this port, closing 1/4c to 3/8c under yesterday. Corn, influenced by heavy clearances and interruption of the movement, closed 1/8c to 1/4c higher for December; May, unchanged. Oats closed unchanged and provisions 2 1/2c lower. Primary receipts were 749,849 bushels, compared with 1,076,155 last year. Northwest receipts were 634 cars, against 681 last week and 328 a year ago. The Northwest 1898 receipts were curtailed by a blizzard. Local receipts were 47 cars, 19 of contract grade. New York reported 25 loads taken for export. Atlantic and gulf port clearances in wheat and flour were equal to 639,000 bushels. The leading futures closed as follows: Wheat, December, 66 7/8c to 67c; May, 71 1/8c. Corn, December, 32 1/4c to 32 7/8c; January, 31 7/8c to 32c; May, 33 1/2c. Oats, December, 23 1/8c to 23 1/4c; May, 24 3/8c. Cash quotations: Flour, steady; No. 2 wheat, 63 1/2c to 65c; No. 2 red.

1899-12-21: A WORD FROM WINTER. The slaying, "And a-straying With the zephyrs I have been, I'm a sprinter. Wild old Winter! With a bound is coming in. I will humble men who crumble at my "antics" when pipes burst. They'll know whether Spring-like weather in mid-winter is the worst. When the plumber (Plumbs, o'er Summer) would seem welcome; when he's paid, empty purses will bring curses that I stopped my masquerade. Will the growlers and the howlers, all the folk who on me frown, like me better when I fetter ev'ry way, and wires are down? I'm a "guy-er," myth and liar. I'm a "freak, a fraud, a cheat;" thus they've volleyed; yet, if solid facts, I'll prove the most concrete. They'll remember this December about April next, mayhap, when my 'blizzards freeze their gizzards while I linger in Spring's lap! M. HARRY FURNISS ON CANADA Mr. Harry Furniss, the artist and caricaturist, has been to Canada and in the Windsor Magazine, out today, he has an interesting article illustrated with his own sketches on his impressions of Canada. Departing from his accustomed satirical style, Mr. Furniss describes all he saw and learned of Canada in the sober spirit of one who has been impressed with the enormous capabilities of the country and the vision of the future which is in store for it. "It is," he says enthusiastically, "a fine country, a country of the future, a country for the young and vigorous. It has endless resources, and above all, a charming climate." He makes it plain that in the matter of climate, "Our Lady of the Snows," has been sadly misrepresented. He found Canada in January milder than the sunny south of France. Having testified to his pleasures and amenities of Canadian life, he turns seriously to discuss the question which to Canada is the most serious of all questions: Why is it that the development of Canada proceeds so slowly? With wealth enough in fertile lands, minerals, and forests to maintain a population of one hundred million, the Dominion today has less than six million. This has puzzled Mr. Furniss, who, while avoiding the vexed questions of trade regulations, seems to point out that Canada's chief hindrance is the lack of good markets. The Nova Scotian farmer cannot go into the nearest big city, Boston, with his produce because of the hostile tariff. It is the same with the miner, and the iron and steel manufacturers. The same trouble meets the farmers and manufacturers of the Northwest and British Columbia. So much has this been felt, continues Mr. Furniss, who quotes the experience of Canadian farmers, that over one million Canadians have been forced to give up their land and homes and emigrate to the United States. There must be something wrong in the fiscal policy which makes it imperative for so many to leave their own rich country for the blizzard-swept states of Minnesota, Nebraska, and Kansas. Allowing for the fact that better times in the last two or three years have brought many Canadians back to their own country, there is yet much that ought to be done in the work of building up a great and powerful dominion. The immigration of the Scotch crofters, the Irish farmers, the English yeoman, to help fill up the great empty country should be pushed more vigorously than it is. This British immigration, and the further encouragement of trade exchange with the Mother Country, should be the foremost policy of Canadians today.
