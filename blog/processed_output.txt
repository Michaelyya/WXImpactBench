18820822: THE TORESTEY CONGEESS The first meeting of the Forestry Con grass in this city yesterday was an event of no slight importance for Canada, and one which, if we may judge by thointer-!-t generally taken in the discussions, will be productive of pood results It sometimes requires not merely counsel, but a certain degree of agitation to convince convince people that they are running risks, or that they must take measures to protect protect their own interests The vast and manifold subject 'on which the members of the Congress undertook to throw light yesterday is one with which the press, both on this continent and in Europe has been dealing for years, and which has again and again been earnestly debated in isolated societies It was, indeed, to the reading of a couple of papers on English English timber at the Institution of Surveyors that tho Empire to which we belong was indebted for the first real awakening of interest in the condition of its great forest resources at homo and abroad In those papers reference was made to the report of a commission on the state of the forest areas of Franco, and it was sumiested that a series of similar reports on the forests of other countries in both hemispheres would bo of great practical value A number of questions were accordingly prepare J by the Institution above mentioned in conjunction conjunction with the oflico of woods and forests and forwarded by the Colonial Secretary to the various colonies and de pendencies ol the British Crown Tho collection of tho replies took considerable considerable time, and their arrangement in a readable form was a work still more tedi ous It was not until IS7S, therefore, that an analysis of all the returns relat ing to colonial timber was published The result of the inquiry was certainly of a nature to surprise, if not alarm, those who had hitherto believed that tho sup plies were inexhaustible In some cases, in our own land, in Australia, in the West Indies and other countries the destruction had been simply wholesale, and, in hardly any instance (the Province of Quebec, wo are glad to say, being one of the excel tions) had any measures been adopted to arrest waste or protect against fire Since then a movement has been on foot, or which the Congress now in session is one of the outcomes for the devising of such plans as may put an end to the old injurious, injurious, slipshod system and the ravages which it occasioned or permitted As we have already said, the subject is one in which the whole community is concerned, but it is well known that what is everyone's everyone's business is mostly relegated to no person It was necessary, if any right steps were to be taken, not only that the authorities should move in tho matter (and our own Provincial authorities have shown the desire to do all in their power), but that some of tho more prominent men of business interested in the lumber trade should unite with men of science and others of intelligence and public ppirit to set an example- of practical concern and wise provision to the people at large Mr Little, the Vice-President Vice-President of the Congress, was among the foremost to advocate forest conservation and repair in the Dominion, and to him and other enlightened men who attended the Cincinnati convention, Montreal is indebt ed for the privilege which it now enjoys of being the seat of the Congress The list of papers to be read was a formidable one, and to do them full justice would demand a longer time than the Congress had fixed upon for its sessions-Some sessions-Some of them were strictly botanical, such as Dr Mohr'g treatise (as it may be called) on the "Distribution of Hardwood Hardwood trees m the Gulf Kcgion of the Southern States," a paper of considerable considerable research, but too studied and long for a mixed audience, for tho most part in search of practical information Another paper of the scientific class was that of the Kev Mr Fyles,ofCowansville, on " Borers in Forest Trees," in which he gave some valuable information regarding the evil work of the phylloxera on the wild vines of his neighborhood, and in which and the ensuing discussion some interesting comparisons were made as to the proceedings of insects destructive to apple, maple, beech, locust and other trees in different localities Mr Fyles was disposed to think that it was only diseased trees that wore attacked, while other gentlemen thought that even tho healthiest attracted the little depredators depredators The specimens and drawings with which the paper was illustrated, illustrated, made it one of unusual interest The suggestions of Mr Foy, of Wood's If all, Mass , for the preservation of forests against firs, which will be found in full elsewhere, are well worthy of attention, and the " block system " will, no doubt, form a feature in future experiments in forest reform Mr Thompson, of Preston Lake, Dakota, will read a paper to-day on 41 Shelter-beds," which, it was suggostod in advance yesterday, would form admirably admirably effective means of defence against the cutting Northwestern blizzards Mr Hicks' paper on the " Commercial Value of Pruning " was as practical in the reading reading as in the title, which suggests the preventable loss, in the production of depreciating knots, caused by its neglect neglect Mr

18821017: " MONTREAL, TUESDAY, OCT, 17 A LIBEL ON THE MOBl'HWEST About as cool a piece of misrepresenta tion as we have met with in a long time is contained in the following extract from " The Settler's Guide to the American Northwest," issued in the interest of the Northern racific Railway Company " The width of country In which the wluter climate maintains Is limited Up In Manl toba, In the Canadian Dominion, Is a wholly different condition The excellent line of the Canadian Pactflo Railway, as projected, was changed for the worse to the south, in the vain hope to get away from frosts in July ana au trust The climateof Manitoba cmshts of seven months of Aretie winter andflve months of cold weather And Manitoba is a country of spring floods which drown out all the farms In all the valleyB Her principal river has the peou' llarity of running from the south in the United States straight north The mouth of the Bed River is frozen solid when the head and raid' die of the stream are broken up and running swiftly under the southern spring warmth The ice dams at and around Winnipeg in a vast obstruction like a mountain barrier, The water sets back and covers all the surrounding court' try, drowning stock, floating away dwellings, buildings andences, and driving the farmers qft to the tops of hills to save their lives, So is with Canada's rivers which flow from the west eastward, tributaries to thlsRed River They all rise in the Rocky Mountains Th temperature ol the footrhills of this range being warmer than the open plains of water' soaked Manitoba, all tbose streams In spring commence running ice at the head before they open at the mouth The consequence is floods which annually desolate Manitoba and keep the people who have been coaxed Into it anxious, poor and sick Tls a pity that Canada Is so cold and so subject to tie annually drowned out; for It has a belt of wheat land extending to the Rocky Mountains as rich as any land south of the International boundary line " Ten years ago such a description of the Canadian Northwest might have met with credence; today it excites only smile of derision on this continent Yet, receiving a wide circulation Europe, a libel of this character is apt to deter emigration to the Dominion The wonder is ihat a corporation like the Northern Pacific Railway Company should lend its sanction to the publication of these atrocious falsehoods respecting the climate of the Canadian Northwest, espe cially as the country traversed by the American road is in such close proximity to that so unstintingly condemned The writer of the pamphlet has not, however performed his task very cleverly He has gone so far in his detractions that a European emigrant contemplating settlement settlement in the Northwest of Canada or the United States, will be disposed to extend his enquiries beyond the information contained in so manifestly partisan a work For that purpose he may take up a newspaper of August 3rd, 1882, and discover a telegram from Winnipeg, whose climate, it is said, consists of seven months of Arctic win-'' win-'' ter and five months of cold weather," to the effect that " the heat has been in-" in-" tense here during the past two days " The thermometer registered 101 0 in the shade at noon to-day " And learning that 104 in the shade is regarded in the country traversed by the Northern racific Railway as " cold " weather," he will ask himself whether the climate of Dakota, Montana and Idaho does not approach that of the region region to which we are told writers of such pamphlets, as that from which we quote, are consigned, and whether he had not better postpone the possibility of an acquaintance with so uncomfortable an atmosphere until a later stage of his existence Startled by the dangers dangers of a place in which " the " water sets back and covers all the surrounding country, drowning " stock, floating away dwellings, buildings " and fences, and driving the farmers oft " to the tops of hills to save their lives," he may take up a text-book of the sreo graphy of the country and learn that ; about Winnipeg, or for the matter of that throughout the greater portion of the Canadian Northwest, there are no hill tops to which the farmer could flee to escape such a flood as is here pictured, But if he is it diligent seeker after the truth he will turn to the record of the climatic character of the American North , west, and taking up a newspaper of Apri " 8th, 1881, he will read the following despatch from Yankton, Dakota i , "The Ice gorge here broke last night Two hundred buildings bad been partially submerged and much damage was done A steamer was carried awsy with the gorge for a mile and stranded on the railway track (the Northern Pacific) Two hundred persons here were rescued from the submerged farming districts The fuel supply has been reduced to a minimum Many kinds of provisions are running short The freihet swept away thou tunds of cords of wocd," Ills interest being thus excited and his curiosity whetted he will endeavour to learn further particulars of a country in which such disasters arise, and con tinuing ilia researches to the newspaper fyles of April 14th, he will find the follow ing graphic description of the condition , x i JVakota in the spnngol 1881 : "The Missouri Is gradually subsiding Ice Is piled to a height of ten to thirty feet along the bank and on the bars and at the bottoms, Yankton Is Ailing with refugee from th low lamw uuisiae neip is needwl, as the ro, sources of Hie cltlicens are not

submerged or floating about la ti jo water At Grwu Inland of twenty hoii but one remains, and the Ice Is from ten to twent feet deep, The bottom from here to llii J-,, g Klotix, sixty miles in length and from lire to twenty miles In width, Is Mil under water, Yankton parties arc still OJt In yawls bringing In the people The QB is almost (pwtJtuUof AlPlMd short Of provisions Winter still holds on, Increasing the suffering of the homeless families Ya nk-ton nk-ton can furnish shelter for about one thousand, thousand, and Is making great efforts to supply clothing, fuel and provisions from a limited st ere As soon as the gorge breaks biats can be sent below for supplies All railways north and west are snowed In Eight steamers are lylnghigh up on the Ice and far Inland Losses to property In general are very great The season of floods has only begun The entire Missouri slope is burled in snow " This will probably satisfy the or dinary intending emigrant that the region traversed by the Northern racific Railway is not the Eden which the Company in its latest pamphlet paints it It will convince him that the statements relative to the climatic character of the Canadian Northwest are not to be ac cepted as accurate without iurther enquiry into their foundation, and that extended and impartial enquiry will convey convey the intelligence that the Canadian Northwest enjoys a climate as healthy as any in the world, that its soil produces the finest wheat crops on this continent, that its plains are, free from blizzards and cyclones, that cattle graze on the open plains all the year round without shelter, and that floods are unknown except at long intervals in a small tract of country on the line of the Rod River And as for the Northern racific Railway Company it will come to discover when the in tending emigrant ascertains these facts that " honesty is the best policy " even m in the preparation of a land guide-book, EGYPT AND PEEU, Egyptologists have been felicitating themselves on the preservation from in jury of the Boulak Museum during the recent disturbances in the land of the Pharaohs, and it should certainly be matter for rejoicing to all students of ancient history that such a noble colloc tion of the vestiges of ancient Egyptian civilization has escaped destruction by barbarous hands Wo have not heard of any expression of anxiety lest the fate thus deprecated should befal whatever remains of ancient American civilization the labour and care of archmolo- gists have , succeeded in saving from the ravages of time, ignorance and prejudice in the land of the Incas, It is true that there is some difference between between the value of the Peruvian reli cs and that of those which have been arranged arranged so skilfully in the institution over which M Maspero presides In the South American Republic there is no museum which civilization at large is interested in protecting from damage, There is also some distinction between untaught and grasping Arabs, by whom the most cher ished object illustrative of ancient life, is valued simply as a medium for exchange, and South Americans, not quite devoid of sentiments of patriotic pride The risk, therefore, of plunder in Teru may be less than it is in Egypt Nevertheless, even our own experience affords evidence of the recklessness of an excited populace, howevor civilized, and of its small regard, in the hour of fanati cal fury, for the rarest or costliest memorials memorials of the past The safety of what is worth preserving in Peru, during the present reigti of disorder, disorder, can hardly, therefore, be considered considered quite assured and that there is much in the country the loss of which would be thought disastrous by students of Ameri can antiquity and of comparative ethnology ethnology can scarcely be doubted From some1 points of view,indeed, such a loss would be even more grievous than that of any old-world monumonts The latter have been so profoundly studied and their significance sot forth by so many men of learning that, though there may be still much to do, a good deal has been already done towards the solution of the problems which they suggest It is otherwise with the relics of American antiquity, It is only in comparatively recent years thai they have begun to receive that attention which they merit, and the interesting questions which they call up are by no means settled If we take the entire range of American antiquities, northern, central and southern, we shall find it to be a field of vast extent, a great part of which is still but sparely, if at all, occupied occupied And certainly there is no division of it which can be said to possess greater interest or to oiler larger scope for enlightened study than the civilization of the Incas Their pottery, stone-ware and wood and metal work of all kinds, indicate no contemptible progress in some branches of art In architecture they had reached a dogroe of excellence which in some respects was wonderful -Humboldt could hardly sufliciently admire the great road of the Incas, '' that stupendous work by "means of which communication was " maintained among the provinces of the " empire along an extent of upwards of " J,000 geographical miles " At equal distances apart, along its course, were inns, baths, &c, intended for the accommodation, accommodation, some of the family of the sovereign, others of : the travelling travelling public Some of these were, not very long since, in good preservation, preservation, The great philosopher just mentioned sayg that none of the Roman roads in Italy, France or Spain, appeared to him more imposing than that great highway through the lofty Peruvian uplands uplands No, less surprising were their aqueduoU which the Spanish conquerors ruthlessly and stupidly " destroyed, Though they had not learned the use of the arch, tho Peruvians ingeniously contrived contrived to bridge tho torreiits which ipter-geoted ipter-geoted their roads, Tlieirf temples and houses were also constructed with an eye to bounty as well its to oli liity, In (heir religion and social customs there was much to provoke comparison with those of nations in the old world, and some have even found a resemblance between them and the Egyptians It is evident, therefore, that Teru, as well as Egypt, has some claims on the sympathy of the learned It would not only be a loss to the civilized world but a disgrace to all Americans if the precious relics of its past were allowed to be de stroyed What may be tho extent of its collections we cannot n,y, but, as already several cabinets of value have been sold out of the country, it may be taken for granted that the successive Governments Governments and learned Peruvians have not been so indifferent to their own antiquarian antiquarian resourceslis to make no effort at the preservation of illustrative specimens Tho subject is one of interest to antiqua rians on both continents and, though there may be no ground for fear that the museums of Peru will run any risk in the present unsettled state of the country, it would bo more satisfactory if provision were made which would, as far as possi ble, secure them trom angry invaders or rough-handed mobs AN UNLUCKY MINISTER, Mr Crooks is likely to prove the "Jonah "of the Ontario, as Sir Richard Cartwright did

It means INCREASED TRADE FOR MONTREAL, Toronto and other cities it means increased demand for our manufactures and increased work for our people, and better business for our tradesmen It means increased trade for our shipping, outward and inwards, increased activity for our seaports Put the question to our shipowners and see what thoy will say Our Canadian stoamship-ownors will tell you that to them the greater the population population of Canada tho bettor will be their prospects now and hereafter Thoy can well afford to open every avenue for Canadian immigration immigration Being asked what certainty there was of our securing our immigrants passing through New York, even with the low rates, Mr Begg replied, EVERY SECURITY ' 1 ' Simply because these rates are only available via Port Arthur us an objective point where the United States huve no power to divert the emigrants When speaking of tho difficulties in the way of promoting emigration to Canada, Mr Begg said they were much more numerous than people imagined American agents are very active, and not slow to take advantage of evei y weapon they can find But he said THE WORST ENEMIES TO CANADA are Canadians, and the worst difficulties we have to face emanate from Canadian sources We have to contend against Canadians, and others, who write or speuk against the Northwest simply because they are INTERESTED PERSONALLY OR POLITICALLY in another part of Canada We find Canadian papers to gain some political end decrying the climate or the resources of the country There seems to be a morbid desire on the part of some Canadian papers to herald forth in the loudest notes anything desparaging to tho country to which they owe allegiance It a blizzard occurs it is depicted with great head lines, and described with all imaginary horror horror When it is 40 below zero all the world is made acquainted with the fact, but the SUCCESSIVE WEEKS OF BEAUTIFUL WEATHER are unnoticed by them as if they had never been heard of When on early frost takes place everybody knows it Of course the Canadian public can understand that this is done not from any real intention to injure Canada, but to gain a point against the Government, and if it could be confined to the circle it intended to influence, it would not do much harm But unfortunately unfortunately there is a portion of the British press actuated by motives inimical to Canada and Canadian enterprises, who gladly avail themselves of quoting these disparaging statements and sending them broadcast throughout Great Britain How can we, agents, resent such statements when we are confronted with the fact tliat they are the utterances of our own Canadian papers ? If these same Canadian papers could understand the damage they are doing to their own patrons they would per haps moderate their views, for every blow struck at Canada means a loss, more or less, to every merchant, manufacturer, tradesman and mechanic in th : country " Pretty strong language ?" said our representative "I mean it, " said Mr Uegg, "lam a Canadian and speak as a Canadian, and my words in this respect will be borne out by every man working in the interest of Canada abroad THE GREATEST BUG-BEAR flaunted in the faces of Canadian agents is the severity of the climate of Canada, whereas the Canadian climate is one of the healthiest in the world We are indebted to Mr Geo

We say : No; you give us your citizenship for three years, and we will give you the land; the American term of residence residence is live years They enact continuous residence, with us only six months in each year of the three is required And with re ference to pre-emptions, no settler in Dakota can get a pre-emption until he gets a certifi cate of his homestead The result is, that he is often obliged to locate his pre-emption 30 or 40 miles away from his homestead (Cheers ) In our Northwest, the momenta man makes his homestead entry, he can make his pre-emption entry, and he gets the two side by side ; and he receives all the advau tages that can accrue to him from his entering for that pre-emption, by the fact ot his occu pation of his homestead It is just as sure to him as his homestead, provided he fulfils the necessary requirements of his homestead So that there is no comparison between Dakota and our Northwest in that respect And yet hon gentlemen get up in this House und state that one of the causes of the exodus, which I could not discover, is the inferiori'y of our laud regulations to those of the I nited States Now, WITH IIKOAIID TO THE E0!HS, I found a great number of men in Manitoba from Dakota, from Minnesota, and especially from Montana I met one very intelligent man at Medicine Hat who had been a mixed grazer and farmer in Montana, and he said to me, "As compared with Montana this is God's country " (Cheers ) That was his expression Now, I have heard it said tliat there are large settlements of Canadians in the United States, and hon gentlemen opposite opposite attribute those settlements, to the difference difference in the land laws of the two countries sav that is absurd and unfair I know that there are largo settlements of Canadians in the western states whole districts tor miles around; Iain speaking more particularly of Michigan and Illinois, in which there are large numbers of people from my own neighbourhood neighbourhood Men whom I have lived with for fifteen years have gone out there And why did they go? For this simple reason: they were led away by the profuse and attractive advertising not only of the American govern ment, but principally of American railways that hail lands for oJtle I remember twenty years ago seeing something that I thought should not be tolerated by the Canadian (icople the immense placards which were hung up at every prominent point in the country I remember seeing in the Union station at Toronto, and also at Montreal, immense gluss cases, about six feet long, containing specimens of all sorts of grain from Illinois, Minnesota and other western States I remember one in particular particular In front there was a prairie scene, with long waving grass, and on one side a herd of buffalo ; immediately in the rear were a number of engineers with their instruments set up, and behind them were men laying a railway track ; behind that again were three or four ploughs, a reaping machine, a threshing machine, and other instruments at work, and behind that again were a lot of carts ihawing wheat to the railway Now, what immigrant could resist an advertisement like that? (Hear, hear ) Why, it was a w hole lecture in itself We had no prairie lands to offer at that time, and a iy young man, or old man tuber, who was intelligent and vigorous, and was de irons of making a home fur himself and his sons at the least expenditure expenditure ot labour, was not going into the back woods of Ontario, where he would hare to cut down maple trees, and ash trees, and elm trees, to make place for his borne Here was a c wintry completely devoid of all these obstructions and it attracted a lot of people ; hence the settlement of Canadian in j the northwestern Mate I know many of these old men are strong in their allegiance to British institutions, but they went there for the sake of pecuniarily benefiting themselves themselves and families, and they lived and died British subject I know some UwLy who never went to poll a vote ; though their sons voted, they did not (Ilr, hear ) What I want to point out is this, that the young people people of to-day are ju-4 as strong in their attachment to Canada as those old meo to whom I r f-r ; and when we have a country as extensive and as accessible to off -r to these people, we will not have many more of these American SPttb-ments, proviinl hoc geoilemeo opposite do not deter people f l-m going in there by their cries about cold, wan: of f'teJ, bad walrr, blizzards and tod huid regulations (Cheers ) is sriAirvs or trs tut, the boo gentleman says the thermometer went down to 40 - I BKftKed that tD day in my own verandah at Kumptville, it went down to 35, mid the strnne wind and the damp atmosphere ut the time, I am satisfied, registered more on my feelings and those of any man in the conntry than 4ft of tlio clear atmosphere of the Northwest 1 know the fro it may huvo a deterring effect on tlioso who will not thoroughly nn-d nn-d 'rs a id the conditions and tho effect it has on that country in an agricultural agricultural sense ; but it should be remembered that tho cold period in the far Northwest is much shorter than it is either in Manitoba or Ontario Winter conies on in the extreme Northwest ubnut perhaps the middle of November, November, and men who have lived there ten years say that timing all that time there was no season in which they could not sow their grain on the first of March, and the winter is practically gone on the first of February As to the ell'ects of frost, naturally it may be difficult difficult to get through tho winter until those people have built for themselves comfortable houses and got cheap fuel Hut it has this effect upon the country, that every inch of frost that penetrates into tho soil during the winter and thaws out in the spring, disintegrates the foisl elements of the plants which are growing upon it, and oilds to tho store value of that country us an agricultural region Wo know that as you approach the Mississippi from the north, even as far south as southern Dakota, where the frost docs not penetrate in such a great depth, from six to eight years is about as long as the average surface of that country would pie-serve pie-serve its maximum virgin production, for the simple reason that the frost docs not pene Irate any further, and as no sub-soiling has been attempted, the roots of (lie plants do not penetrate into the soil that has not been loosened loosened by the frost In the lands in that section, section, which have for years been under cultivation, cultivation, the falling olf, from this cause, is not compensated by the increase through new territory; but our Northwest will preserve her maximum production of that linilen tilti-vation tilti-vation four or five years longer, so that even at a much less rapid pace of settlement than our neighbours, her maximum will be continued continued lor a much longer period (' 'hern ) ciiahactku or tub (main There is another feature to which 1 draw attention attention Kvery hon gentleman who has paid attention to the zone belts of the earth in which food cereals are produced, knows that it is in the north temperate zones tliat nearly all the grains are grnwn, and the nearer the northern limit, of that boll in which grain Is matured perfectly, the better is the quality of the grain What I illustrate by that is this, that we, having to-day in that Northwest country, a larger area of land fit for agrietiltii nil purposes, when we get a fair proportion under under cultivation, we will produce a larger quantity continuously of a better qiiality'than tlie American States can ever hope to do, and I stale what 1 know is a matter of fact, when 1 say that w heat near our ow n boundary in northern Dakota is mure valuable than that grown further south Why is that ? Simply because the grain is of a Is-tter quality it is what is technically called of a flinty character, and, when grown, will produce more flour, and is used to mix with the softer grains grown in the southern wheat belt (H -ar, hear ) In the southern belt, the same w heat canimt be grown more than three years successively, because it so softens that the germinating properties are lost and half the seeds wiil not sprout A large quantity of our w heat, even as early as three years ago, was sent down to that region for seed wheat, as the hon member for Mar quette well knows The ultimate result of this will be that wlun that country is fairly under cultivation, when it has a population of live, six or eight millions, its production will be so great that when exported either by the Hudson's Hay route, by the Canadian 1'a-cilic 1'a-cilic Hallway or 1'ort Arthur, I care not -how, a d latin bed on the Liverp ol markets, those who schedule the brcad-ttufls and make up I heir prices for the season will not only ask how much is the production in Knglund, in Hussia, or in India or the United States, but the great question wiil be what will be tho export from Canada? (Cheers ) The production production of Canada will regulate the prices of the world This question bd brn dnlt with no long ana so variedly and iy so many hon gentlemen in the house, w ho have many years ago mode their maiden speech, that there is verly little left for me to say, ami I feel that my remarks will have perhaps less iniei -,t than they might have had at an earlier date (Cries of go on, go on ) Hut there is one thing, in speaking of the country west i n settlement, which I think is very important, ami the reason 1 mention it is tliat in loading, as I ulway do, carefully the reports of the geological surveys I find no mention is ma le of it, nor is it mentioned by any surveyor or others who have travelled through the country country I think, therefore, tiiat I am perfectly justified in drawing attention to the fact that in the extreme Northwest fuel will he so cheap that the difficulty mentioned by the member for Marquette with reference to bui d-ing bui d-ing timber will bo easily remedied Now, I quite disagree with him I am satisfied I know it that TUB CHKAPKST BL'ILMNG MATERIAL, of the most durable and beautiful quality that exists on this continent, exists in that Northwest Northwest Territory I referred a few minutes ago to the large deposists of almost pure clay Those lieds are the deposits of the disintegration disintegration of the hill rocks, long before the country was settled, anyway (laughter), and the lime which the rocks contained has been carried off while held in solution The clay, almost pure, is deposited and I refer especially to the coal regions in immense lieds over the coal The only substance that these clay beds contain, aside from the clay, is a silicate sand which is insoluble in water What drew my attention to this was, tliat I saw at various places on the river banks, natural brick kilns, burnt and almost ready for the carter, of acres and a-res in extent It came in this way The dejiosits were made over the coal bcd-i by the action of water In the course of time, ravines have been fornml and cut through the coal beds Eventually the grass grew over the ravines, and, by some accidents in prairie fires, the coal caught fire, and continued back ior acres under the surface, converting the whole super-incumlientmass, super-incumlientmass, from 150 to 200 feet, intoone mans of beautiful brick Heor, hear ) It is the CHARACTER OF TINS BRICK I wish to draw the attention of the hsue to It is a brick formed from the clay, entirely devoid of lime, containing a silicate sand In burning, after mixture, there is no expansion of the particles of lime The brick is alm-wt perfectly compact It is asiik iou brick It is a crude glass, impervious to water, and almost indestructible by atmospheric influence influence I found blocks in the Saskatchewan and in the Bow Kiver, and north ot the Kid Deer River, which must have bun there, per haps for a thousand rears, where they had fallen fallen off, by the action of water and weather, into the water Taking them np ami breaking them with my hatchet, I found they were perfectly dry Taking up ordinary limeste and smashing it, 1 con id see ender ee of the poro-ity and moisture there, convincing me that tliat brick was more impervious to water than oar blue limestone 1 found, wbrrethy hail drifted down the river fur many miles, tbrr were as smooth as any state I ever saw polished So much with reference to the building material There is a scarcity of wood, it is true, and transport will cost something, something, but in that country yoi find the rlay always overlying the material for converting it into brick the coal b i yow find it over the whole country ; and brx k may be Braided Braided into any form pillars, enm-rs, mouldings mouldings into any shane possible fur the rotHtrartioa of bcsiiifa!

settlement as to have ' i20 acres cropped with no livii stack To invest in stock means to abridge the ability of the average farmer for extended cultivation, so that the present CP It contract with

to the company I find they are not favourable to it A more liberal policy would certainly be in the interest of permanent settlement settlement THE INDIAN QUESTION is a difficult and troublesome one, and oft-times oft-times comes up there His well known revengeful revengeful spirit and predatory habits are a source of constant uneasiness to settlers The opinion is gaining ground, that unless the police force is very much increased wherever there is a reserve, ai-tual hostilities arc-sure arc-sure to break out on some of tho occasions when an ill-equipped and inadequate force is sent to take Indian prisoners The real spirit of the Indian may be Correctly gathered from what took place last winter at the Qu'Appelle Valley I received the facts from an eye-witness, one ot the settlers, who drove the police force from Broadview, a distance distance of sixteen miles, to the shanty down iu the valley, where the stolen flour and bacon were stored and guarded by an armed body of determined Indians I drove to the place, and from a projecting eminence was regaled with a grand ptno-raniic ptno-raniic view of the valley and deep gully through which alone vehicles can gain access to the plain beneath At that place the valley valley is some miles in width and in the long ago hod been the bed of a majestic river, which now is dwindled to a mere creek meandering iu serpentine course among reeds and brush through the middle of the plain The banks are high, rocky and steep, bare and bleak in the north side, but thick-wooded thick-wooded on the southern slopes They afford almost complete protection from the blizzard that may be devastating everything in the pinirie overhead The jju Hey is about a half mile in length, tortuous, densely wooded on both sides, and the narrow pass along which the police had to enter or cucapc has deep ruts, huge stones and stumps of trees, render ing it all but irora-isable for horse or vehicle Two miles along the valley is the shanty in which was stored the stolen booty, consisting of flour and bacon, and within were a number of warrior aimed with leaded rifle, and without an interpreter The chief dis-mouut'xl dis-mouut'xl and approached the door, making bis mission known through the interpreter to an Indian dtcked in feathers and red paint and armed with club and rifle who guarded the doorway The chief and the handful of men with him had only revolvers, but he was brave and demanded the restoration of the stolen l -operty and the surrender of t he tliieves The warrior, bent on resistance, peremptorily refused, well knowing that the pulice were entirely at his mercy Becoming audacious he approached the chief of police and struck Ins hatchet into the ground across the approach to the door, and challenged him to cross on pain of instant death The chief hesitated for a time, tried negotiation, which only increased the Indian' contempt, fr he took the hatchet and stuck it within a foot of the chief repeating hi challenge Construing Construing it into mere bravado the chief advanced, advanced, and in an instant door and window bristled with the muzzle of rifles aimed at him In another moment he would bare been a dead man but fur the brave and timely timely intervention of a squaw, Mrs Pappanoa She yelled as only a squaw can, and rnahed on the rifle, throwing them upward and preventing preventing any firing Had one

realize tli it the line north ol Lake Superior will, in tlie i onise of two or three inonilis, be open fur traffic, For many years past the wisdom nf the construction construction of this portion of the great transcontinental transcontinental lino has been debated The country to be traversed has been depicted as of the rough est and most uninviting character, and the expense placed ut such an excessive figure that more than once It has been stated that the Syndicate were not likely ever to proceed with the work Meantime, lor much ol Ihe year, the freight and passenger business of the' Canadian Northwest has pussed over American American roads by a rather circumlocutory route, and over four or more different railroad systems systems Every resident of, and visitor to, the Northwest, has become accustomed to the inevitable, and, on the whole, pleasant detail-lions detail-lions in St Paul and Chicago, and many con nections nf a business and sis nil nharactor have thereby been formed An acquaintance bos also been scraped with customs officers which otherwise would not have been of so intimate a character The first break iu this chain of association occurred when the luke route was opened out, and Jnow almost a revolution revolution is threatened by Ihe opening of the all-Canadian rail route No doubt the Ameri-rican Ameri-rican system will still secure a portion of the business probably a large share until the Ontario Ontario system of railruods has been connected with the Canadian Pacific, but the time is nevertheless dose at hand when Hat Fortage, Port Arthur, Callendar, Pembroke, Ottawa, etc , will be more familiar names to the tra veller between Eastern Canadu and Manitoba than are St Paul, Chicago Port Huron or St Thomas The trip from Winnipeg to Montreal will soon bo made without change of curs, and the time now occupied in both passenger and height transportation will be reduced nearly, if not quits!, one-half With reduced time should corae a reduction in nassenger tariffs and freight rates The cost of liviHg in this country should be "considerably "considerably reduced, and the farmer should in an other year get relatively belter prices lor his grain than at present Canadian travellers will no longer blush for their country when told that their money is at a discount of from two to eight per cunt, and burly Manitobans will not receive the imprecations of theirfellow-passengers if they ask to have the car windows opened when the mercury is hovering hovering about the vicinity of zero The Toronto and Montreal papers, and all Eastern Canada correspondence, will be at least a day " fresher" fresher" than thoy are at the present time, and in very many ways the long distance from old anrfociations which many now feel will be perceptibly perceptibly lessened In summer the route is pretty sure to be a popular one, partly because of the water stretcli which it offers to travellers, travellers, but in the winter it will be of rather a monotonous character, and it will require all the inducements of quick time and low lares which the Canadian Pacific people can oiler to secure the passenger trallic With most people, however, time and money are powerful powerful persuaders, and when placed iu the scale against slghUseeing are almost certain to tip the beam It will bean immense satisfaction, iu any event, to get two-thirds of the way to Montreal in the time which is now consumed in accomplishing the equally dreary journey between this city and Bt Paul Winnipeg Timet - E very Woman in the Laud owes it to

week First it must be remembered that it was widely asserted and assented to by the majority of those supposed to be well informed informed on the subject in Winnipeg, that from Q'f-Appellu troops could not possibly reach Clarke's Crossing on the South Saskatchewan ia less than six week On Mouclay last, the Cth instant, the General commanding ordered the advance from Fort Qu' Appelle The force then consisted of the froth battalion, Winni-jtcj: Winni-jtcj: Kifliv , 300 stronp, the Winnipeg Field Battery, two guns and tiO men, so scouts aud about 20 Winnipeg sharpshooters Along with this force were taken ammunition and supplies supplies for thirty days in wagons Tlic line of march, along thu prairie trail, of this comparatively comparatively small force extended nearly three miles in length The troops were all required required to march on foot and they have, every day fur a week now, been on the march The roads for heavy marching have been something terrible, and the Bufferings of the volunteers have beeu men as cannot be readily conceived The first day's nnrch, on Monday, 6th inst , was short, being only nine miles The start, however, was made late in the day Camp was pitched that night on a wild, bleak country, low and wet as a sponge An hour after aids a severe wind storm and a heavy sno v blizzard from the north set in and continued all night The c jld was so intunse that ft x of the men SEITRKI) anv su:ti The next day's march was a surprise to the pJdal extremities of the corps, being nineteen miles, through frozen water eighteen inches deep and over a frozen road, which for waggon ruts would put to shame nuny of the roughest roughest of corduroy roads to he met with in the hick townships of an Ontario constituency Although personally, as a correspondent, i enjoyed whatever comforts and privileges the expedition afforded, yet I could sympathize with the bufferings of the men of the 90th battalion, many of whom are personal acquaintances of mine' in Winnipeg The 90th, to a great extent, is composed composed of young business men, either in commercial or financial pursuits of their own, or employed in banks, law orliees, railway and government offices, besides a great miny of the respectable tradesmen and Jiuechauics of the city They have been accustomed to no such work in ther lives as that wbich they have lately performed, and even those who have seen their hardest days either home-steading home-steading or surveying for the Dominion, have never done so much hard work in their career on such miserable and inadequate food Of the fare, I shall say something later on in this letter The boys of this corps, however, set out with a determination to go through everything everything and show the people what they can do This is partly prompted oh account of the " COLD SEND OFF" they received from the citizens of Winnipeg when marching from their headquarters to the station for embarkation This send off might be accounted for from the fact that there was at that time very little excitement over and very little importance importance attached to the rebellion in the west, and when the troops marched out of Winnipeg Winnipeg the people fully expected to see them march back again in a few hours Nevertheless Nevertheless the boys feel aggrieved all the same, and Lope to make as good a name for themselves as possible as a sort of letaliation After the second day's march the blisters on the feet were so numerous and the stillness of the liniDs so great that they began to feel that a halt would be appreciated " A " battery from Quebec being a day's march behina the geueral ordered a halt on Wednesday in order to rest the force and allow the battery to catch up Daring the previous week's delay for supplies at Troy and Fort Qu' Appelle the troops had BUSS CONSTANTLY UBIU CD, and ha i improved so much in their steadiness steadiness and drill that on the inspection by Gen Middleton on the day of the halt he was so pleased that he caused the followiug brigade order to be published to the troops : "The major-general commanding has been pleased to express bis ifritat satisfaction witli Liea' :'illerJ'ke

it is generally thought throughout the camp, that the enemy will bo scattered individually in the bush all over the country To light a body of men so scattered means A I'HKTTY SKHIOUS ISUSINKHS If our force charges in any one particular place, the benelit derived would be the possible possible killing of one or two of thu enemy while the bullets, no doubt, would be pouring pouring in from many hundred different directions The troops here do not expect to handle thu enemy in a hand to baud conllict Thu tactics pursued by the general will bo to keep in the clear country as much as possiblu and advance all the time, and thus to draw out the enemy from tho bush The presence of "A" Battery lends a great amount of confidence confidence and the force hopes that the engage, merit will be such as to enable the artillery to work to advantage Although there is every chance of an early engagement, there" is nothing which the soldiers in this camp thinks less about than the coming fight The heavy marches, their hunger and the poor food supplied them occupies their attention to such an extent (hat they neither find the time nor the inclination inclination now to think about any engagement which might soon arise I remember well Colonel liurnahy's description of his cold drive across the snows of Itussia on his way to Khiva, wbure he describes that all he and his followers could possibly think of was what they could get to eat at the different posts Here there has been some great mistake mistake made in the matter of the men's food The food issued is simply tea and haul tack and canned beef So far, on two occasions, I believe there was a slight change, when some fresh beef and a little pork were issued But in the main canned beef, bard biscuit aud tea has been the sole fare The men, unused as they are to the fare, would not perhaps perhaps grumble so much if a sufficient sufficient ration or allowance was issued them For instance, during the first threa days' heavy marching when the men mi T THE NECESSITY for good nourishing food All that was issued them was three "hard tack" biscuits each n day, which had to do three meals or one biscuit a meal The government ration is a pound and a half or ten biscuits a day The inun also complained at so much canned beef being given to them instead of pork The canned beef, tho manufacture of a Chicago firm, has a

a man grows accustomed to take a daily ration of half a gill of liquor each day, he would, after the campaign, become or likely to become a confirmed " ration drinker " But while a daily ration would

would luel on the matter One thing is curtain aud that is a daily ration of grog is not at all necessary, necessary, although it stands open how much life and spirit an occasional "horn" would throw

18851015: I HIE GAZETTE MONTlMiAl TlIUltSDAY OCTOBER 15," 1888 MOSTRSAl, TUURSVAY VCTOUXIl 15 THE BIALTH QUESTION BErORE THE COURTS An important victory wiw gainotl yesterday, yesterday, when tho egnilj of tho notion Uken by the Provincial ftw Heitlih was sustained by Mr Juxticn TaHchorau A writ of Injunction was jirnyod for gainst tho city by the iiiiinini lity of Mile Kml, in order to jiruvent tho uho of the Kxhihition building for licmiiitul I'uriiOH' Hi Honor lmd no hcititiitinn in deciding, in tho first jiliicr", that the municipality of Miln End hud shown no nUrost entitling them to como into oourt And liu wont further, and disposed disposed of tho main question ; that in to nay, whether tho Federal or tho local Legislature has jurisdiction over nutter of public health and tho enactment of regulations rendered necessary by tho presence of disease of a contagious nature 'n this point His Honor set at rest, as far as the decision of a court can settle any question, all doubts which have been entertained as to tho legality of the measures taken under the provincial authority The learned judge holds that the Federal jnrisdiction extends merely to quarantine and the establishment and maintenance ol marine hospitals, and that tho Provincial Legislature has control generally over all matters of public health Tho Federal act of I SON is therefore therefore constitutional only so far as relates to quarantine, and is without effect in so far as it assumes to legislate on health regulations In a word, therefore, the authority of the Provincial Board of Health has been sustained, and tho uncertainty uncertainty which existed as to tho legality of their action has been happily removed It may be added that tho promptness with which the learned judge has disposed of the question submitted to him, is a cause for congratulation in the present emergency The case involved tho ex amination of several statutes, and was not free from dilliculty, yet the decision was given within a few hour after the argument argument IIGHTING THE DISEAS" The civic authorities are now confirmed confirmed in possession of the Mount Royal hospitals, and can proceed unhesitatingly in the work of occupation The number of inmates is increasing with rapidity, and it is satisfactory to learn that the Board of Health has determined upon pursuing strictly the policy of isolation By no other means can the spread of the disease be so surely checked, and when the board determines to practically quarantine every infected house in which the patient declines removal to the hos pital, it will have the support of public opinion It is gratifying, too, to know that a committee of medi cal men of hi"h standing has been named to supervise the management management of the hospitals, and report upon the same from time to time, it beinf of great consequence that confidence in the administration of the hospital should exist Dr Gardner, formerly house surgeon ot tne tienerai hospital, a physician of large experience and excel lent reputation, has accepted the position of superintending medical officer of the Protestant wards, a fact calculated to promote confidence in the efficiency of the hospital management 1 Altogether the work goes bravely bn, and promises from this time forward to earn a reward in the gradual disappearance of the epidemic JTEWrOONPLAHD POLITICS Our Newfoundland correspondent sends a most interesting account of the state of political parties in that island The split m the Protestant party, and threatening of Catholic supremacy, have caused the retirement of Sir William Whiteway, the premier, and the selection of Hon Robert Thorburn, a prominent merchant of St Johns, as his successor By this move the Protestant majority is harmonized, but the people at large lose the services at the head of the Government Government of one of the ablest and most competent competent statesmen the country has known The religious quarrel in Newfoundland is evidently deep-rooted and bitter, and in their blind and stupid fanaticism, in their crass intolerance, men fling away opportunities big with benefits for them, selves and their country The experience in the case of the island is by no means singular; even in Canada, indeed in this very city of Montreal, we have learned how intensely men can hate one another for the love of God, but it is a sad com mentary on our boasted progress umler free institutions and popular government that in a general election the sole consideration consideration of the electors should be the sectarianism of the candidate Our correspondent pays a high and well-deserved tribute to the late Premier, Sir William Whiteway, and suggests that his appointment to the governorship of the island, rendered vacant vacant by the death of Sir John Glover, would be a fitting recognition of his services services to the colony The appointment would assuredly be an excellent and deserved one, but we must dissent from some of the reasons for which it is urged, as for instance, Sir William's intimate acquaintance with the politics, the wants, the aspirations of the people A governor requires no qualifications of this kind for the successful discharge of his duties ; it is enough that he is intelligent,well-disposed, willing to learn and anxious to plea!1 Ilm Miliary will look niter tho upiterhjl- vndl-belnn of the eoplo Then it is by no means certain' that Sir William Whit-way's Whit-way's long participation in party struggle doi'n not rather unlit him for tho ollleu of governor, or more properly upenklng, make tho acceptability of his appointment appointment somewhat doubtful Thesn objec-linns, objec-linns, If they may bo so called, are made to show that our correnpnndent is not occupying linn ground In his criticism of the present method of appointing col onial governors, but with him wo recognize recognize fitness lor tho olllutt in tho late Premier of tho island AN ArRIOAN NEGRO REPUBLIC The republic of Uberin, to which the l!ev Moses Aaron Hopkins, of whoso rn- mat kable career we recently gave a sketch, has just been Appointed United States minister, is nno of tho most extraordinary extraordinary (philanthropic experiments of J the present age Its name implies tho object for which it wits established The idea of testing tho capacity ol tho negro race for self government had been broached early in the present century by some of the more sanguine of tho abolitionists of the lime It was not, however, until after the accession of lames Monroe to tho presidency that a method was proposed proposed for giving it practical form In IM7 a body known as the American Colonization society undertook to pro-euro pro-euro on tho west coast of A fnca a piece of territory suHioient for tlm settlement of, at least, as many frecdmen as there woro then, or wero likely to bo for several years in tho United States They succeeded in securing, by arrangement with tho native chiefs, about 10,M)I square miles in tho vicinity of Cape Pahuas, between Sierro Ieone and the Ivory coast Tho cll'orts of Zachary Macaulay in that part of the continent to provide for the moral and material welfare of the blacks may probably have led to its adoption for the purpose of tho larger enterprise It was not until 1H2 1, after President Monroe had entered upon upon his second term of of lice, that the colony was formally established It was only in 1S47, during tho presidency of Polk, that the settlement was declared an independent republic Its existence existence as such was first acknowledged by England and afterwards in succession by tho various European powers, but the United States did not follow the example till 1SC1 In 1873 the population numbered about 7:20,000, of whom only 1 9,000 were colored people from America, the remainder consisting of native Africans The capital, Monrovia, so called after President Monroe, has a population of about 13,000 The Liberians have churches, schools, missions, and all the ordinary machinery of civilization The constitution is modelled on that of the United States There is no restriction as to the number of terms (of two years each) for which one person may be elected president There are four ministers in tho Cabinet Secretary of State, Secretary of tho Treasury, Attornev-General and Postmaster- General According to some authori ties, the commerce of tho country is nourishing and agriculture is success fully practised Sugar, coffee, cotton, maize, wheat, barley, oats, tomatoes, cucumbers, tamarinds, lemons, oranges, guavas, pineapples and African peaches are among the products, besides many of which, they export palm-oil, gold dust, ivory and hides The revenue is derived chiefly from customs duties In 1871 ijie Government contractel a loan of half a million dollars, which was issued in Eng land, but no interest has been paid on it, the republic being actually bankrupt bankrupt Accounts differ as to how far Liberia has proved a successful test of the capability of the negro to advance in the path of civilization, unaided by the white man Some writers maintain that it has disappointed all the hopes of the founders; others, without being enthusiastic over the result, consider it, on the whole, satisfactory One strange reproach against the community is its permission, permission, or connivance at, slavery so largely prevalent among tho aborigines of Africa It is generally conceded that the insertion in the constitution of a clause refusing citizenskip to any white person has been a fatal mistake Those who are most intimately acquainted with the Southern negro are convinced that, deprived of white guidance and example, he is sure to sink in the scale of civilization civilization In Hayti vast , numbers of the natives have relapsed into barbarism and paganism In an article in the June Century, from which we have already quoted, Bishop Dudley, of Kentucky, says that " the separation of the negro race from the white means for the negro continued continued and increasing degradation and decay " The experiment of Liberia, therefore, can hardly bo regarded as offering any solution of the negro question question in the South Nevertheless, the fact that a Christian and, at least, as to institutions and habits, a civilized negro state, whose independence is recognized by all the great nations of the world, exists in western and tropical Africa, is not without significance and surely contains some seeds of hope There is large amount of American silver currency in circulation in Western Ontario, where - it is I ' taken freely at its face value The Chatham Tlanet, having in memory the ' inconvenience and ei ueute the -country was- put to to get rid of the same nuisance some fi flteen years ago, warns the people not to encourage the use of these inferior coins, else some day Hie will find lliriusalve with a lot of it on tln lr liMixlf, which they III Imve to submit to heavy illmmint togil lid of Clmtlisin inrn Imins have lkn steps in the mutter already, and will likely ioium to sirrw-ment sirrw-ment to eiifurce afliml discount on all lliey waive Tlm Psrls t'iifreiHiinlfiil uf tlm lndon Timet, writing of tho prevailing tin 1 1 urns of trado In France, adduce tlm rot-rut railway returns as alTonllng slilklng proof of It to tlm 2n J of lt luontli, it tlm re ceipts of I lie Northern railway show a tie-rrnsMiof tie-rrnsMiof 4,1:1:1,00(1 f , or about 2S per rent, on Inst year's return, which Itself showed a dix reaxo as rotiirotl with tho figure fur previous yai Tlio Lyon railway lis tu meet a diNTeaiMT of t,4!l,ooo f , or nearly 9 percent ;

they stood on the principle that it was wrong to BPdure to tlin workingmen of Him country tho benefit of tho markets of this country in opposition to the manu facturers of a foreign state ; they stood on the principle that it waa wrong to extend the franchise to the young men of the nation, ami on the principle that tho Canadian Northwest was inferior to the blizzard-swept plains of ia kota and Kansas To-day in Nova Scotia they stand on, the principle that the federation should be broken up ; in (juobeo on tho principle that treason and rebellion and murder should not be punished, and that tho volunteers who risked and lost their lives to maintain the integrity of tho Empire wore assassins and pillagers ;

18870704: S informed Toronto, and Toronto kindly wired the Intel-llgence Intel-llgence back to us Tbe tidings is disheartening, disheartening, no doubt, but silvered over by the reflection tbat if these 7,000 had remained they might bave proved of that stripe who bow the knee to the Ilctal" of discontent discontent We bave a fair supply already of tbat species of bird that defiles Its own nest Meanwhile a few authenticated statistics statistics from Mr 8 would be in order For myself, I must believe that gentleman ; but all non-grlevancers hereabouts pronounce tbe statement a well, say a fib I Could I trust my own observation as I do Mr Silcox, I should give it tbe same name, or a stronger Desirable settlers are not leaving the country Some who, In their haste to gut lich, got Immersed Immersed in debt instead, and hopelessly mortgaged mortgaged through their recklessness, have slipped slipped over the line Others, finding the atmosphere atmosphere here too hot for such characters as themselves, bave done likewise Is this a proof of stagnation or decay ? Is It a reason for a "change of management?" I see thousands of farmers growing wealthy nil around me ; Indeed all who deserve to prosper prosper are prospering, and I bave yet to learn the first instance of one of these solid fellows pulling up stakes for Dakota or any other state True, though I live in the midHt of them, I may not have seen thiugH They may havo gone under cover of the night, calling upon Mr Silcox at Winnipeg with a fresh budget of woes Txie, there is a large Canadian population south of the boundary, but tbey did not go thither as a rule from tbe Northwest They settled there before this country was surveyed or open for settlement, not at all from preference preference but of necessity To their credit be It spoken, these earlier settlers upheld their adopted country Their correspondence wllh friends and relatives eastward portrayed the laud in bright, not dismal colors In fuct, bad tbey done otherwise Jonathan would have very properly kicked them out lung ago And so the number of Canadians multiplied, drawn cbieily from Ontario and other eastern provinces This clear stream is still flowing, 1 believe, but not from Manitoba ; what little they set from us is muddy More than this : Not a few of these people are now seeking homesteads in our country Why ? Because of our superior advantages Tbey know all about us independent of Farmers' union manifestoes, Winnipeg ebullitions ebullitions and Silcoxian orations Living on our borders, they have the means of forming a correct judgment from personal observation and contact with our people, and tbat judgment judgment is in our favor The dismal bowl of the agitator makes the Dakotan smile, for he knows tbe facts of our case and his own Ho knows tbat our soil is at least equal to bis He knows tbat our taxes are very much lighter lighter than his own He knows that our railroad facilities are far greater than most Dakotaus enjoy, and that our freight rates are not high er than he payB He knows tbat in this country men do not live in daily terror of their lives from tbe devouring blizzard and the annihilating cyclone ; and bis eyes are turning this way With the European populations the case is quite other is ' No sooner have they read a just account of the country, than some damning "resolution," Winnipeg tempest or Silcoxian deliverance meets tbeir eye and spoils all When its own people paint it black, will strangers and foreigners in distant lands think the country white? Tbey will take it at its own word and give it a wide berth Capital will do the same Can tbe blindness of party or selfishness go further ? But Mr Silcox says this is not the trouble Hear him: "Tbe whole management of the -Northwest country would have to be much altered before tbat region would prosper " That's it You see it is not the immigration frigbteners or the cipital dcterera at all, but ' bad management," that is, "bad Government," Government," which, being Interpreted, means a Conservative Government Ah I there's the rub There can be no prosperity here so long as Sir John Macdonaid rules yonder yonder God' 8 noble endowment of this land goes for nothing so long as those Jones sit on the treasury benches The Hamaus still cry, A" II this availest me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai, the Jew, sitting on the king's gate " Weil, Mordecai lias been sitting sitting there some time; let up hope that some of tbe Hamaus may be hanged Terrible spirit of party, here stalking hand in Land with tbe besoured spirit of the boom," bast tbou come bither also to wither and to waste ? Some of us here, however, choose to think that this country hui been managed as well as a somewhat unmanageable country could be managed; and treated pretty fairly on the whole The country has been opened up at vast expense,' but not at our expense Tbe land laws are more favorable to tbe genuiue homesteader tbau are those of the neighboring neighboring States For so young a country our railway railway and postal facilities are remarkably good Very substantial and comprehensive comprehensive bave been the favors showered on us by the central Government, and I fail to see where tbe evil treatment or the bad "management" comes in True, we bave oskea some things which we have not yet received received ; for example, permission to break faith witb the syndicate in tbe name of the Dominion and in the interest of a foreign na tion ; permission to paralyze an enterprise in which the very life-blood of Canada pulsates, and whicb has made us wbat we are : permis sion to enrich a few Winnipeg traders at the expense of the whole nation ; in one word, permission to stab that nation to tbe heart This refusal is of course a part of the bad "management " It is ever the way witb spoiled children, They can't understand the "governor's" disallowance of powder and shot Sectional selfishness is at the bottom of our imaginary woes, and radical indeed will be tbe " change " that will save ns from our selves It is bard to save a man bent on self-destruction Of course I am willing to believe that some change of treatment may be desirable, something to let the wind off the poor old woman's stomach For real grievances Ireland stands first ; for fancied ones, Manitoba Anything rather than obscurity Since the day I first set foot in it, I bave beard little but groans Year in, year out, rolls on tbe melancholy music Quite intolerable would it be were it not for tbe sudden transitions, tbe striking alternations alternations in the movement; but the undertone of woe ceases never Favors received may remove remove tbe cause ; but they cannot stop the wan Manitoba Is like tbe old woman who found herself very thirsty as she lay tossing one night on ber bed in a hotel, next door to a gentleman's bedroom, who couldn't sleep for her unceasing wail, " Ochone, but I am dbryl" He arose, gave her a glass of water, and returned to bis bed, fancying the trouble at an end Not to, howe-'er, to bis dismay he found that the sleep-repelling sleep-repelling lamentation went on as vigorously as before, but varied into tbe retrospective : " Ochooe, but I wos dbry I " Everything trom tbe grasshopper to the syndicate is a source of woe Winnipeg ! in a chronic attitude of unrest and suspicion This centre of sore head bas no faitu in anybody anybody Norquay is a deceiver Scartb is a traitor Sir John a tyrant The syndicate a devouring monster, and each suspects his fellow The notable thing Is tbe celerity with which some Intolerable grievance is dropped, though unredressed," when another looms In sight promising choicer opportunities to the agitator Who now ever hears of the famous " Bill ot Bights t" That cow ran dry At one time it is canned fruits At another, agricultural Implements Then tbe scbool lands Iniquity Again, the swamp lands enormity Then a grand rush Is made for Hudson's Bay Lastly, a milted dash down the Red Hlver valley to the haven of the oppressud Yesterday the cry was "On to Ohurohlll!" To-day It Is "On to Pembina!" The central authority Is set at naught; and open rebellion once more threatened There is in all this more energy than dig nity I suppose Mr Silcox would call it the energy of despair ; to mo It seems like the energy of " A furious maniac slinging llame " The spectacle Is as pitiable as It Is ridiculous ridiculous We are fast becoming a laughing stock to the world Blow after blow falls on tbe bead of this devoted land, not from without but from within Compared to our own, the band of Jack Frost has -been light upon us Our cradle was rocked in rebel-lion rebel-lion Hardly had tbo child left the cradle when the evil spirit of Mammon "boomed" him delirious Slowly con valescent, the " Farmers' union " dealt him a terrific thump Then a second second insurrection, fomented by designing men not residing In Old Canada, " plunged him fathom deep in brine ; and now a third horror on tbo horizon, a cloud " like a man's hand," soon, 1 suppose, to grow " And topple round the dreary West, A looming- bnitlon frlugtd Willi lire " And all for what ? A " monopoly," without which this country were still inaccessible ; echoing the bellow of the buffalo not tbe hoot of the agitator: "excessive rates," uever yet shown to be excessive I Beyond a certain mark Parliament Interferes It bas not Interfered Why '! Because, though necessarily Inch, they aie not excessive Does not everybody know that without tbe so-called so-called " monopoly clause" no syndicate could have been found ; no road built ; no Winnipeg created ; no theatre erected wherein to strut and pose I As If we only discovered t he existence of such a clause after nur arrival here I As if we ilid not know long before low it must tend t pinch us As if this very pinching had not been tery choerfullv contracted for by ns, to escape the keener lite-long pinching that threatened us on tbe declining or unattainable homesteads of the liaat Incredible that honorable men should threaten rebellion unless their rulers deliberately perpetrate a deed ol dishouor aud downright cruelty that would consign the name of Canada to eternal infamy, not to mention its traitorous unpatrlotisru For, wbat is It these men a-k ? Simply tbat the nation turn thief in the first place, reverse its whole policy in tbe second place, and, in the third, cut the hoop that holds the staves together, that our very life-blood should flow out to our neighbors if only Winnipeg might sip a cup or two extra as it passed Of course tbe Government simply scouts tbe monstrous idea; ergo, say Silcox and Co , "tbe whole managemeutmust be changed 1 be misrulers ol Canada, wbo, nevertheless prefer building ber up to bene fitting tbe States, and wbo think " a bargain's bargain's a bargain," must make w ay for men who would betray her interests and make "ducks aud drakes" of her obligations Tbe world is asked to believe tbat the Canadian Pacific railway is deliberately crushing crushing the people here, as if tbe very idiot could not see that not even ourselves bave a greater interest in our prosperity tbat has that company company No man or class of men bas any such interest in tbe development of the Northwest To accuse it of laying crushing burdens on the people, therefore, is simply to charge it with detigns on its own life In other words, tbat the syndicate consists either of suicidally inclined maniacs, or of financial dunder-beads I shall not believe that they wish their own treat enterprise to fail, or that (he wisdom of Winnipeg Winnipeg would contribute much to Its success Possibly Sir Ge:rge h Cm know as much about railroading as do even the firm of Silcox Silcox & Co Our welfare is theirs This is our guarantee, aud it ends the controversy There is no alternative You must either believe tbat the company bas tbe welfare of Manitoba at heart or that it has taken leave of its senses Mark tbe significantly tender style in which Mr

It means tbat five mil lions of people shall put themselves in tbe power of sixty millions 1 It means national humiliation, tbe admission of failure in the midst of success, a detestable sycophancy, sycophancy, the posture of tbe mendicant I It means ttat Ottawa shall take her orders from Washington, and send tbe shells hiding through London ! Tbat a foreign powergsball dictate to England's daughter bow she shall behave towards ber own mother I It means democrary with its evils, from Florida to tbe Pole, tbe burial of our highest hopes in the tomb of Monarchy on this continent I And all for what ? For a few very problematical iotertrade advantages 1 Is this not madness ? The native-born Canadian without a country ; what he once fondly called bis country, in the dust, betrayed, conquered I How many will vote for tbis ? Again THI AGITATION IS CAUSELESS Canada is prosperous It is an unpatriotic movement, gtving the country away in more senses than one It is an unfortunate occurrence occurrence when the Dominion has just gathered herself together and girded her loins for high endeavor Such is the moment chosen to turn her eyes elsewhere; to seduce her from her noble purpose of self-development ; to persuade persuade ber sbe is ill, and should call in Dr Jonathan ; to invite her to surrender much of what she holds most dear for the doubtful advantage of alliance with neighbor, wbose would bs the gain and the glory, hers tbe disappoint ment aad tbe shame And for even tbis she is expected to stand as a suppliant at tbe door of tbe White House! Tbe Republic fleets a sublime indifference She bas grand things to give us, but we must receive them hat in band But, suppose our material in terests will be promoted by commercial union or annexation, (which I deny) does it follow tbat such union is desirable ? It has been said that "real prosperity is tbe coveted destiny of a nation " True ; but what constitutes ' real " prosperity ? If this is to be measured by material standards alone, who can deny it to tbe Republic? Her march to material greatness baa been marvellous much swifter tban it would have been under monarchical rule So far, so good But here two questions questions arise wbicb must admit of an affirmative answer, or tbis material prosperity falls far abort of "real prosperity," and shrivels to insignificsnce : (I ) Will it endure ? (2 ) Is it sufficient while it lasts ? Only one of the factors of "real prosperity," though important, important, it is not the chief 01 far profouuder significance are those of A IfOBAL AND POLITICAL COMPLEXION, on tbe soundness of which depends tbe per-manenoe per-manenoe of material grandeur itself Rome was once the synonjm for tbis species of greatness wealth, luxury, expansion, Intellectual Intellectual vigor, empire, bbe fell, for her heart was corrupt Tbe stoiy of all defunct empires is told in a phrase material greatness, greatness, undermined by moral rottenness civil!-cation civil!-cation of the intellect without civilisation of the heart On this mine sits tbe Republic One of ber own writers pictures ber as " the most corrupt, and, perhaps, tbe least cultured of tbe civilised nations " Terrible indictment indictment of democratic tendencies! For tbis nation is still a child in years Sbe Is not an upgrowth from the deeper depths of humanity as most other nations have been, rising on stepping stones of their dead selves to higher things " She did not, as did her mother, merge by a slow evolution from barbarism to civilization No She started in lutein gence and integrity on a level with the high' est If fallen from this high estate, what has caused the decline? No barbarous vandal has swooped on ber to fling back her civlli zttion The germs of moral decay are in her constitution Already Is her beauty marred with furrows deep and Ineffaceable A few years ago another American wrote a book entitled 11 Are we a Nation of Rascals 7 in view of the wholesale State repudiations More than a dozen States bad got rid of their debt, totM tune of hundreds of millions, by simply declining to pay! Nor bos there been tbe faintest indication of any national indignation or sense of shame at the nefar ious procedure! Is this a symptom of vigorous moral health? or does it tell of deep-seated disease? Does Canada aspire to be a sharer in this infamy ? Of course all honorable Americans and they are counted by millions deplore the --xistence of facts Use tbis : but they are powerless te prevent their recurrence This is tbe terrible con sideration Herein lies the darkest count against a pure Democracy it smothers its best children Tbe bigher and nobler the class of citizen, the weaker its voice in the affairs of the nation In the roar of tbs mob every finer voice is drowned Is it not notorious that in most of the cities civlo robbery is ex pected as the regulation tbing ; and endured as inevitable with all tbe muteness of des pair? Does a system of government which both tolerates and engenders such a state of things hold a long lease of lifo ? Manhood suffrage is a sufficient guarantee for the long evity ot tbe evil ; but who gives security fur tbat of the natiou ? Plainly, I have little faith in the final success of this republican experiment, it is Beset with perils TUB AGENCIES OP DKCAT ARE AT WORK already This form of government in favor able to a very flexible expansion and swift development : tbe oak of permanent empire Is of slow growth A 'dominant idea in tbe world to-day is expressed in the phrase criumpnant democracy " Tbat America bas finally and favorably solved and settled tbe problem of republicanism is taken for granted, and the hallucination has rolled like a tide over the nations, shakine everv throne Most powerfully has it aided that social and political uurest in Europe which threatens extinction to the very name of monarchy Yet it is merely a chronologi cal mistake One century of national existence, existence, though attended with tbe greatest ma terial prosperity, is too short a test In my opinion, me nepuouc is only just entering on the gravest portion of its trial Let us Indicate Indicate some of its perils Money Is worshipped In a commonwealth that bestows no titles as a recognition of lit erary, professional, military, or other merit what avenue to distinction is left save the ac cumulation of wealth V Tbe late Dr Draner himself an American, treating of the decline and fall ot tbe Roman Umpire, significantly remarks tbat when wealth comes to be tbe only mark of social distinction, national col lapse is not far to seek Tbe cant of the day sneers at titles; yet the ambition ambition thus crowned may be noble and elevating ; the scramble for sufficient money to constitute distinction must be debasing or worse The demon of greed is abroad, blasting blasting all he touches and making the fevered lite scarce worth living If the "love of money be the root, of all evil," its giiai adoration it a good must leave small room for good Manhood suffrage Is fulfilling its mission in controlling and corrupting everything; paralyzing law, fattening the demagogue and stifling the best citizenship Lynch law, known only in tbe States, still flourishes, pro claiming lta verdict on the efficiency of the courts How cornea it to pass that Judco Lynch cannot breathe tbe air of Canada, even in her wild western regions ? Then, in tbe Western states and territories, if a man steals a horse be is sure of lynching ; if he shoots down a man, little is thought about itl Probably Probably Mormonism might still Hot in its abominations, unchecked and uncbided, bad it not threatened to control, over a vast region, the sacred ballot ballot box Yes, this precious toy, the centre and symbol of all human interest, is never out ot sight Year in, year out, tbe great electiunal cauldron bolls away ; quadreunially boiling over, with its unpleasant unpleasant fumes The very air is heavy with poll- tics To see tbe names of "candidates" growing in tbe leaves of the forest would rcarce su prise one There are two things in tbis Republic a wild race for money and a blizzard of politics that never blows quite over What a wretched ideal of tbe purpose of life!

Tbe thinness of tbe line between liberty and license attracts most of these Convicted of fiendish crimes, they may be led to the scaffold ; but it is with a hesitating step and a trembling band, two to one of the population deprecating tbeir righteous punishment?

I will tell you I stood to-day in one of the noblest buildings that is in the possession of any nation I stood today today in Memorial ball ; and from the walls I saw looking down upon ma the handsome faces of young men who gave their lives for tbeir country I went into the hall, and I saw that the building was erected in memory of the brave young men who fell to perpetuate perpetuate bureau liberty That is what I understand understand to be national obligation, from your standpoint ; and when ell tbe records of the corporations tbat bare come into existence, aud all their wealth shall have perished, the history of these heroic men will remain and will be banded down to your children as a heritage of which yourchildren will be proud You ask me what do I mean by national obligation to Canada Why, I simply mean tbis : Tbat while tbere is a desire for tbe largest measure of reciprocity with you, I tell you that no system that points to discrimination discrimination against Great Britain will ever succeed You cannot expect, when you do all that you have done for union, tbat there is no union sentiment with us You cannot txpecttbat yon will do every thing to serve the best interests of your nation and that we will not -guard against anything that would let in the wedge ever 'so sllgttiy that m'ght ultimately lead to a separation from the mother country Let me tell you that the Board of Trade in Toronto occupies the very same position that you occupy here Let me tell you what their position is upon this great question as expressed in a series of resolutions resolutions adopted by them: "We disapprove of any proposal to discriminate against Great Britain, whose protection we enjoy and under under whose fostering care we have grown to tbe enviable position that we now occupy among the people of tbe world " UfTEfiHATIONAL OOMPETITIOH Th Disaster that Would Attend a Policy oi Kon-interoourte (Si raul Pioneer Prett ) Tbe Kansas City Timet dealt Quite as sham ly as did the Pioneer Prett with the plea of jar josepn Mimmo, Jr , for protection to American railroads at the expense of the American shipper Tbe criticisms that have been made npon tbe argument of the question in these columns ignore, precisely at Mr Nlmmo does, tbe fundamental fact tbat the Interests of the shippers of this country are superior to the interests of the transcontinental rosds It is, of course, apparent that the competition of the Canadian Canadian Pacific it one bard to meet, because of the heavy money subsidies made to that road by the Dominion Government But there are tome other facts that appear to be forgotten What are the circumstancei on this side ? The first transcontinental roads in this country were subsidized as heavily by guarantees of the people of tbe United States , If they bad taken tbat assistance bonestly if they bad run tbeir roads for tbe benefit of tbe public, if tbey bad applied tbeir profits to the extinguishment of oblf-fatioDS, oblf-fatioDS, if no dollar of earnings bad been misapplied or privately appropriated, those early reads would be in a position, to-day to laugh at tba efforts of the Canadian Pacific, or any other line, to compel with them What was their first competitor ? Tbe Northern Pacific, a road which did not re-coirs re-coirs dollar of public money directly, but was aided only by a liberal land grant It might bave been argued quite as reasonably tbat tbe Northern Pacific could not compete for trade with the Vuion and Central Pacific, aud that shippers should be prohibited from sending tbeir freight over the latter line until the nwrosd had got upon its legs The faot shows that the Northern Pacific was abundantly abundantly able to take care of itself Looking a little farther we discover another line, built from St, Paul to Helena, and thus coming into into the field for a share of the business It has been built wholly by private private capital, without either money subsidy or public land grant Yet we bear nothing of a proposal to congress to pass a law prohibiting the St Paul, Minneapolis k Manitoba to carry through freights to Helena, except at such rates as tbe Northern Pacific may prescribe, nor any desire on tbe part of either competitor for anything but a fair race for business As to the shipper, we need not ask him what be would think of any regulation regulation or device tbat prevented him trom getting the benefit of the lowest rates afforded" by competition As we bave already neon, the transcontinental roads have already reached an agreement, including the Canadian Pacific, which not only enables them to muintaln rates, but to buy off the Piicifio Mail for an immense monthly Bubnidy And they are fully protected against tbe effects of Canadian cut rates by tbe ruling of tbe interstate commission, commission, permitting them, in such case, to charge higher rates (or the short haul than for tbe long Tbey are getting along all right It is the 'forgotten man," tbe shipper shipper of freight, who gets out of the situation what benefit there is in it It is be who would suffer by a policy of non-intercourse tbat wculd include not only tbe Canadian transcontinental line, but the roads which help to muke low rates between Northwestern lake points and the ports of the Atlantic seaboard, seaboard, and tbe lines over which tbe people of the Northwest have just established, by immense immense expenditure and notable enterprise, an independent line to the East by way of Hault Ste Marie Tbe advocates of protection to railroads at the cost of the publio are likely to run into a hetltby Northwestern blizzard

18880116: BEITISH MEEOHANT SHIPPING That Britannia rules the waves to a greater extent than ever before in her history history is made abundantly evident from an interesting comparison of Great Britain's merchant shipping with that of other nations nations and the relative increase of tonnage instituted by the London Times The shipping trade of England has now become become her most important material interest, interest, the receipts from this souroe being estimated at fifty millions sterling, or more than the total net receipts from her railways, considerably more than the gross annual value of her coal output, and almost as much as the present agricultural rent of the United Kingdom The growth of England's merchant skipping has been an almost uninterrupted one, despite the commercial commercial depression existing at times in the principal trading countries In the period between 1877 and 1886 the tonnage on the British register, both steam and sail, increased from 6,330,001) tons to 7,321 ,000 tons, the steam tonnage in the interval nearly doubling, the increase being from 2 000,000 tons to 3,969,000 tons The growth of steam tonnuge has been very rapid In 1800 the amount on the register register was 452,352 tons, and a quarter of a century later it bad risen to 3,000,728 tons, representing an increase of 10,500,-000 10,500,-000 tons of sailing tonnage, assuming one ton of steam to be equivalent to three tons of sail The increase of steam tonnage alone in the laist five years has been equal to tho total tonnage on the register in 1850, and the increase was not one of mere tonnage, but of greatly augmented tonnage as well, for in every direction there has been economy introduced, in the number of hands employed employed to navigate a given tonnage, in facilities for loading and unloading, and in the consumption of power generally for the attainment of a specific result Concurrently Concurrently with the growth of steam tonnage tonnage a decline in I hat of sail lias occurred Down to 1870 the Bail tonnage on the British register augmented, reacting in that year 4,500,318 tons, then a decline set in and at the close of 1886 the sail tonnage amounted to only 3,359,589 tons Mow rapid has been the substitution of steam for sail may be learned by the following following statement of relative tonnage : Total Per cent, tonnage Sail Sail 1840 3,724,107 2,636,688 1)7 1880 4,688,742 4,134,490 90 1888 7 321 335 3 359,689 48 It is a noteworthy fact, however, that during the last two years the new tonnage added to the British register has been divided almost equally between steam and sailing vessels, the former amounting to 347,000 tons, and the latter to 351,000 tons It is quite evident from this fact, concludes the Times, that in some trades sailing ships are still found to answer the purpose quite as well as steamships steamships They are preferred for several reasons chiefly because they are less expensive to purchase or to build, they cost less to navigate, in respect alike of fuel economy and of the labor employed ; they allow of considerably more cargo room relatively to their gross tonnage, and they are not liable to break down from accidonts to machinery, etc On the other hand, however, while progress in sailing vessels has been almobt stationary, as measured by the average time occupied in any given voyage, great economy has taken place in steamship working, so that the difference in favor of sailing ships is by no means so great as it was a few years ago Improvements Improvements in marine engines and boilers have reduced the average consumption of fuel in the best constructed ships from about 3j or 4 lbs to less than 3 lbs per indicated horse power per hour, concurrently concurrently with the attainment of a considerably considerably higher average speed ; and not only so, but other improvements in methods of working and in the appliances appliances used have enabled a steam vessel to be navigated with about one-half the labor employed at any rate in the foreign foreign trade so recently as 18(15 Under these circumstances, it appears to be probable that sailing tonnage will not long maintain its present relative position position on the maritime registers of tho principal countries of the world The supremacy of Britain in the carrying carrying trade of the world has been more than maintained in late years Of nearly fifty millions of tonnage entered and cleared at the ports of the United Kingdom in 1880 about 72 per cent, was British, while of fifty-four millions of tonnage entered and cleared in 1886 no less than 75 per cent, was British, the increase of entrance and clearances in the six years having been not only entirely in British bottoms, but in the amount of business done in foreign bottoms there was an absolute decrease in the period Taking the decade 1375 to 1885 we find that the total ton nage of sailing and steam ships on the registers of the principal countries of the world was in 1875, 14,281,000 tons, of which Great Britain lmd 6,088,000 tons, or 42 0 per cent , while in 1885 the total tonnage on the registers was 10,619,000 tons, of which Great Britain had 7,387,-000, 7,387,-000, or 44 4 per cent In that period Holland alone increased her percentage, more than Britain, namely from 2 8 per cent, to 7 7 per cent j the tonnage of the United State, fell off from 1,554,000 to 1,288,000 ton ; that of Norway and Germany Germany slightly increased, while that of Italy and France daclinrwl Tha total steam tonnage ol the principal merchant navies of the world in 1875 was 2,985,000 tons, Great Britain's share being 1,943,000, or 65 per cent ; and ten years later, out of a total steam tonnage of 5,931,000 tons, Great Britain had 3,970,000 tons, or 07 per cent , United States steam tonnage decreasing in the decade ,from 192,000 tons to 186,000 tons Another interesting test of Britain's maritime supremacy is afforded bya oom parison of the tonnage of all vessels that entered and cleared in the twelve principal principal maritime countries of the world in 1875 and 1880 - These countries appear to have had a total commerce of 143$ millions of tons in 1875, as compared with about 210 millions in 1880 The in crease o tonnage that entered and cleared in the interval amounted to 67 millions, of Which fully 16" millions, or 25 per cent, of the whole, fell to the share of tho United Kingdom It is also worthy of remark that the shipping trade of the United Kingdom, as measured by the entrances and olearanoes of vessels, was only a little less than one-third of that of the whole of the twelve countries ; that it was more than twioe that of the United States, nearly four times that of Germany, more than twice that of France, nearly six times that of Italy, more than six times that of Russia, and more than three times that of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark combined These figures, says the Times, at once demonstrate the preponderating preponderating importance of the United Kingdom as a commercial country, and show that its trade with the rest of the world is very much in excess of that carried on by any other country But what is of still greater consequence is the fact that the increase of Britain's foreign commerce is muoh greater than that of any other country Between 1875 and 1 880 the increase of British foreign trade was 10 millions of tons, while the increase increase in the case of the United States was only seven millions, that of Germany about six millions, that of Franco about !)J millions, that of Italy 3 J millions, that of Russia less than two millions, and that of Spain due mainly to the development of her mineral resources about 10J millions And the eleven chief maritime countries of the world, after Great Britain, have not only failed to keep thoir place, in respect of the carrying of their own foreign trade, between 1875 and 1886, but have absolutely lost ground, the most remarkable case of all being that of the United States, which only carried 21 ,J per cent, of its own foreign commerce in 1880, as compared with 31 per cent, in 1375 These facts conclusively conclusively establish, that Britain's maritime supremacy is becoming more and more in the ascendency THE SIX MONTHS CLAUSE, The Ontario Court of Appeals has rendered rendered a judgment in the Algoma election case upon the debated point whether the time of the session of Parliament skull be included within the six months within which the trial of an election petition must be commenced Section 32 of the Controverted Elections aot, which prescribes prescribes the time limit, lias been variously interpreted The New Brunswick judges unanimously, if we mistake not, and also many of the Nova Scotia judges, have held that the time of the session is to be included included within the six months within which the triul must be commenced, and the majority of the Quebeo judges have adopted the same view Two judges at least, in this province, however, and several several Ontario judges on circuit have held that the time of the session is not to be counted, and under this ruling have proceeded proceeded with the trial of election petitions, petitions, even though the six months limit bad expired, including the time of the session within the period The decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal coincides with the weight of judicial testimony and with the reasonable interpretation of clause 32 of the statute That clause declares that " the trial of every election petition shall be commenced within six months from the time when such petition has been presented," and is modified by but one contingent, namely, namely, "if at any time it appears to the court or a judge that the respondent's presence at the trial is unnecessary," then the trial is not to take place during the session of Parliament, and in determining the six months within which the trial must be commenced, the time of the session in the event of the court requiring the presence presence of the respondent is not to be inoluded It has , been assumed in, many cases by petitioners that the session does not count, and, acting on this assumption, they have neglected to apply for the fixing of a day for the trial within the six months ; but it is obvious that the exclusion of the time of the session is a matter to be determined not by the petitioner, but by the judge, who must be satisfied that the presence of the respondent at the trial is necessary necessary before ordering that the trial shall not take place during the session, and by virtue of that order excluding the duration duration of the session in the computation of the six months within which the trial must be commenced ' One of the main objects of the act is despatch ; the obligation to press proceedings rests on the petitioner ; he Is plainly instructed that the trial must take place between six months of the presentation of the petition, and failure on his part to apply for trial within this limit puts him out of court The option of delay rests wholly with the judge j there Is no option on the part of the petitioner petitioner The Supreme court will shortly pronounce on the point, and its opinion is likely to coincide with the Ontario Appeal court, and the weight of judicial inter pretation of a very clear section If the Picton Liberals wanted to bring disgrace disgrace upon their party they could not have proceeded in a more business like manner than they have in making tha liberation of the convicted convicted bribers in the Prince Edward election case an occasion for a party demonstration It may bays been thought by many that the punishment of these people was severe It certainly was unexpected But no party can afford to put itself on record as sympathizing with and honoring men convicted of deliber ate corruption of the electorate The original act was criminal ; the honor paid to its authors was both criminal and foolish Tha powers would certainly bave no slight task to discharge if they undertook to force Prince Ferdinand out of Bulgaria against the will of his subjects Why he should b disturbed disturbed now, after being left in possession so long, and after showing by his policy and conduct that he is not unworthy of the posi tion of ruler, it would not be easy to say The rumor, however, appears to have been without foundation If it were the case that the powers could be brought to unanimity on any question, there might be some hope of fruitful understanding hereafter But It would bs a bad augury if they unitod as one who follows a multitude (though in this esse it would be the many following one) to do evil The commercial union propaganda in this country is evidently costing some one a considerable considerable amount of money 'Commercial union document No 9," a twenty page pamphlet, is being extensively circulated through the mulls at present We do nt know what the exact

Dakota's wind-swept plains seem to have suffered most severely, that territory being apparently peculiarly subject to these visitations While the ther mometer in the Canadian northwest has been

productive corn land baked brick-like in tbe eun, and the plants died before they repro- - duced themselves Extensive areas of wheat were not worth cutting Direful dixaster xhtiag over the fair laud Men who tilled in cumbered acres lay awake nights to think of their cares How did the larger portion tf tbe newly arrived arrived emigrants fare? Povorty, armed with judgments as with a club, stalked among them and struck them down in scores Crops were lost on a scale that threatened to bankrupt bankrupt them Chittlos were laid on cattle to obtain money with which to pay interest interest on real estate mortgages Winter Winter approached, and men mid women who lived in caves dug iulo thu baoks of timber-less timber-less creeks, or in frail, unplastured houses, mostly of one room, sat and uilontly looked at one another, atraid to voic; their fears They bad but very little, if any, money 1'lentiful supplies of healthful food were scarce They were almost destituto of fuol, and winter was gradually stalking southward from the froz9u plains of Manitoba Dally the people gathered dry cow chips which lay on the rauge where herds of cattle grazed a few years ago But cow chips are poor fuel, and the supply was limited Jf a settler discovered discovered a place where tbey were plentiful he kept his knowledge to himself and secretly visited his fuel preserve as a hunter does a valued game range These settlers come from regions whore coal and wood were cheap, and they conld hardly realize that men and women could lose their lives fur the want of little coal Men talked of fuel when tbey met They dreamed of piles of coal and long ranks of cord wood when they slept The Tolles realized that they bad to have coal Tbey bad lust their crops, and were as poor as their neighbors To buy oal it was uecessary to take a portion of the small sum of money tbey bad sacredly laid aside to meet the expenses of the coming of a longed-for child For several days thoy hesitated to kdraw from this store; then a sharp, cold night, during which the north wind blew keenly, warned them to prepare, bb winter drew nigh The next morning John Telle bitched his Incumbered horees to bis mortgaged mortgaged wagon and drove 30 miles to town to uy coal Arrived there he found many other ottlers, all of whom were poorly clad and In financial straits, in town after fuel All told the same story: Cow chips to burn, no solid fuel, almost a total failure of cropland hardly any money These hardy men dtscumed the possibilities of d ingor which lurked iu coming coming blizzards freely, as there were no women there to be alarmed There was no coal In tbe ti wn They surrounded the empty bins and demanded and there was menace in thbir tonesof the dealer why he had no coal "CL-ntleraen," the doaler said, I ordered 000 tons of coal weeks ago Tbe railway company will not haul tbe fuel for me " lie waa silent for an instant ; then, In further explanation, explanation, said s " Vou see, the directors of tbU corporation own the controlling interest la th coal mines la the Reeky mountains and in Missouri, on tho output of whloh we depend for fuel This railroad oompany will not supply cars to free mines The corpora tion has resolved to put up the price of coal, and thoy are deliberately creating an un natural scarcity of coal so as to be able to charge higher prices for it at the mines They are preparing to form a Western coal trust " "Great heavens, man!" the Bottlers ex claimed as one man, 11 we raised nothing this year We have neither grain nor stock to sell Our teams and tools are mortgaged We cannot raise any more money How does the company expect us to pay increased prices tor met 7" 'That is just tbe trouble," the dealer replied replied bitterly ; "you produced nothing this year You supply no outgoing freight Ho you must pay extra on incoming supplies At least that Is the way I look at it See hare, men," be added sardonically, "you have mortgaged your land and chattels and spent the money in Improvements and in living Don t you see that the railroad corporation can make no further pront out of you ? The sooner you are forced to quit the land the sooner other men, who will afford better plucking, will occupy your places That is about the size of tbe thing," he added, as be nodded his bead emphatically at them The settlers, who bad listened to the words of wisdom which had fallen from the coal dealer's lips, howlod with rage, hat tboy were just men, and their hot anger was dl rscted against tbe railroad corporation Tboy clambeied into their wagons and rode slowly home, uursing their wrath the while Ar- rivod there, tin y shook their beads wbon their wives looked into tbe empty wagon boxes, and said savagely: "There is no coal in the town, The railroad company will not haul U for us, curse them I That night, and for many following nights, and In mauy shanties and dug-outs, the fuel question was earnestly discussed I'eople went to bed at dark to save the small qiinn tity of fuel they bad stored up They lay abed late of mornings to aid in accomplishing the same purpose Hut tbey might as well be in bed as anywhere else, as there is no work to be done In Western Kansas and East' tern Colorado during the winter, and, then, one does not eat so much when he remains long iu bed As tbe delightful fall days, warm and pleasant, continued, men aud women smiled at one another whon thty mot and euld hopefully : " Maybe we will not have a severe winter, and we will got through nicely We will not have to pay an extra price for cool We have had a great fright about nothing " And thoy nodded their vouug hoods to indicate their courage and bopefiilm ss As the settlers talked and thought and acted, so did John and Mary Tolles One morning, a few weeks after John had re turned conlloss from town, the south wind woe blowing briskly wbon they awoke It wblHtled rather mournfully, as Is thu wont of vupor-laden winds, around their small house They arose aud dressed, uud walked out into the prairie The sky was cloudless, but hazy Though it was early in tbe morning, the air was unpleasantly warm Tumble weeds rolled past tbelr hut and chased ouo another northward over tbe plains A meadow lark sat on a dead sunflower sunflower stalk and sang sweetly as the tall, slender stalk swayed to and fro The short brown grass nestlod and whispered A few blue-bottle flics buzz:d noisoly around tbe bouse All nature seemed to proclaim that spring was near at hand It was late De cember Ihe young people laughed and talked gayly ' Winter is overt" tbe brave, young wife exclaimed joyously "How warm it in Tbe meadow lark is hailing the approach of spring He is calling to his mate How foolish we were, John, to be alarmed about fuel We will do nicely now, and next year we will make a crop and have a plenty of everything " And thu young woman sang aloud Ah, how little the young know of the climate of the Kansas and Colorado plains How ignorant ignorant they are of the hardness and cruelty of nature That afternoon a low, dark line of clouds appeared above the distaut northern horizon, tbe southern sky became overcast, and heavy manses of vapor-laden clouds rushed northward The air continued to be warm That night, shortly after the Tolles had gone to bed, a warm southern rain began to Ml, and tbey laughed and talked of the coming crop as they heard it patter on the roof They had not noticed bow reluctant their dog had been to leave tbe house, nor bad they noticed that their few cattle bad come up early In the evening As tbey talked of tbe future they beard a low, faiut roar, as Uiough a distaut sea foamed on a Bandy shore Kteadily the roar grew louder and louder The dog howled mournfully outside The cattle lowed plaintively The Tolles sat up to listen Then with a crash tbe wind whipped into the north Tbe rain drove furiously against the frail bouse and blew through tiny cracks in spray on them Their bouse shook and trembled Ousts of wind blew down tbe stovepipe and caused the light ashes to fly in jots out of the openings in the stove door, as though the stove were a mighty puff ball that was squeezed by unfoon hands The dull sound produced by falling rain was speedily replaced replaced by the sharp rattle of ball beating against tbe bouse Then Ice particles and fine snow began to sift into tbe room Loudur and louder tbe storm raged, until the air resounded with the voice of enraged nature It grew colder and colder The young people trembled in bed They piled all their clothes on their blankets, and there tboy lay and shook with cold through the night Before morning they realized that spring bad not arrived Oray light penetrated into tbe room through its coated windows and announced that dawn bad come Tbe bands of tbe clock marked 8 The Tolles arose Tbey were wretchedly cold Thoy built a fire out of corncobs and cow chips, which hardly gave sufficient heat to warm tbe stove As they breathed frosty columns of vapor issued from their mouths as horns Outside was an awe-inspiring arctic scene that chilled them to look upon The air was filled with ice particles and snow which swept almost horizontally through it An apparently solid and endless mat of suow two feet tbiok moved rapidly over tbe frozen surface of tbe eartb The utmost extent of vision was about twenty-five yards And tbe loud voice of nature never ceased to roar over the storm-cursed land The Tolles were experiencing experiencing their first blizzard As they suffered, suffered, and through suffering added to their scanty store of knowledge, tbelr hearts burned with anger at the brutal wickedness displayed by the managers of the railroad company, men who knew the land aud its climate, in not hauling coal to the towns along their road for the settlers to buy They quickly realized the folly of attempting to keep the room warm with the fuel they had They resolved to hoard It to oook their coarse food, bo, after making an unsuccessful attempt to get to their stock, and in making which tbey very nearly became lost in tbe storm, tbey went to bed One day, two days, passed, and they suffered suffered physically and mentally the while When thoy awoke on the third morning the sun streamed redly through the ice-coated eastern windows Tbe blizzard bad passod, the sky was cloudless It was Intensely cold Tbey arose, dressed themselves, and opened the door to look out To tbe extreme of vision vision tbe plains were white All tbe ravines were drifted full of snow Every familiar land mark had disappeared Tbe cattle shed in the ravine was almost covered with tightly-packed tightly-packed ice and snow After eating a scanty break fast of cornmeal and bacon the Tolles dug a path to their cattle and watered them andfedtbem Then they carried straw to their house and rolled and twisted it into bundle to burn in their itor( but it afforded little beat, and tbe bouse was very cold Tbn next day the wind blew from the south, and It seemed to be colder than the north wind had been The day after that tbe snow began to molt, and In two days it had disappeared, disappeared, excepting In the ravravs and draws And the meadow lark returned aud sat on the sunflower stalk and sweetly proclaimed that spring was coming soon The young people realized that thoy oould not live through another blizzard without a supply of coal But it was thirty miles to the railroad station, and John hesitated to drive that long distance on tbe mere chance of getting fuel On the aftornoon of the fourth day after the blizzird a neighbor rode by their house, and as be passed he shouted to them that there was coal at tha town Tbe young man determined to go to town the following following day The nrxt morning was a delightful delightful December day on tbe plains There was not a particle of wind The grass, coated with boar frost, glistened iu the sunlight as though millions of tiny electric light glowed on tbe prairio Tbe horse were fed and bitched to the wagon The young husband camo to the bouse to get money and some food to eat while on tbe journey Mary counted counted tbe sacred hoard It amounted to $11 Hbe gave John $5 with which to buy coal "John," she said, hesitatingly and reluctantly, reluctantly, "John, if you will sUep in the livery stable Id town it will save some money - You can take one of the blankets ; I will not need all of thorn, as the weather is so warm and pleasant, and you will be back to-morrow, you know," "Of course I am going to sleep in (be stable," John said, pleasantly " But I guess I cau find bedclothlng there I am afraid to take any from you " He looked at the sky attentively for a few minutes It was clia to his eyes He did not notice the faint giay mist hanging just above tbe plain away off to the north Again be looked at tbe sky, and saw no sign ' 1 do not bellove it will storm," he said,- "and if it Is chilly to-night you cn cover up with our clothes " He took tbe blanket from ber outstretched arms and tossed it into the wagon He leaned over her, and as hor arms twined around his neck he drew ber close to blm aud kissed ber lovingly and whispered, " I'll be back tomorrow tomorrow afternoon dear " Bhe was loth to let him go Hhe clung to him and kissed him repeatedly He laughed nervously and very near to tears as he gently loosened ber arms, saying lowly, "I must go, Mary, or the coal will all be gone before I get there " He clambered into bis wagon and drove oft Tbe duy continued warm But the young wife was lonely Hbe was oppressed by the solitude of the plains Her bouse seemed to be aband ned Hue called her dog and walk ed over thu desolate plains, Hhe gathered cow chips In ber apron Hbe fed and water ed the stock Hhe attempted to kill time, and the day seemed to be the longest and most weailsoma she bad ever experienced Tuat night she lighted a lamp and sewed on small garments Hbe smiled as she worked Apparently Apparently her thoughts wore pleasaut With out a particle of warning the wind ruined out of tbe north and struck the house with terrific violence Tbe air became cold almost in stantly But there was no driving snow The poor young girl listened to the bowling wind for an Instant, then she bowed her head on the table and cried bitterly, to be aroused from ber nervous grief by a blood curdling chorus outside the house, as though 10,000 devils were exulting there The dog's hair stood upright on bis bock, and he growled savagely Light footfalls pattered around the house Then the dtvilish chorus again souuded Mary sat with blanched face and faintly throbbing heart, looked through foar-oxpaoded foar-oxpaoded eyes at the door, where she fancied she heard enquiring snitu Her dog became wildly excited and barked furiously Mary was so greatly terrified that she no longer felt the cold Bhe weut to bed to hide Hhe covered ber bead with a blanket, as a timid child does, and lay awake for hours listening to tbe coyote's frightful chorus, and listouiug she fell into adreainfu', troubltd sleep ; It was morning, ana a few fukes of fine snow shot through the air Mary arose and fed the cattle Hbe aoadered at tbe intensity of tbe cold The northern sky wat black with frozen anger Hie built fire in tbe stove and boiled a little corumeal for bur breakfast, a portion of which Bhe gave to tbe dog It grew colder aud colder The snow Hakes were becoming more numerous, aud appeared to be smaller tbau they were when sue arose, aud tbe wind gathered strength as it blew Mary glanced at the clock, Its hands marked "John is at the top of tbe second divide by this time, she said Ten o'clock Tbe snow was falling freely and almost horizontally The mercury marked far below zero The noise of tbe storm was terrific Hhe became anxious about John But there were neighbors' houses at intervals on the road, and he would surely fiud shelter in one of tbem And maybe be bad not left town Hhe became nervous Bhe ceuld not eat Hbe thought of her Ohio home Visions of great piles of firewood and bins full of coal arose btiote ber Bhe conjured up the old gray house and tbe beehives and the apple trees, and her eye lilted with tears bhe grew colder aud colder Hhe crawled Into bed and covered herself wltb the blaukets Hhe grew colder Hbe arose and stuffed tbe stove with cow chips They burned freely but threw out little beat Fearful of ber life, she called aloud for ber husband The shiver ing dog wagged bis tale In answer and came to her Bhe grasped the axe and chopped a portion of tbe floor Into firewood and burned it Bhe chopped the furniture into firewood and hovered over tbe stove with extended bands as the hard wood burned Darkness fell on the plains She lighted ber lamp aud beld her half frozen hands above tbe glass chimney to warm them Hhe got ber sewing and tried to sew Her fingers were too still to handle tbe, flue needle she worked with, and the small white garments which she was making slipped from her lap and fell on tbe fl'jor By midnight tbe storm bad passed and tho bright stars shone on a snow covered eartb Tbe wind fell Mary continued to teed the stove with bit of bard wood furniture until the room became sufficiently warm for ber to go to bed Tbe mattress lay on tbe un- chopped floor close to the stove Hbe lay down and covered herself with the thiu blankets Bhe could not Bleep Hbe pictured ber husband lost in tbe blizzard bow glad she was that she bad given blm the blanket, Then she saw him sleeping comfortably In a neighbor's bouse, and the wagon partially filled with lumps of coal stood outside bow good it looked Bhe argued with herself and tried to be cheerful, but there was a strange, unwonted pressure on her heart which would not be reasoned away At Intervals she slept fitfully, and visions rolled through ber brain Hhe was np eaily, just as tbe whitish- gray light began to disappear Bhe was strangely weak and nervous, and she marvel ed at her condition While she was trying to build a fire she heard the crunching of Intensely Intensely cold snow as wheels rolled over It Hhe arose and walked to tbe eoor, saying : "Thank God, he has come at last I" Bhe opened tbe door and saw tbe team of borser, witb low banging heads, wearily approaching approaching the house No driver sat on tbe wagon seat "John is walking behind tha wsgon to keep warm," she said as aba pressed her bands to ber bosom to quiet her throbbing beatt Tbe tired, storm-beaten horses slowly approached approached tbe bouse Bbe saw that tbe lines were tied around the dashboard John waa not walking behind "The horses have run away and left him," she whispered with white Hps 11 That is II He will come presently " , Tbe horse halted in front of the door She grasped tbe door post with her hands to keep from falling, and gazed wiidly through terrified terrified eye far beyond (ho wsgon ovet tbe frozen plains Bhe shrank from looking into the wagon Her white face became deeply lined Her heart was compressed as with slowly-shrinking slowly-shrinking bands of steel "I know he has remained behind," she whispered lowly Then with a supreme effort she grasped her nerves strongly and walked witb firm stride to the wagon and looked over the high sideboard Bbe staggered back with the infirm steps ofyge Did Bbe see her husband? No Bhe saw a frozen corpse with its legs drawn up as if In pain Bhe saw a distorted face with frozen lolling tongue, and eye socket filled with snow, and tbe long black hair matted with snow and Ice And the arms of tbe corpse were extended extended and the outstretched Soger grasped at the bottom of the wagon as though greedily trying to clutch lumps of coal that were not there Mary tottered into tbe bouse Bbe crouched on the mattress for a moment, and looked wonderingly at tbe small, white garments which were lying on the floor Bhe felt tired, very tired, and sleepy, tro Bhe tried to rouce herself to action, trie! to realize her loss Hhe reproached herself for not caring for the exhausted horses But she was so tired and cold, and sleepy, that she resolved to lie down for a minute before she attempted to do anything She lay down on tbe small ma t and f eMy pulled tbe blanket over ber Hhe closed her eyes and nestled a little, as though to obtain more comfort A warm glow pervaded her entire body and she was mildly surprised that she could have thought the morning was cold Bhe was motionless for a few minutes Then a rare smile played around her white lips, ber eyes opened wide, she looked through the open door, and far to the eastward, where tho rising suu reddened the heavens The Kansas Ufa and all its hard, cruel realities disappeared as a troubled droam, and she saw ber husband standing under a full blossomed apple tree in tbe old orchard Dees were humming In tbe overhanging limbs Tbe Miami river shone as a broad band ot silver Tbe westerly bills were bathed In warm, rosy light Her husband smiled at her, and with outstretched band beckoned her to come to him Mary smiled radiantly In reply and went to him Frank Wimikson

negotiations had been pending fur some time for an amicable settlement of the Chinese question question They bad beea suspended during tbe summer in consequence of tbe absence of the Chinese minister, but had now been resumed resumed and were reaching completion He understood, In fact, that a draft cf the proposed treaty had been transmitted to tbe Chinese minister to-day, containing such modifications of existing treaties as would bring about the complete exclusion of that class of emigrants to which the people of the western coast objected It was only just to tho Chinese Government to say that there was no disposltloa on their pirt to stand in the way of such an agreement and he believed there was a strung prospect prospect that within a month we would have a treaty which would cifnctuaily dispose of the question It would, of course, be necessary for Congress to enact legislation to carry out the purpose of such a treaty and, therefore, It was desirable that tbe bills now pending before tho bouse should Dot be hastily acted upon Speaking of tbe pending treaty with Great Britain, Mr Belmont said as the matter bail been so widely discussed through tho papers he thought it only just to the administration that It should be known that uo clause permitting tbe extradition of a cltl ou of the IJuited States for any political effonso was included in the treaty sent to tho Senate If there was any such provision now under consideration it must have been inserted as an amendment In the Senate, Ho declared emphatically that there was no cUtise In tbe treaty as submitted to

the furnace, furnace, which is simple aud Inexpensive It will be difficult for our iron masters to believe believe that under tbe new process iron ore, after submitting it to tbe ordinary smelting process, is taken direct from the furnace to the rolling mill and turned into sheet Iron, yet such is tbe case, there being to my knowledge, three furnaces in this country now in full operation and working with great success There can be but little doubt that this new invention will create a perfect revolution revolution in the manufacture of charcoal iron Whether the process can be used with

from the cold blizzard driviug the snow, aud becoming dangeious for man and beast to travel, to tbe almost imperceptible wind tbat causos the water to How down the creeks for several days The first Chinook I experienced was in the winter of 180, when tbe thermometer thermometer registered a change of 18 0 In as many minutes, and the domestic cattle that bad remained remained in town during the short period of cold weather went olf alone to the prairie for pasturage Having spent a few days In Calgary Calgary neatly every winter since coming to the couutry, I was peculiarly impressed, after the railroad had reached there, when a telegram arrived from Wiuntpeg stating that the thermometer thermometer registered 40 below aero, and there we were feeling quite comfortable In summer clothing, and tbe fires In the bouses all out, save those used for cooking purposes I bave seen men playing cricket and engaged in out-door occupations on Christmas aud Mew Vear days Ploughing has been done in January, aud potatoes planted in March Still, we cannot rely upon these precedents, as the winds are Irregular Last winter we had a period of oold weather tbat lasted seven weeks, with not more than four warm days during that period, and the present winter is similar In its character Were it not for these winds, tbe prospect of our country being suitable for grazing purposes would be very serious I bave been asked If these sudden changes In temperature were not very injurious to the health of the settlers, and Invariably I bave answered, Not to my knowledge " I have had one singular experience on this matter, which may be worth recording From the time whea I buried tbe first person in MacLeod MacLeod new cemetery, every funeral at wblcb I bave officiated or attended there has been when the cold was over 20 below zero Meteorological records kept by the settlers in different sections of tbe country would prove a great help to our interests and be an important addition to science The data thus collected would asBlst scientific students at solving tbe difficulties in connection with this important subject A man's wife should always be the same, especially to her husband, but If she is weak and nervous and uses Carter's Iron Pills, she cannot be, for they make her 11 feel like a different person," at least so they all say, and their husbands say to toot CHARLES MEREDITH & CO , STOCK BROKERS, 87 St- Francois Xavier streets Montreal' CHARLES MEREDITH, member Montreal Block Exobauue, representing Irwin, urkbh to , unicao, Wathoh Bkos , New York Stocks and grain bought and sold for Cub or on Margin la 7 MONEY TO LOAN at all times aa Drat clan property or farms within nay miles of Montreal Low Interest Interest anil very favorable terms of repayment

18880220: A CAPITAL SPEECH Cowan, of Gait, Depiota the Clreatnoim or Canada and her Happy Condition Mr At the annual banquet of the Canadian manufacturers held at Torouto, on Wadries- day evening last, the following excellent speech was delivered by Mr Thomas Cowan, of Gait, in rosponse to the toast " Fair Cnuadtt " It is well worthy of careful perusal at the bands of our readers : After some in troductory remnikshesaid: I have not langu- aco sufficient to respond to this toast as 1 would like to tlo Before going any further, howover I will take the opportunity of thanking thanking the Toronto members of the association on behalf of their brother members from the country for tbo exceedingly kind manner in which you have entertained us your countrj cousins This is the first occasion In the life of the aSFociation in which our annual gathering gathering has taken the cbaractor of a festival, and now at last our opponeutb may say that we are bloated monopolists (Laughter ) To ronto Is a city fighting for the development of a Canadian national sentiment which we give expression to on the present occasion I am Canadian and Canadian Canadian is all I expect to be, and I am happy to know it We have devolopid a Canadian policy, and all we want now is to put a curbstone to what we have done by developing developing a Canadian national sentiment (Applause ) We admire any man who is proud of hi country no matter whore ho comes from, whether from the sunny Mouth or from Greenland' Icy mountains Wo admire admire that man for his national pluck, and though it be carried too far at times the offence offence I one which leads to virtue's side You may know from my accent that I am a Canadian Canadian with Scotch proclivities (laughter) and I will tell you a little story of Scotch conceit A little boy In pointing out his native town of Paisley after culling over with pride the name of many eelobrated Paisley men, ddod, "And I was born In Paisley myself " (Laughter ) That Is Scotch national conceit, and we, whether we come from Sentland England or Iroland, bring it with us, but wane not laying that aside, lot ui endeavor for our new country to build np such a na tional sentiment that any young Canadian travelling in any country of the world may say with pride, I was bora In Canada, and arn a citizen of no mean country, (Applause ) liet us CONHtniB TUB Ami, Or C4SADA

was in Scotland I went to see St Mary lake and expected to see a magnificent sheet of water with all the poetic surroundings which Sir Walter Scott bad given it And when I stood in presence of it after coming from Canada I thought X was looking at a pool (Laughter ) Comparing our country with the United State we find that it ia 60,000 square miles larger without Alaska and 14,000 square mllos larger than the United state and Alaska combined Yet as Canadian wo are always coming to the conclusion that we are a small country country Why the seven provinces of the Dominion are 17,000 square

Speaking of the past political his tory of the country, which ti him means a livalry between contending parties, he says "tho record of those rivalries and controversies controversies will be gathered

18880228: REPATRIATION O CANADIANS Mr Burgess devotes a couple of paragraphs of bis report to this suhjoot, being of the opinion that an extensive movement among Canadians settled in Dakota to return to Manitoba and the Northwest exists He quotes a lotter from Duncan Sinclair, tbe Dominion Land surveyor, who, with his family, left Manitoba for Dakota several years ago, because, as he says, he was discouraged by tbe summer frosts and because of the Canadian Canadian Pacilic railway monopoly In his lotter he expresses tbe opinion that care on tbe part of tbo farmers will enable them to escape tbe effects of tho frost, and certainly the improved improved farming of last year and its results results would indicate that Mr, Blnclair is right In respect of the railway, " Manl-tobans," Manl-tobans," be says, "would find railway monopoly monopoly as grasping here as any part of Canada " Canada " The following quotation from Mr Sinclair's letter is given: "The terrible blizzards which we havs had for the last three weeks have sickened me of the country more than anyth'ng else It la hard thing to be on the prairies of this country without she!

18880314: KNOCKED OUT BY A STORM The Empire City (Jets The Full Force of -the Blizzard BUSINESS AT A STANDSTILL All Railways Blocked as Xcvcr Rcforn The I oks I'nt nt Ten Millions lluny Frozen to Icatli Nkw Yoiik, March 13 New York, in the expressive language of the boxer, was completely completely knocked out by the blizzard yesterday, yesterday, and is to-day in the condition of a man struggling back into vitality and action after a stunning blow Tho city is still dazed and a good many of its functions are still completely suspended There aro hopeful signs, however, in all directions The big railroads are blocked in all directions, but tho elevated roads are beginning to show symptoms of renewed activity Sleighs arc taking the places of the almost useless waggons in die streets and trains aro run with something like regularity across the East river bridge There has been a very big boom in pedestrianism within the last forty-eight hours nnd thousand of estimable persons have found that a pair of legs are very useful articles at a pinch The storm reac hed the height of its fury yesterday afternoon, afternoon, but it was not until tin's morning, perhaps, when the air was clear and it became possible to look out, that the full extent of its power and the mischief wrought by it could be appreciated appreciated Many years have elupscd since Such Scenes of Desolation have been witnessed in the streets of New York and Brooklyn In almost every ease the traces of sidewalks and curbs had hewn obliterated, and nothing met the eye but drifts of varying depths, some of them as deep as five feet Front stoops in thousands of instances, especially on the north side of the streets, were buried out of sight Here or there was a stranded waggon or horse car, bearing mute but eloquent testimony to the power of tho elements Sign posts and awnings are down in every direction, sonio of the largest and heaviest of them completely completely blocking the sidewalks, and on ail sides arc to be met tingles of wires, telegraph, telegraph, telephone and electric; light, in all of which there may lurk a subtle but terrible clanger There is a great demand for snow shovellers and no laborinir man who can buy, beg or borrow a spado or a pick need want remunerative employment The Brooklyn Brooklyn horse cars ran longer than those of New York yesterday, but they too gave up the battle battle early in the afternoon aud this morning all the tracks were in the same hopeless condition as those in New York, buried two or three feet under the snow To make matters worse, the snow on top of them is becoming rapidly solidified into a miss closely resembling ice, whic h will last until May if it is not speedily broken up When the horse cars will be running again, is a question which is vitally interesting to everybody, for the Elevated road, although it ran with tolerable regularity this morning, is, of course, utterly incapable of allVirding accomodation to the mighty host of Brooklyn Brooklyn nwn who do business in New York Most of these who do not live near the lino of the Elevated road, boldly set out this morning to wulk to the former on tho bridge and a good many of them had to do a vast amount of wading More they reached a laatcn track In the business 'part of the city walking was tolerably good In ono respect, however, Brooklyn folks were worse off to-day than yesterday, for the ferries wero almost Stopped by If use lee Floes and the bridge cable had not been got into woiking order, although trains were run over both roads by the aid of locomotives Many hundreds availed themselves of the permis sion of the bridge authorities to walk over the structure The whole roadway was clear soou alter noon, abiggang of Italians having been set to work ujmpji it Some hundreds of men nnd boys who did not care to walk over the bridge, and got tired of waiting for tho ferries, walked across the river between Fulton ferry on one side and Martin's stores on the other By hook or by crook tho residents residents of Brooklyn, or most of thorn, contrived contrived to make their way to New York places of business, but the New Jersey men were in just as bad a plight to-day as they were yesterday, yesterday, and perhaps were not quite so well off AH the roads running out to suburban neighborhoods were snowed up as tightly as ever, and even the most fortunate persons persons who livo within easy reach of the ferries experienced great difficulty in getting across the river on account of tho ice At the Signal service station, Sergt Dunn said : "The worst of the storm has passed us, and is now central somewhere olf the coast New England is getting what we had yesterday, yesterday, only probably a little more of it Wo Lave no reports from any point in New England, as ull of the wires are down in that section of the country The total amount of snow which fell in this city during tho storm yesterday was just two feet on tho level The highest velocity recorded by tho w ind gauge was fifty miles an hour between 1 and 2 o'clock this morning The temperature temperature as recorded by our thermometer at 5 o'clock this morning, was 5 above aoro, This is the lowest point reached by tho thermometer thermometer during tho storm " A Coal and Milk Famine The complete blocknde of traffic of all kinds in the streets has interfered with business very greatly iu the hotels, restaurants restaurants nnd eating houses It is impossible for the managers of these institutions to get supplies of coal nnd provisions sufficient for their needs There was no milk received at any of the railroads, and the stock of condensed condensed milk has been exhausted No trains had arrived ut tho Grand Central depot this morning since Sunday Drifts in some places nro nine to ten feet high, and it is impossible for trains to get through Hundreds of people were caught in the snow drifts on the other side of tho Harlem river and staid in the trains all day yesterday and last night in the bitter cold Tho greater pait of lhe passengers preferred trusting to the traitis to risking their lives in tho snow nnd wind, but this morning they decided to risk it and made various shifts to get to quarters During tho night the steam gave out and tho psoplo had to keep in motion in order not to freeze Hunger waB added to the discomforts, but a speculative Mott Haven man reached tho trains with a supply of whiskey and sandwiches sandwiches which were eagerly taken A milk train from Riverdalo was caught with the others nnd this was rilled quic kly by tha pnssengcrs Tho Elevated roads began early trying to put trains through and made gone! time to the northern terminus, but had dilH-culfy dilH-culfy in getting back and engines wero sent cut with only a single ear This was A Mere Prop in the Backet nnd the waiting crowds at tho stations turned turned away nnd cither went buck to their homes or talked down town At about 11 o'clock two cars nnd occasionally three car trains were run through to tho City Hall station nnd the traffic steadily improved Tho drifts r n the west side of Broadway wero in in my places nt least 6 feet high and only a narrow space between tho shop fronts anil tho drifts was left for people hound f r their places of business At times for ncuilv a who'c llo;k only the tops of their heads- were visihlo above the snow Hero and there along tho rcadwny and in tho side streets loaded trucks were standing evidently abandoned yesterday yesterday It seems impossible to get Broadway in condition to run cars under a week The snow is easily two feet deep on tho level, well lacked down and in some places it is packed just, as hard and fully four feet deep Business in the dry goods district is almost at a standstill No mails have been received from out of town points since yesterday At the ticket offices of the railways railways placards are displayed to-day announcing announcing that "nil trains arc abandoned," etc Seven pilot boats went ashore in the blinding storm of yesterday They will probably all prove complete wrecks A sorrowful crowd of pilots crowded the office of the pilot commissioners commissioners to-day and told of their awful experience experience of yesterday Many had their hands so liaelly frozen that amputation may be necessary George D Barremoro an importer importer of hops, was found frozen stiff in a snow bank on Seventh avenue this morning He had started for his office yesterday and was overcome by the storm The body of Annie H Fisher, aged 30, was found last night frozen stiff in the hall way of a house on 30th street The Telegraphs Crippled The condition of the telegraph and telephone telephone wires is quite as bad as yesterday Nearly 300 men are at work repairing the wires in this city Occasional messages firm the West and South have been received received The company expects to be able to resume by to-morrow Hundreds of poles are down in and near this city The tele- graph companies have never been so seriously seriously crippled before It is estimated that flic storm caused a loss of at least ten million million dollars to New York's railroads, business business men and wage earners At 8 o'clock td-nighta fine penetrating snow was still falling, but early to-morrow morning an army of men nnd carts will try to clear up certain of the most-needed streets Hour by hour additional casualties are being reported 1 y the police, and the victims whose arms or legs have been broken are almost innumerable

completely Blockaded Neveral Vessels Keported Lost Railways Railways Koniewlint Relieved Nkw Tonic, Mareh 14 The battlo against the snowdrifts, which was carried on all day yesterday und throughout the greater part of last night, has effected a considerable change for the better in tho condition of the two cities of New York and Brooklyn, so far as tho means of internal communication aro concerned, and tho streets of both began this morning to show some signs of renewed activity The New Yorkers had an advantage advantage over their Brooklyn brethren, for they had four elevated roads running witli something something like their ordinary regularity, and an immense number of business men wero thhs enabled to get to their offices with comparative comparative speed and comfort, whereas in Brooklyn Brooklyn there is only one elevated road in running running condition, and that was so vastly overtasked overtasked that it was of little appreciable benefit to anybody who did not live almost on the line of it Thousands of Brooklynitos trudged manfully along the various thoroughfares thoroughfares leading to tho East Iliver bridge and seemed to enjoy tho unusual exercise The side streets everywhere are still in a very bad slate, both in this city and Brooklyn, and miles of sidewalks are still covered with drifts, through which tho occasional wayfarer wayfarer is compelled to flounder shoulder high Broadway in New York has been partly cleared from Madison square to the Battery and all the principal nvenues will soon be opened if no more snow comes along In Brooklyn, Fulton street has been partly cleared for miles One of the Chief Inconveniences arising out of the present situation is the wni t of milk The supply of fresh milk gave out long ago and there is reason to fear that the supply of condeused milk will-not hist much longer A great many households, too, especially among the poorer classes are suflcring for want of coal There is plenty of meat and flour, so that the city is not likely to suffer from starvation, even if another snowstorm should befall it But tho improvement improvement in business in general is very slight The retailers, of course, lind plenty of customers, but the big wholesale men who depend on the mails, the telegraphs and the railroads for their transactions arc helpless helpless The tangle of telegraph wires is almost as bad as ever, and it is difficult to communicate even with neighboring towns Slaten Island Blockaded It is impossible to get any word from tho interior of Staten Island unci tho amount of the danger done by the storm cannot bo ascertained ascertained It has been learned that three trains on the Bapid Transit road are snowed in at Aunandale, about ton miles from Staplcton, and the passengers are being cared for nt an inn Several calamities on the water die reported The ferry boat Maid of Berth was sunk at her dock at Staten Island, but all the passengers were saved Alex Bennett, John Leo und another employee of the Singer company, at Klizabcthport, wero lost in crossing Staten Island sound ou Monday Monday afternoon Nailed Without Cargoes The wires between this city, Sandy Hook,

18880316: WHAT PRODICES HOITUMIN BLIZZARDS In this tame condition seems to lie found the valuable immunity which western Canada, Canada, and the northern border of the United States enjoy from those fearful blizaard that devastate snuthern Dakota, and make cattle and cattlemen shiver even on the coHst of Texan These winds all come from the far Northwest, and have blown, perhaps, a thousand miles across Canada before they beccnie blizzards Hut their course over the fc'shkatchewan, Qu'Appollo and Assiniboiue plains, and down the Winnipeg valloy, is continually impelled First, the country is everywhere uneven and often broken by respectable hills; second, largo areas of it are covered with a scrub of bushes, or dotted with copses copses of trees, all of which chee-k and divert the gale ; third, these winds are moving steadily up grade, aud their speetd is as continuously continuously checked by friction agaiust the earth, as is that of a railway train climbing a gradient A wind will blow down hill faster than up, just as a stone will roll elown hill easier than it can he pushed up Finally, the air in the north is so nearly the temperature temperature of the gale that it is not' sucked forward forward with greatly accelerated speed, until it nearB the warmer latitudes where more heated heated and rarified air is rising from tho more southerly plains, aud this cold northern air is drawn in to fill the vacuum But by the time the "norther" has reached Nebraska Nebraska it finds itself blowing across plateau lauds, at the top of the hill, where there is not a bush nor tree nor range of hills to check it, and the vacuum is close in front It has been a respectable wind in the Northwest; Northwest; a terrible gale in Montana; in southern southern Dakota and Nebraska it becomes adonth-dealing adonth-dealing blizzard How do tho people who live in tho West like this climate' They universally praise it and Jaud especially its hcalthfulness They speak ol it as extremely extremely stimulating and conducive to good spirits and courage The secret of this is its dryness dryness The atmosphere is bright, and when in winter it is very cold there is seldom any wind Let a man take ordinary care of himself, himself, and he will live longer and grow stringer on these prairies than anywhere else in the worhi A peculiar exhilaration of body and soul belongs to the eliinite, especially in and about the Rockies, which is the CHOICEST OK RKOIONS FOR CAMl'IN 'l, excursions and sporting trips The senses are so quickened by the clear, vivifying climate of the western uplands in sumin T, that an outdoor life is tenfold more pleasurable pleasurable there than it woulil be in the En-t And then one's sleep in the crisp air, after the fatigues of the day, is sound and serene Vcu awake ut daylight, perhaps, readjust your camp blankets, and want again to sleep The sun may pour forth from the " golden window of the East," and Hood the world with limpid light; the stars may pale aud the jet of the midnight sky be diluted to that pale and perfect morning blue,into w hich you gaze to immeasurable depth ; the air may become a pervading champagne, elry and dedicate, every draught of which tingles the lungs and spurs the blood along the veins with joyous speed ; the landscape may woo the eye with airy undulations of prairie or snow pointed pinnacles lifted sharply against the azure, yet sleep claims you That very quality of the atmosphere which contributes to all this beauty and makes it so delicious to be awake, makes it equally blessed to slumber Lying there in the open air, breathing the pure elixir of the untainted mountains, you come to think even the confinement of a flapping tent oppressive, oppressive, and the ventilation of a spruce-Lough spruce-Lough bad Mr Ingersoll was warmly applauded on the conclusion of his lecture

examination proved to be of a very practical and important character He has lived iu Prince Albeit for a number of years where he is a practical farmer and is now n delegate to this city for tho purpose of urging the extension of railroads to that point He mentions the water shed between Prince Albert and the navigable lakes as a chain of river and lakes within the scope of enquiry of the committee, in his belief, presenting presenting no engineering difficulties to the connection Tlie country is wholly alluvial, covered with trees, diciduous and evergreens of considerable size, tho climate being the same as at Prince Albei t, and (lie sod suit-aide suit-aide for production of all cereals The lakes in the north abound with fish, whitelish being tho principal,' and a variety of trout, weighing thirty to forty pounds, being also found in great numbers iu the northern hikes Tho settlements in the neighborhood of Prince Albert and to the north number about 5,000 people, most of whom are engaged in agricultural pursuits, although at present there is no market for the grain and vegetables which they produce The nearest railway communication is fhe main line of the Canadian Pacific railway at Qn'Appille station, or Troy as it is sometimes sometimes called, about an equal distance to the point to which in Manitoba the northern railway has now been built iu a straight line from Prince Albert is about 22(1 miles and by a line of route about 300 miles, thus excluding by the cost of land carriage all possibility of exporting wheat or vegetables The northern slope of the water shed is entirely entirely free from cyclones in summer ami blizzards in w inter, the yields of grain and grasses are as good as in any part of the Northwest and the country to the north of the Saskatchewan water shed, so far as he is acquainted with it, is quite as good us that to the south of it, w hile it has the great advantage of more building timber, anil lakes and streaiin which abound in fish He states that if tlie present imputation of the I'rinco Albert region could feel assured that one year hence their surplus grain could he exported, they could produce, if this summer was the same as last season, about 300,000 bushels over what they need for home consumption He spoke of tlie aspliult uui districts on the Athabasca, and has seen gold from that river and from the Yukon, knew of existence of salt, and Is lieved iu the existence of silver, large deposits of gypsum, moulding sand, lime and other stone well fitted for building He stated that the navigation of tho Saskatchewan Saskatchewan river, from its mouth to Edmonton, was open from April to OctolKT, and well fitted for the navigation of properly constructed river boats The climate is very healthy and all the vegetables which were raised were entirely free from any of the pests known in the eastern portion of Camilla There were no polutoe bugs or anything of that sort He mentioned the fact that the winter frost was an aid rather than a drawback drawback as it assisted in preparing the ground in the spring and admitted of roots going far down into the soil He stated us un ex-uniplc ex-uniplc of this that he had given up the growing of long varieties of carrots, because of the difficulty in drawing them out of tho ground Anything would grow in Prince Albert that would grow iu the central part of Ontario and his belief was that it would bo a surer crop iu the Northwest He stated the average time of sowing wheat to be April 17 and that the first frost was generally in October, October, although instances have been known ol frost as early as the 1 7th August He said he hud himself grown red fife wheat between between the 17th April and the 17lh September, September, and considered that if it were true that the Russian wheat could always be depended depended upon to ripen in the time that ws claimed for it, that no farmer planting that wheat need fear the effect of early frost He knew that there was a river and lako connection connection between the large lakes 100 miles north of Prince Albei t to the north of the watershed, which connected the other lakes and rivers with the Athubaskn He knew nothing practically of the navigation of tho Athaluiska, but believed that Prince Albert would be found to be the most direct way to connect the arable and pastoral lands of the great region to the north of that place with -Uie trunk line of the Canadian Pacific railway railway and other railways Pure water was obtained by digging from eight to twenty feet, and tlie water generally of these northern northern lakes and streams was exceptionally pure The committee will meet to-morrow and succeeding days to continue taking evidence evidence of several witnesses who have

March, 1887, in the hope of bettering his chances of re-election, is revived It is not an improbable rumor, now that Lord fc'aokville's blunder has embittered Democratic Democratic feeling against Great Britain, fiightened the President' ) friends with the fear that he mnv theroby lose a largo Irish-Ame can vote, and rendered necessary in their opinion some strong and tangiblo evidence of Mr Cleveland's hostility to all things British If he proclaims the act now on the Statute book in its full force and entirety, tho result-will be absolute absolute non-intorcourse of trado between Canada and tho United States, and for the serious loss and confusion to the commerce of both countries that would follow such an act of folly he can throw ssonie responsibility on tho Republican party, which was mainly instrumental instrumental in securing the passage of tho measure It is not a littlo disquieting to think that the friendly and commercial relations relations of Canada and tho United States can bo suddenly snapped to win a sectional sectional vote in a political contest, that the maintenance of the cordial intercourse between our neighbors and oursolvos may hang upon tho whims of tho demagogic leaders of the Irish-Amorican element Mr Cleveland has within a couple of days held close intercourse with mon who profess to control this vote, and if he has heeded their counsel wo must

ambassador as to how his franchise was to be exercised in deciding a domestic domestic issue The exigencies of the presidential presidential election have precipitated Mr Cleveland's action and compelled him, to fave his chances with tho anti-British voters, to take a step that for harshness has few precedents in diplomitio usiigo It would have been bettor that Lord Sackvillo had voluntarily

18890405: T11E QUEBEC BRIDGE Another deputation is to wait to day upon the Dominion Government to urge the immediate construction of a railway biidge across the St Lawrence at Que bee This work would, of course, in ona way be of considerable importance to the Ancient Capital Tho expenditure of the sum the bridge is expected to cost in its immediate neighborhood would give a much needed temporary boom to its trade, and the facilities for reaching the city fiom the south shore would bo permanently improved But there is n:ore than a Quebec view to take of this question The country is asked to expend expend upon this scheme a sum estimated estimated at the least at six million dollars, and certain, before the completion, completion, to be largely enhanced Are tins advantages to the country such as would warrant the increase of tho national debt by such a sum ? Would the tratlio presenting presenting itself, at a reasonable toll, pay inteiest on the original cost, and tho charges of maintenance ? Those are questions that have to be satisfactorily answered before Parliament can consent to vote so heavy a subvention, The Quebec people themselves have not fhown their faith in their own claims; the company formed to undertake tho work received subscriptions of only ten thousand dollars IVoji tho merchants of tho city whoso trade is presumed to warrant so vast an expenditure expenditure That certainly is not an encouragement encouragement to the Dominion to invest in a (structure the traffic of which my be estimated estimated from the fact that up to the pro-tent pro-tent it hiis never

EKGLA NWS Fill END, KING JOHN The reported death of King Johannes of Abyssinia recalls tho remarkable part that Prince Kassai was called upon to play in one of England's great modern military enterprises Some of our renders renders may remember the timo whon King Theodore was a daily subjoct of conversa tion on the streets and a frequent thomo for comment, more or less to tho point, in the press At that time Abyssinia was one of the least known of countries, and the obstinate potentate) who nai deeply resented a slight to his dignity as a sovereign as to defy tho power of Great Britain was only know n by name and by vnguo reports of his doings His riso to supreme power was not, however, without features of lomance, and though ho closed his life under a cloud of de'eat and ignominy, there was a stage in his career, when his power and reputation reputation made him not tho least enviable of semi barbarous rulers He was of noble futility, fairly well educated, and early began to show ability as a leader of men Putting himself at tho head of tho organized organized opposition, ho successively de feated all the troops seutagainsthini, and finally had himself crowned as Theodore III In lfiliO, tho British consul, Mr Plowden, who was strongly atta diod to Theodore, was mortally wounded Tho King took a terrible revenge on his murderers Captain Cameron, tho new consul, arrived at Masto vah in 1 802, ami soon after reached Theodore's eainp In October of tho Bimi year Consul Cameron was dis:n ' sod wiih a letter to Queen Victoria, which was handed to the officials of tho foreign iffice in February I8!3ii For gome reason it was not answered, About August, 1803, Captain Cameron returned to Abyssinia, without the Kind's authority authority At the same time Theodore was chafing at the failure of tho Queen to answer his letter Doubly ofTondo 1, therefore, ho had Cameron, ami Messrs Stern and liosenthal cast into prison Intelligence of what had taken plane reaching England, Mr Hormuzd R issa u was despatched with a letter to tho King, but not for over a year did ho rnuoivj any satisfaction Ho was then invited to visit the King and treated with courtesy courtesy and hospitality, but a change accur-red accur-red in Theodore's mind and the released prisoners were again thrust into confinement confinement About tho samo timo Mr Flal was despatched with a letter to tho Queen asking for European workmen and machinery For a timo tho prisoners prisoners were well treated but latterly they suffered from both cold and huugor, as well as constant apprehension Mr Flad's return with a reply to Theodore's letter saying that tho workmen and machinery would be sent as soon as tho prisoners were set freo produced no effect, In 180" it was recognized that force would have to bo used According by an nimywas especially equipped for the servico with Sir Hobort Napier (now Lnid Napier of Magdala) as commander Tho story of the campaign has beenofton told It has long bei n part of our inili-taiy inili-taiy history The landing took place on the 7thnf January, 1808 the task to be accomplished being the transport of over ;i(),W0 men over 400 miles of mountain-ous mountain-ous country to Thoodorc's fortress at Magdala On tho 1 1th of April the stoiming of that stronghold took place und Theodore's dead body was found within Tho success of tho 'expedition was largely duo to tho timely aid of Prince Kassai, of Tigi o Had ho boon hostile, instead of friendly, tho issue might, indeed, have been sadly different Before leaving the country, tho English English General showed his grutitudo by a gilt of ordnance, small arms and ammunition, of which the happy receiver made such g-w luso that he not only declared and maintained his independence but made hiiusolf Theodore's successor In 1872 ho was crowned King of Abyssinia at Axuiu, On tho throno ho never forgot that to England's England's opportune present ho was largoly Indebted for his good fortune England did not always reciprocate th ' barbarian's barbarian's good will His conlldonco in her friendship must sometimes have boon Kev orely tried For years tho Egyptians proved a thorn

18890420: GOVERNMENT SA VINGS HANK'S A year ago the expectation was aroused by Sir Charles Tuppor, then Minister of Finance, of a reduction In the rate of interest paid on deposits in the 'iovcrmnent savings banks Tho -Finance Minister had taken authority fiom Pailiutnent to rcduco tho rate bo low 4 per cent , and at tho same timo obtained power to issue a large loan in the Jxmdon market, a portion of ttio pro-reeds pro-reeds of which it wus hlntod might bo requited to pay depositors in tlio (lov eminent savings banks who desired to withdraw their balances because of the lowering of tho intorost late Nothing, however, has yet been ilono in this direction, and tliore contin-uot contin-uot to be paid to tho publio creditor In Canada a rate of intorost unduly high when compared with tliut paid to tlio public creditors abroad, or to tho ratos paid l y tho chartered hunks In round number more than forty million dollar of the people' money Is hold In tho liovernment banks, upon wnieh intorost to the amount of I,(iOO,00 Is a inuully paid Now the last loan placed In London London is costing less than H percent , anil it is fairly presumable that money can be borrowed thero to pay off" the da positors in tho savings bank at as low a rate, in which case tho operation operation would effect a saving In tl e annual interest charge upon tho public public levriiues of tho considerable sum of J '!(iO,0( 'O, So long- as the Oovornmont was reipiiied to pay 4 per cent, intorost for its Bi itish loans, the argument that Canadian creditors ought to receive as much for their money as those abroad had force, but that argument no longer applies To-morrow by a stroke of tlio petl, almost, tho Finance Minister can make a reduction in the interest charge of the publio debt of at least $3U0,(M!0, a sum suflicient to pay the interest interest on a capital charge of $'J,00:),(M3 ; or, to put it in another way, the Government Government could make a capital expenditure of $9,000,01)0 in enlarging the St Lawrence Lawrence canals without adding a singlo penny to tho interest account by simply equalizing the rate paid on savings banks' deposits to that paid foreign creditors Iho fear that a large withdrawal of deposits would follow upon a reduction in the rate of interest is probably unfounded unfounded In the first place, the Government Government pavings banks are patronized by a good many people because thoy afford al solute security ; in the next placo, a considerable proportion of tho deposits are drawn from localities whore no chartered banks exist and whore, therefore, competition for tho money does not prevail j and, lastly, the rate of interest paid by the chartered banks during the past two or throe years has been lower than by the Government institutions No doubt tho depositors would clamor loudly against a reduction of ono per cent, interest, but aftor all the depositors are a small minority of the whole peoplo, and it is to tho general general interests, to the greatest good of tho greatest number, tho Governmont should look It is manifestly unfair that one hundred thousand depositors in the savings banks should anuually draw in interest from the rovonuea from general taxation three or four hundred hundred thousand dollars more than would be paid if tho money wore borrowed abroad It is well to encourage habits of economy and thrift among the masses, to place within their reach safo and convenient convenient receptacles for their surplus earnings, but theso objects may bra quite os effectively attained with a 3 per cent, as with a 4 per cent, rate of interest interest on deposits, tho more especially wince the chartered banks, less widely distributed and affording less advantages advantages in some respects, pay the lovvor rate Another reason often urged for reducing reducing tho interest on deposits in the savings banks is that the present rate diverts money from the chartered banks and therefore from the channels of legitimate trade If, however, this a jument is worth anything, it means that no competition competition with chartered banks ought to be permitted, and that not only the Government, but tho private, savings banks ought to be abolished It is", of course, presumable that a lowering of the Governmont interest to 3 per cent, would cause the transfer of some deposits deposits to the chartered banks, and thereby thereby increase the resources and loaning loaning power of tho latter, but tho amount that would bo exchanged exchanged would, we are convinced, convinced, be unimportant Tho chartered banks today Jiavo abundant resources; their deposits have, never before been so large as now, id they have continued to augment in spite of the payment of a lower rate of interest than in the Government Government banks The strong argument to bo pressed upon tlie- Finance Minister for a reduction in the interest rate is that all the money the Government requires can be much more cheaply borrowod abroad, tliat the continuance of a 4 percent, rate to depositors constitutes an unfair discrimination, discrimination, and imposes an unnecessary charge upon the public revenues for the benefit of a favored class The body of unother murdered bnho was found on tlio street yesterday Tliere will be another inquest to-day That will end the chapter In crime It always does In Montreal It must have been tho Wilneim' fodder famine maker that discovered In tho Municipal Municipal lleporta evidence tliut "tho population Of tlio Eastern Townships has decreased, not increased " , Hero Is Dakota with another plague Mice are so plenty In the blizzard district that tho rat market has gono up, and turns and tab-bys tab-bys are being shipped west In carloads and sold at $2 apiece How thankful tho Ontario Ontario exodusters this year must ho that thoy disregarded tho Grit papors'ailvlco and nmdo their new homes in Manitoba, Borne oua in tho West has stin ted a si are over tho danger of smallpox or other disease developing on ocean steamship hutwoon the thna they pass the G rosso Islo quarantine station and tho landing of their passenger at Montreal, Homebody wants a situation Are healthy Immigrants more exposed to Infection Infection during a tool sail up the river than during the same timo spent In crowded Immigrant Immigrant ran Mr Mercler object to the oltlement of the Ontario boundary as proposed by tho Dominion Government, though It Is accepted accepted by Mr, Mowat, Tho chief principle of Mr Merclor's politic I that tho romoval of any subject from the arena of dispute In which tho Federal Government 1 likely to le a party to the proceedings 1 thing to bo steadfastly opposed Hut tho publio I getting tired of a party that can only curso Its opponunfs' proposition Tho proposod settlement of tho Ontario bouiidarle a accepted by the federal and local Government, will give tho province a seubonid of somo hundred and fifty miles on the Hudson's Day, and add to it ao knowlcdgort territory an Irregular area hav lug southern baso of about four hundred miles, the eastern and wcntern boundaries converging till the Hudson' Day coast It reached, whore they are about one Lundrod end forty mllo apart The eastern limit I straight line drawn due nurthward fn m the head of Lake Temlscaraingiie, which i probably the part that excite Mr Morcier' opposition There does not, however, seem any good ground for dissent The territory ie pot agriculturally valuable so far as the greater part of it is known It is not a timber region, and It mineral wealth 1 piobkmutical Poor or rich, however, it miy as well belong to Ontario as to any other nu mber of the federation If Quebec want more, the Dominion can throw in any extent extent of territory out of East Maine Tho Hon

woallior conditions have furnished reasons for a further heaviness In gtain, and especially In whoat, whllo lower freights have mostly operated to depress corn ntid oals, The argument for tho lattor was overwhelming, because of the small consumption consumption co the fatni, which was the dlroct ton sequence of tho season, Tho almost tin preccdeuled absence of winter weather in mouths when it Is expected to put lu an appearance is cue of tho chief eaiiseB of weakness in all curetls, and every day from this that the cold wave holds aloof lessens the probability of its coming at all on tbiB side of summer heats Already some are counting confidently on the uninterrupted enjoyment of spring wctuber during the next three months, to be followed by an early and abundant harvest harvest It Is, however, dangerous to commit oneself to this theory, as nature has always furnished her own compensations in the past and can be trusted to do so this tims, and the only trouble is nobody can tell when It is a historical fact that most mild winters have been followed by severe weather just at the time when it was not wanted, and the crops have suffered In consequence consequence This may be an exception to tho rule, but analogies are against it, as the sun is gathering strength daily but be is a long way below Equinox, although the month iu w lilt h be reaches that point has ere this been maiked by blizzards of fearful intonsitv We are so nearly out of the wood now, as to justify a (-lion t of joy at having escaped its perils, and it goes without saying that if heavy frosts should come, each day's delay will only iimko the evil worso in the winter wheat fields and If deferred till the end of this month it means the failure of hall' the crop If the fronts hold off till the middle of March, the result would probcbly be even moro disastrous as tho tlalks, full of precociously formed juices, would bo burst assunder by the act of freezing, leaving the roots too much exhausted exhausted of their vitality to bo equal to the task of fmmlng another car-bearing stem, and nothing would be loft but to roaeed for another crop Of tho prospects In the spring wheat regions, no more can be said tbau that all is problematic, but a cold summer following a warm winter would find large quantities of grain unmatured on tho arrival arrival of frosts next winter The recent news from other continents certainly doss not favor the weakness In whoat hero The Blocks In the Uuitod Kingdom Kingdom arc low and there Is an ollicial eu-dorsemnt eu-dorsemnt of thej sometime since reported heavy falling off in tho Russian yield, a? also in some other parts of Europe The acreage in India Is conceded to bo less than that, of last year, and according to latest mail advices the avnrage yield promises to be poor for want of suflicient rain, and now comes the confirmation news that tho Australian Australian crop has panned out far bolow expectation, expectation, and for this reason soveral slilps under cbartor to carry wheat have boon diverted to other services It Is expected that tho twelve millions of bushels to be received received In Western Europe from Australia will not be delivered, and more heavy rain In California threatens to leave a small ox-port ox-port surplus thoro As was marked In our letter of a week ago, the 11 future of tho wheal maikot hinges most ly on the weather," nnii tli at statement holds good now, if wo hove no winter, and tho price, of whoat may sink farther if WO have yet to experience any really cold spell, for the bulls will not nctd any further encouragement to boldness In that event thoro would probably bo such a ruih to buy as Las seldom been witnessed in this or any other market, and' can only mtrgest that it may not bo wise to run the riik of getting caught on the short side in stub a storm Corn Is stated to have reached reached tho lowest point known since August, 18G2, and Hit n It was only brought over short distances to this market Home men In trade Fay they expect a reduction in the rail rates to bring a large increase In the receipts receipts ftilllclently so to force a further decline decline There may be some mistake about this, but lu any event the visible supply decreased decreased last week, and there was probably a much larger decrease In the quantities in transit by rail, which are not included in the statement, and a good deal of covering covering by the Bhorts was done , this week on the idea of larger receipts, and have been fully discounted before arrival Corn has "had no friends" for a long while past, but that fact does not prove an awakening to be impossible and thero Is room for a a snort Provisions are staggered by the fact of big stocks and the fear of larger receipts of hogs, the latter being favored by better country roads and good prices paid for bogs compared witli corn, but there are willing buyers of the product on overy slight do-cllnr, do-cllnr, and tho stuff is already so low as to moke it easy to carry large stocks, pending the arrival of orders from willing consumers of cheap meat , Chicago prices reported by Macdongall Bros , agents for A GeddeS Co , Chicago, on

sections sections lire good with numerous full cribs, but are being drawn upon only to meet the current demand in market suppllos at which they aro a trifle smaller than week ag It is eaid this corn will be marketed more fre ely when farmers get through sending In hogs, but the end of that process Is not yet and In the meanwhile cash demand here and at other points Is about equal to the supply An important feature of the market Is tho faot that wo are about on an export basis and foreigners are taking fair quantities which they have hardly ever done boforo at anything like tneBO prices The circumstance shows that they want our corn and feel they must have it, the experience of many of them last winter for the first time having opened their eyes to Us value as feeding stuff for live stock Of course, there is no roal reason for weakness in our market while this condition condition continues, but the fueling both with regard to corn and oats Is very nervous, being being born of the conviction that prices aro too high for a healthy market, tor which cause many stand ready to soil on the first signs of an Important Increase In the movement from Interior points They are all the more disposed to this as they know farm consumption has been unusually small, both because of tbe mild weather and for the reason that at relative prices It does not pay to put corn into pork In the West This will make the summir supply much more liberal than might be expected expected from the size of the crop Provisions have not settled In price so much as might have been thought, due to tbe excessive run of hogs and big slocks of product Tboy have been sustained by the country buying on the theory that a short corn crop always means dear pork, and packers are the principal principal shorts A fow days ago some longs got tired, but at the resulting decline in the market turned on active cornering, cornering, and It is evident the boars do not fuel ever confident of their ability to send prioes down much further Tbe product Is not so much of a sale as it was a few weeks ago, but we should still recommend caution In buying except on extreme breaks Prom all accounts tbe stock of bogs In the country Is Still a big one, and holders are willing to sell rather than feed high-priced corn, but young stock is being drawn on too freely for the large summer supply " At New York wheat

" As that term Is understood In the United States, I should say it will never come The simple reason is found in the fact that there is no sentiment In favor of Annexation in Canada This opposition to Annexation is found, as intimated before, In tbe loyalty of Canadians to the home government For illustration, tbe eastern province are settled largely by Scotch and English These people people are still ardently attached to the home government In Quebec the Norman French or Roman Catbolio element predominates The great corporation of the Itoman Catholic church has its holding under treaty stipulation If Canada should be annexed to the United States these great claims would be forfeited, or would in laige degree be annulled So you can see that Quebec Is not anxious for Annexation Thus the sentiment goes from province to province The onlyjpeople who really favor Annexation are the young men in some of the bolder town And even these supporters are not very numerous Then again thote whose business dealings bring them in c infect infect with the union are anxious for Annex; lion, or at any rate for reciprocity But you can set this down as an established fiot : That there never was, nor Is, nor perhapi ever will be, a sentiment In favor of Annexation " Annexation ""And in regard to reciprocity I" " Canadians ate bglnnlng to see that thoy csn get along without reciprocity It was all ripbt enough until along came the MoKfnley bill and pltced a heavy duty on many articles whose ratural market was in the United States This was particularly true ot eggs, barley and horses For eggs we have sate found another and an equally god rmrktt, Liverpool We ship Canadian egt aciost the sea and obtain good prices auil a leady sale No doubt, too, we will adju -t things in regard to the other article of export export So you see, we are not In a hurry er in lor leelproclty in Canada " Mrs Chas Smith of J lines, Ohio, writes ; I have used every remedy for siok head film t eeu'd hear of for the past fifteen years, but Carter'!

Take i his metropolis alone In the ten years ending 1869, the inhabitants of London died at an average annual rate of twenty-four for every thousand living : in tbe ten years ending 18S9, that rats was only twenty In other words, over 17,000 lives were being annually saved In that decade in London ; and the mortality is still far too great The saving affected has been largely from the preventable diseases diseases a clans of disease so especially fatal to men and women during the wage-taming wage-taming period of life, a period when death casts upon the surviving public the onerous onerous burden of supporting those whom It was the pride and happiness of the bread winner himself to support Besides which prevention of these diseases means a diminution diminution of preventable sickness, and this carries with it a lessening of domestic misery and an increase of individual vigor and happiness happiness It is no vain Insular b?ast when we say that Gieat Britain stands first among the nations in this matter Tbe palm of preeminence preeminence bas thus far been generally conceded conceded to us, and we wish, if we can," to retain retain it But we are being hardly pressed, and by none more closely than by our, fellows, fellows, the Englith-epeaking nations of bMh hemispheres But in these days of rapid transit the sanitary sanitary condition of any one nation is more than ever a matter of concern to its neighbors neighbors This is especially exemplified in the matter of quarantine It was long the universally recognized custom in the case of epidemics of cholera and nlaznes to nre tend to protect people from tbe Incursion of t-C uieeaee by feIug imaginary lines round the populations In fact, S3 called cordons and quarantines instead of taking steps to provide a complete system of saoi-ttry saoi-ttry administration We in this country have discovered that, If we give our seaports and our country generally an efficient sanitary administration administration and keep our towns clean, It is neoes-iory neoes-iory in the presence of cholera to revert to an empty and antiquated form, which does untold barm by giving a feeling of false security, and which operates mlschlev-lously mlschlev-lously both in health and la commerce Since this attitude was definitely adapted, we have in England and Wales spent near on nine millions sterling per annum upon measures for promoting publio health and In removing the causes of disease Tbe result Is that, while cholera, when imported, imported, has gained no footing among us, hundreds of thousands of valuable lives have been spared, the remunerative capacity and the vigor of the people have bsen Im proved, and the costly item of preveottbie difease and death has undergone a diminution diminution that could hardly have beea anticipated anticipated Sir Douglas Gallon lu the Nlae-tetnth Nlae-tetnth Century Tbe Coining Winter It Is just as well to lay in a supply of coal and stove wood and warm funnels Pro-ft Pro-ft ssor Foster, who Is Iowa's weather prophet, prophet, Fays of tbe coming winter : It will be the coldest and moat stormy, with tbe greatest snowstorms especially deep and drifting snows that has been experienced experienced for many years- Cold weather with blizzards and drifting snows will begin early in October in the elevated region of Colorado and tbe Dakota, and very cold weather, earlier than usual, will cover the states and territories of the Northwest and the Missouri Biver valleys "While tbe very deep snows that will fall and the numerous fierce storms that will occur, travel and transportation will be greatly Impeded "About tbe middle of December tbe weather will become warmer and average so till about tbe 1st of January, 1892, when the cold waves will come again and January and February will average colder than hai been experienced in many years past "In tffect I have made these statements heretofore through tha public press and in my lectures, and my reasons for making these predictions are based on Identically the same causes as were m r predictions that proved to be so accurate for the winter of 1890-91 " Chic ago Tribune Tbe American A bread Senator W

18920708: R train lor Ste Anne's, arriving at 9 41 I proceeded at once to the tasteful and commodious home of the Gold Cure Here I introduced myself to the genial fir Foster, who, on hearing that I came from Montreal, gave me a hearty welcome welcome 1 then proceeded to catechise the medical medical man in reference to certainmuch-discussed questions regarding the famous Gold Cure "Docs the Gold Cure kill anybody?" " No, never," replied Dr Foster, " instances instances have occurred and been made much of by malicious newspapers and jealous, ignorant or prejudiced physicians, physicians, w here patients have died shortly after being discharged, cured, from the Gold Cure institute Now, what do these cases show, when properly investigated? Simply that the patient has been the victim of organic liver, kidney or lung diseaso, the result of long vears of debauchery and expostaVe Take a typical case: Here is a man with far advanced phthisis or tuberculosis, induced induced by lying drunk in the gutter in the j cltii g rain or driving snow, or on an pen doorstep all night beneath the frosty skies o a January blizzard, lie is brought to the Gold Cure, as a lasit res -jit, to t ure his drinking habits lie remains the allotted three or four weeks, and goes home fully and completely cured forever of Ids tasl'e lor alcohol In a month or two he is dead 'The Gold Cure did it' The traducers and the unthinking public take up the cry without investigation or scientific proof The Gold Cure will unfailingly unfailingly curedrunkenness in every shape or torm ; this its opponents don't attempt successfully to deny, so they are compelled compelled to fall back on libellous inventions, false reasoning and wilful perversion of facts What we undertake absolutely to cure is drwkennem, but to replace a pair of varnished lungs or renew a ' hob-nail' liver is not within the scope of the Gold Cure, or in fact of any other cure known to mortal man You mint also remember that many cases seek the Gold Cure w hen far advanced in the throes of delirium tremens If such patients, patients, in isolated instances, soon after coming to our institute, pistol, or throw themselves out of an open window, before the cure has had a fair chance to get in its work on them, can this be reasonably luid at its door ? No; as well blame the oidinary auti-lebrile remedies for the self-destruction self-destruction of a patient delirious through fever We muBt seek for carelessness or ignorance on the part of nurse or guardian, to that, unhesitatingly, I repeat that the Gold ( ure cannot authentically be charged with directly or indirectly causing the pitmuture death of a single one of its thousands and thousands ot patients, but, on the contrarv, has rescued hundreds w ho ere tottering on the very verge of a diui kard's grave " "But doctor, is the cure lasting?" "It is In fact many patients who have been cured for months and years, have assured me that before they took the cure their desire lor alcohol kept growing mora and more intense every day, fight it off us they would, trying to stave off the evil day and make the sober interval between drunks as long as possible, till finally will power was conquered and the much dreaded debauch broke out without restraint restraint Whereas, after experiencing the Cure, the disgust tor, or indifference to, alcohol becomes more deeply rooted as time goes by The very memory of liquor lias faded away Such men are free agents They, like burnt children, drea 1 the tire, and with reason, desire and will all on their side, no longer fear their adversary, adversary, King Alcohol If, however, a person is determined on self-destruction a' rt edu an himself to drink aizain, he t un, oi course, do so, but will find it much Luider than will an individual who has u:erbeforetasted liquor What more in rcnton can be asked?" " How limy daga it take you to euro diunl cnncfcs?" " Three or four weeks We can cure 1 solutely, the worst cases of drunken-rcn drunken-rcn on earth in three to four weeks " Here I asked : " Is it also true that you tieut the opium, morphine aud cocaine habits?" " Yes " "And are they also cured In three or four weeks?" "No, they take four, six and, some very bad cases, eight weeks for an absolute absolute cure We have cases here now, who spent a year in secluded isolation at Guelph with no benefit whatever In fact, such patients, on discharge, as a rule, break out worse than ever, t make up for lost time These cases, with us, are doing well after one week's treat-merit " treat-merit ""How are patients doing who have teen discharged from your Institute?" " Well, they are all occupying good positions, positions, attending to their duties, and feeling hotter than they remember ever being in their lives before They seem to have taken a new lease of life We can ;efcr enquirers to them " " Is it necessary that a patient should be subjected to publicity during treatment treatment V " Not in the slightest Wo are treating patients here privately now, and not even their most Intimate friends are aware oi it You see, people can coiqo here for a summer's outing and take the Gold Cure at theBame time The patient may be treated in his own apartment if he so chooses Ladies aro always treat! privately But 1 may say that once convince convince a man that alcoholism is a disease and he ceases to be falsely ashamed of it, especially when he witnessos the practical practical results of the cure In other patients " It seems rather absurd for a man not to be ashamed of drunkenness, yet afraid to have anyone aware of his taking a cure for the same The doctor then politely show ed me around the building, introducing introducing me to several of the patients, one and all of w hom had but the same story to tell of the beneficial effects of the treatment treatment It was an easy matter to pick out the ones who had been at the institute a fortnight, from the arrivals of only a few days The former presented all the brightness of eye, steadiness of hand and clearness of complexion found in healthy men All, with the exception of the alert and busy doctor, seemed to be enjoyimr one long joyous holiday Fishing ana boating on the river an 1 long walks and drives through the attractive surronn I-ing I-ing country are much indulged in by the patients They are under no restraint w hatever, beyond reporting to the physicians physicians four times a day at convenient hours for treatment On shaking hands with the Doctor, just before leaving for the city, I fired a parting shot : " Is it true that you don't refuse your patients their ordinary supply of whiskey? " "We give them all of the very best liquor they can drink, and as often as they want it They don't want it very long In from two to throe days after commencing treatment they have no more use for it, and that ends the business " business "Wonderful and almost presumptions as seemed to my mind the claims of the doctor, I left Ste Anne's, convinced in my own mind that they are able to bear the test of facts and close inspection If you doubt them, as I did myself at first, go and see in propria persona

follow the general line of the measure of 1886, with some changes, including the retention of Irish members in the Imperial Imperial Parliament, the employment of the police and military to enforce the payment payment of all taxes leviable by the Irish Parliament, restricting the powers of the Irish Legislature to interfere with the endowment of religion, or to a possibility to confer privilege privilege on account of religious belief, and eiving further guarantees regarding denominational denominational education He referred to the adjustment of the pecuniary burdens of Ireland and alluded to a revision of the proposals relating to the arrangements arrangements between the Imperial and Irish exchequers and the proportion of the national debt to be assigned to Ireland In 188(1 this was calculated asoae-fif-tecn for Ireland, based upon estimates estimates of taxation, rateable values, etc This has been found to be a gross over-estimate, entailingover-taxation of the Irish people The financial enquiry long engaged Mr Gladstone's attention, and in it he was assisted by Mr Goschen Enquiry tends to shjw that Ireland can only be justifiably apportioned apportioned about one twenty-eocond part of the debt, making a very great difference in adjusting the pecuniary burdens un lor the new bill niadstone Instance Canada At West Calder Mr Gladstone spoke in a disused quarry for an hour and twenty minutes with unabated vigor After a passing reference to Ireland, he proceeded to cite Tory prophecies made with the view of retarding and defeating the Liberal Liberal proposals The most etl'ective portion portion of the striking and admirably marshaled marshaled list, given with a dramatic force and skill which hugely delightod the audience, was the instance of the Karl of Derby's opposition ia 1837 to the proposal to concede free gov ernment to Canada 11 would be utter ruin, Lord Derby bad said, and would lead to the establishment of a sort of French republic in Lower Canada, and would hand over the Knglish-born minority minority to the tender mercies of the French colonists It was precisely such a speech as might be made by Mr Balfour or Lord Salisbury, although the Karl of Derby was discussing Canada iu a less violent mannor than Lord Salisbury was discussing discussing Ireland Against the Earl of Derby's prophecy Mr Gladstone placed the testimony which Sir Alesand Gait, formerly high commissioner in Great Britain for Cunada, delivered tho other night, to the efl'cct that Canada had flourished exceedingly exceedingly and had become more closely united with the mother country " So," said Mr Gladstone, in an eloquent passage, passage, "would it be with Ireland when she enjoyed the blessings of home rule " Consequences Hast Be Considered Keferring to the desire ot the people of the locality for the imposition of a tax on foreign oils, Mr Gladstone said it would be impossible to consider the practicability of such proposals without considering the consequences to which they would lead the other quarters If articles competing with the products of one district were taxed, they must be prepared to lay corresponding taxes on other foreign produce He contended that the system of free trade had caused an enormous improvement in the condition condition of the working people The Conservatives Conservatives propbesibd that the establishment establishment of Lome rule would lead to trouble in Ireland Mr Gladstone's answer answer to this was that it would lead to prosperity The Conservatives' predictions predictions on the results of every reform, he saidt had been worthless, preposterous fabrications by which the peonle had been deluded and misled John Morlejr's Predicament If Mr John Morley becomes a minister be will have to be re-elocted His opponents opponents in Newcastle mean to nominate Joseph Cowan to oppose him Mr Cowan is immensely popular and the Conservatives Conservatives believe he would be Likely to oust Mr Morley Anticipating a new Cabinet, the parma-nent parma-nent heads of the departments here, as is customary, sought to learn what new ministers they are likely to be required to serve A leading treasury oilicial told the representative of the Associated Press that he had obtained an intimation that Henry Fowler would be chancellor ot the exchequer and Sir William Vornon Harcourt, ilrst lord of the treasury and Government leader in the House of Commons Commons This arrangement contains a startling implication that Mr Gladstone will either retire to the House ot Lords or that he will take the lightest p ist in the Government the presidency of the council Hot the subtest inkling of his intention has as yet reached the chiefs of the departments

the parochial echqoJs tiad experienced and wen trained teac&ers, but no money By combination tbe money of tbe one was set against the experience of tho other The religious teachers consented to remove all emblems emblems of their faith from the schoolhouse and not to refer to religious matters during during school hours The state provided the buildings, and the children of Faribault obtained the advantages of experienced teachers and cultured instructors Archbishop Corrigan; leading the Eastern Eastern Archbishops, bitterly opposed any compromise between Church and State Pope Leo XIII , whose ideas are advanced, advanced, leans somewhat toward the views of Archbishop Ireland, on whom, it is understood, understood, he intends eventually to bestow bestow the scarlet hat of a Cardinal He sent to America at first Mgr O'Connell, once president of the American college at Kome, whose opinions coincide with those of Archbishop Ireland and Cardi-ual Cardi-ual Gibbons, who is opposed to the ultra-Cahenslyism ultra-Cahenslyism of the Archbishop of New York Both the Gibbons-Ireland and the Ol factions have powerful friends at dv xuo ruuu wtw yiuaeu wiui mo r essive loyalty of Archbishop Corrigan bis secretary, Mgr McDonnell, the wealthy Bishopric of Brooklyn, but Leo XIII was too clever a diplomat to estrange estrange the American faction headed by Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland Ireland He knew that the great west, with its almost unlimited territory and its numerous large cities, was pregnant with Catholicism, and should not be discouraged discouraged in the propagation of the faith by any exhibition of even suggestive intolerance intolerance The Pope tolerated the Faribault ex-periment ex-periment of Archbishop Ireland, and heaped lienors upon the western prelate There is no doubt that a cardinal's hat awaits "the consecrated Blizzard" of Minnesota Archbishop Ireland last night refused to express any opinion upon the resolutions resolutions adopted by the American hierarchy hierarchy in conclave But the second resolution resolution speaks for itself It means that where before parents not sending their children to Catholic schools were condemned, condemned, under pain of mortal sin, for doing doing so, they are now "tolerated so long as tbey consent to teach their children Christian doctrine at home after schojl hours, or to send them to the catechism class at the parish church on Sundays " This means that Archbishop Ireland's Faribault experiment should be emulated in other parts of the United States in which the church has a footnold The public school system of the United States, instead of being condemned, is at least tolerated Parents can send their children for secular education wherever they choose Church and State are separated Last night it was said that Mgr Satolh and Mgr O'Connell, who had been sent from Kome by the Holy Fat her to attend this conference and to examine into the school question, were closeted with Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Archbishop Ireland It was also said that all tbe Southern and Western Archbishcps, and even two from the East, sympathized with tbe views expressed 6y Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland at the "Wednesday conclave, and the adherents of Archbishop Corrigan suffered an overwhelming overwhelming defeat With his customary diplomacy the Archbishop of New York has gracefully Lowed to the decision of the majority The questien of tolerance of secret societies is still in doubt The conclave will meet again in Chicago next September, September, just a week after tlie holding of the aiuouc congress 'jr mining Company tent of the province have incorporating Alphonse Bay- tn la visitation ilochelav'ii ;

That's what beats me " And Miss Geraldine van llooten an-sewered, an-sewered, "Dollars " founding her theory on the fact that Miss Hamilton's father was occupying the best "stateroom" in the ship alone, and that he had not yet condescended to appear on deck and mix with bis fellow travellers " Or perhaps he's noble," she said speculatively And Miss van Hooten endorsed her friends' opinion that Mr Fletcher was "elegant " As they had applied the term indiscriminately indiscriminately to the big rollers the Arcadia had encountered out Queonstown harbor to the furniture of the saloon, and to a shoal of porpoises, thore was nothing; startling in their applying to a tall singular young man, with a determined jaw and a black mustache dividing his face witti a line as straight as a ruler over w hat seemed to be a rather thin pair of lips An elegant man in the ordinary plain British acceptation of the term he certainly was not, whatever Miss Lolie Luck may have said and Miss Hamilton , may have thought, and Miss Hamilton's eyes showed that she thought well of him - " "She's mean to keep him to herself like that," said Miss Luck one afternoon ; "she looks at him when he comes on deck till he turns and she catches his eye and if he does not come and plant himself down by her right away, she'll look at him till he does, and when no sits down she has nothing to say " There may have been some truth in Miss Luck's remarks She had a quick eye, and possibly Mr Fletcher was himself himself feeling that he was himself extracting extracting much amusement from Miss Hamil ton's conversation He was leaning back in his chair looking at her from under his half-closed eyelids "So your father is going to leave the old country and settle in America?" he said slowly : "not leaving bis country for his country's good, I hope ?" he added with a half laugh It was the fourth time that afternoon that he had mentioned her father's name three times she had turned the conversation conversation to other subjects, and now she was looking seaward, silent and with her cheeks crimsori He must have been a quickwitted man though, to notice the effect of his speech and jump to the conclusion conclusion which he did " Forgive me," he said, bending forward forward and speaking earnestly, " forgive me, Miss Hamilton, if I have Baid anything anything to hurt you ; you know me very slightly, but well enough, I hope, to kdow 1 would not have done so willingly " "Many a true word is spoken in ajest," she said, half to herself, moving as if she would rise from her chair ; but he touched touched her arm and she sat down again " I must have your forgiveness for what I said," he insisted, "you kuow 1 would not betray any confidence, why should I ? Who am I that I should do eo? I would do anything rather than otfend you what can I say ? Stay you see that man ?" He was pointing to a fair little red-faced red-faced man who was diligently trying to obtain an appetite for dinner by pacing the deck Miss Hamilton nodded She had turned turned pale from red, and the lonely, frightened frightened look had come back to her eyes She looked at the little man indifferently " He said he was at school with you, and he called you by some other name when he came up and spoke to you," she said Mr Fletcher was looking at the little man with an expression that was not exactly exactly benevolent "lie called me by a name that was not Fletcher, Misi Hamilton, and I'm not quite sure that he was not right ; so you see that I have a claim on your indulgence, indulgence, almost on your confidence " Hut whatever Mr Fletcher may have expected Miss Hamilton to say, she said nothing then The afternoon had grown colder and the horizon was full of damp mist She pulled her cloak tightly around her with one hand, and with the Angered restlessly the arm of the chair on which che sat Mr Flotchor looked Annoyed : he moved Lis chair a little closer to hers and glanced rather nervously nervously at the small, well-gloved hand as it rested for a moment on the chair arm nearest to liim He had never boon at a loss for words before in her society, he must have been conscious that ho ha 1 done most of the talking during theli1 an quulutiince, that on trivial topics he ha I found allow of conversation whloh ha I amused her, and that whon he hai touched more serious Biibjocbi he hal secured her interest, or even draw her into argument, and yet he sat silent fjr ten whole minutes looking at hor Miss 1 crania Luck grew impatient ; she could Bee them from where she sat and she let her book drop on her knoua to watch " 1 believe they've quarreled," she said to herself, and then more loudly, " Mr Smith " The fat little man who was pounding the deck for the good of his health paused end bowed " I shall bo much obliged If you will allow me to join you In your conrtitu-tional," conrtitu-tional," said Miss Luck, and as she took his arm and paced the deck with him she confided to him with characteristic can lor that she sullbred from dyspepsia "Too much Iced water," said Mr Smith sympathetically And having found a topic interesting to both of them hey fell to discussing the comparative merits of a British and an American dietary " Keep this side of the dock," said Miss Luck; ''there's a perfect blizzard the other side of the smokoBtaok " In the warm shelter to bo found in the neighborhood of the tunnel Miss Luck lii gored ; in the more exposed portions of the deck sho raced Mr Smith along till he was almost out of breath "Mice comfortable place your friend '8 cely lives' has choson,''she said to the Co npimion who was trotting to keep up wl h one of her fastest spurls JHit Mr Smith did not know whom she meant " Mr Fletcher," sheexplnined; " he has been sitting there all tho afternoon with M sh llmnilti n " Hut Mr Smith denied all acquaintance with Mr Flotchor "But I've seen you speaking to him twice," said Miss Luck : "twice since we came on board ; once when you spoke to him on deck and held out your hand and lie turned his back on you, and once alter that, lte one night when you were talking tun ether like old friends in tho smoke-room smoke-room 1 looked in as 1 walked by tho door," " Your bright eyes see everything, Miss Luck " protested Mr Smith " There are no flies on Lolie," said Miss Luck, gracefully acknowledging the compliment; compliment; but refusing to bo put oil' by it, sue added, impatiently, wuo is Mr Fletcher, anyway?" "I don't know" said Mr Smith, and added, " I am afraid you ;ire catching cola " But it was incredulity, not catarrh which caused Miss Luck to sniff, and she made r o further rejoinder The fog had thickened, the stoas: foghorn foghorn was beginning to boom over their heads with the groan of a distracted mammoth, but Miss Luck, holding Mr Smith's arm, continued to tramp the deck She was rewarded in time for hor patience, if Mr Smith had the right to judge from the tightening grip of her fingers and the tbrill of excitement in her tone as she whispered ; " Look as we go by this time ; he is holding her hand " Mr Smith was a bashful man and a discreet one To his honor be it said, he did not look He tried, on the contrary, to restrain his companion from going near them where they sat " They will not mind us," said Miss Luck in a tone of conviction And she w as right to the extent that it was not ber presence which caused Mr Fletcher to straighten himself in his chair, while a slight cloud of impatience crossed his face A tall, elderly man, wrapped in a thick ulster with the collar turned up round Lis throat, had come and stood behind behind them and said in a tentative voice, as if not quite sure of her identity, " Edith," and then in an imperious, impatient impatient tone as she turned her head, " Edith, I iiave been looking for you everywhere " "Yes, father," said Miss Hamilton, quietly She had naturally a quiet, low-pitched low-pitched voice; when she spoke to her lather it seemed almost suppressed She said a few words to him as Mr Eletcher rose and stood by with his self-possessed self-possessed angular air and a slight lo jk of expectancy " My goodness !

next Monday elicited prolonged Liboral cheers The mover and seconder sp jue to empty benches The House tilled like magic, however, when Mr Arthur J Balfour, first lord ot the t'oasury in the last (Salisbury Cabinet, and now leader of tlie Unionist Opposition, arose somewhat languidly and amid a storm of Opposition cheers began a general criticism of the Govern ment He congratulated the Cabinet Cabinet upon the abandonment of He policy to abandon Uganda, In their Egyptian policy Mr Balfour said the ministers could rely upon the support support of tho Opposition as long as thoy upheld upheld British right, lie trusted tho Government would at their earliest convenience convenience let Parliament know the cause which led to tho recent troubles in Cairo Among tlie causes, undoubtedly, were the rash utterances made by the Prime Minister and the Chief Secretary for Ireland Ireland w hen they were in the Opposition Both were to blame for rising hopea w hich would certainly be productive of future difficulties He demanded that the Home Secretary should say whether or not the release of Fgan and Callan, the Irish dynamiters, was a part of a policy of amnesty intended intended to involve the release of all the Irish, dynamiters, and he charged Mr Morfey, Irish secretary, with having used the Crow n prerogative for political purposes Mr OIndNtone' Itcply Mr Gladstone was ebeered loudly wbon he rose to answer Mr Balfour, lie had noticed, he said, that with the continued growth oflegialative arrears the eagerness eagerness of the country , for vigorous legislation legislation Increasod He bad decided to lose no timo, therefore, in satisfying this eagerness He would secure the appointment appointment of a Hoyal commission to enquiro into the Weslh land question, llo reproached reproached Mr Balfour for asaailing with iniiamniatory criticism a bill not yet introduced, and for doing his utmost lo prejudice the minds of big followers followers against a plan of home rule of which be was still ignorant llo would not reply to Mr Balfour'g invectives against Mr Morloy'a administration administration of Ireland except to say that the wise policy of clemency had been simultaneous simultaneous with a great decrease of agrarian crime The mission to Uganda was necessary in order that an impartial aud thorough enquiry be made into altair there The result of this enquiry would enable the Government to arrive at a rational decision He did not believe (list in his long Parliamentary career he hud ever uttered words so rash and dang erous as w ere those uttered by Mr, Balfour concerning the difficulties in Fgypt 1 nese words tinu seemod to auggest that the Government would lose no time in getting out of Egypt Mr Balfour rose and repudiated the charge t'ott he had suggested the probability of a has'v evacuation Upon resuming Mr Glad stone said that the Government had not to consider the question of occupation, but merely tlie maintenance o( order Tho relations of the two governments had now beon placed on a satisfactory footing, and further further trouble was not apprehended In conclusion Mr Gladstone repe tej his appeal to tlie House not to be moved by premature denunciations of the Home Kule bill He could undoistand tho impatience impatience of members if thoy discovorod any disposition to delay tho bill, but this did not exist It surely would be hotter for all to wait and give the provisions of the bill their full careful deliberation, perhaps calm, Impartial, evon benevolent, Judgment Alter Mr Gladstone's Jtpoocli (lie House

the meantime to question tho foreign policy of the Government So far as Known In the absence of official papers, the policy of the new ministry seemed to 1 founded on sound principles and to be executed with judgment and skill Events in Egypt rendered the difficulties surrounding the British occupation more numerous The Government must postpone postpone the withdrawal of British troops, f iiit this in no wise modified the assurances that had been given to foreign powers concerning E'ypt Touching upon the question of home itilo for Irelund, 1ird Salisbury said that the 0110 object of the Government during tlie past six months had been to got the Hiipjmrt of a class of men whom hitherto no politicians in England had tried to conciliate The keynote of the Irish policy tf the Government was to get the support of the criminal classes The pro-viwons pro-viwons noccHsary to maintain the law bad been repealed Though, agrarian crime was not prevalent generally, yet in districts where it did prevail the hands of the law were paralyzed (Conservative (Conservative cheers ) The prerogative of the Crown had beon used to shield murderers murderers and release dynamiters All the acta of the Government caused the impression impression that they were much more in sympathy with criminals than desirous oj' vindicating the law, (Crios of " Hear, hear ") U lie reierence in the Queen's speech to home rule was the most peculiar peculiar sentence he had ever seen in a public document It seemed to indicate that the Government opinion of the whole Irish question with which Parliament had to deal, was that it was for one portion portion of the Irish to place thoir heel upon the neck of the Protestant population of Ireland With repaid to tlie other measures measures indicated in the Queen's speech, Lord Sulishury declared that nobody believe ! believe ! that they would ever be undertaken Thoy were simply a repetition repetition of the programme adopted by the Liberal conference at Newcastle Lord Salisbury alluded to the agricultural agricultural depressions He said that agriculture suflered most from want of confidence Political partisans now preached doctrines doctrines that were filling the minds of the owners of capital with apprehension There was no country in the world, Lord Salisbury added, where property was now so insecure as in Great Britain in consequence , ot erroneous legislative action (Cries of " Hear hear ") The Earl of Kimberloy, lord president of tlte council and secretary of state for India, replied to Lord Salisbury He mildly remonstrated with Lord Salts-bury Salts-bury for accusing the Government of having By mpatby w ith Irish criminals Mr, Gladstone 1 Irritated, In his speech this evening Mr Gladstone Gladstone showed plainly that he had been irritated by Mr Balfour's taunts The tones of his voice indicated deep indignation indignation and his gestures were rapid and violent, especially when he repudiated the imputation that royal clemency had been exploiled'for political purposes in tbe cases of the Irish dynamiters ani the G weedore prisoners W hen he came to the discussion of Uganda and Egypt his energy was partially exhausted, his voice was husky and he was obliged to relapse into a conversational tone He spoke for forty-eight minutes with good ell'ect The curious distribution of seats resulted in some confusion, especially during the lost three or four speeches, which were interrupted repeatedly repeatedly with cheers, laughter and expressions expressions of dissent from unexpected quarters Nearly 400 notices of bills and motions were given during the Bitting This is the largest number recorded at any one sitting of Parliament Lord Kandolph Churchill, in conversation with

18930508: SUNNY MANITOBA It is always of importance to have honest estimates of what we prir o, especially especially when the authors of thorn have some right to consider themselves ex-pertsinthe ex-pertsinthe matters as to which they pronounce judgment Since the opening up of tho Northwest we have had a eon-sideroble eon-sideroble variety of opinion touching the value of the prairie country as a home for Immigrants Tho latest of these expres-sions expres-sions of opinion conies to us in the form of a volume for which tho writer claims attention as the outcome of porsonal observation, observation, unbiased by the interests of governments, companlos or Individuals He avoids indiscriminate eulogy on tho one hand, and unjust depreciation on tho other, and his recommendation of " Sunny Manitoba" as a land of promiso for a large class of his English com- patriots haB a note of sinoority which sometimes rises to the pitch of enthusiastic enthusiastic faith Mr Alfred 0 Loggo, tho writer in question, has given hostages, sospoak, to the good fortune of the land that ho praises, for his sons, to whom he dedicates dedicates his book, have for years been denizens denizens of that land For those who have read the statistical bluo books of the Government and tho many pamphlets of l'rof Tanner, Fream, Gilbert and othor experts, as well as the tostimony of l'rof Macoun, Saunders, liryce, and others who are intimately acquainted with the resources of the province, Mr Legjje's book will possess little novelty One-half of it Is mainly made up of gleanings from previous publications and the remainder, while giving the writer's personal experience and opinions of the country, its products and its people, goo over ground which has boon largely covered covered by works already in print The value of the book consists, however, in the fact that even when he avails hira-Belfof hira-Belfof the data and conclusions of preceding preceding writers, Mr Legge adds information information and reflections ol his own which confirm confirm what he deems justifiable and reject reject or refute what he considers unwarranted unwarranted in the statements His object is to correct certain mistaken impressions which spitefully or carolosaly false accounts of the Northern prairie have made in the minds of many Kng-lishmen Kng-lishmen Some of those false accounts originated with emigration agents from the other side of the border, others from croakers among the settlers who, chiefly through lack of industry, judgment, patience and other essential qualities, had failed to achieve a reasonable success, success, and others again from the wilfui misrepresentations of politicians eager to aim a telling blow at their opponents, but unscrupulous in their choice of weapons The best answer to the calumnies of all these interested detractors is to tell the true story of a typical settler, the owner of Riverside farm, a homestead homestead in which the author spent many a happy day Of this farm possession was taken in the fall of 1882 and we are initiated initiated into the secrets of its development development during the ten years that ensued To the English farmer or citizen desirous of making himself an independent home in the new world this record of progress must be of extreme practical interest Mr Legge describes the prairie, its natural natural means of irrigation, its flora, its fanna, its climate, the fertility of the soil, the risks of early frost and how they may be best guarded against, the mixed farming farming that is most likely to succeed, the society of the prairie land, the provisions for education, for religious ministration, for social intercourse and relaxation, and for intellectual culture Among the unfounded notions that have come, in the minds of some old country people, to be associated with Manitoba and the Northwest, one is a belief tbat the blizzard has its jEolian cave north of the boundary line This Mr Legge pronounces a popular delusion, which leaves those of hisfellow-countrymen who read his book no execuse for continuing to cherish Compared with : Dakota and the other states to the South, Manitoba has the advantages both in climate and fertility, and those Canadians Canadians who hearkened to the interested wants of federal or state agents had sad reason to deplore their rashness Apart from acknowledged diversities of climate, greatly in Canada's favor, statistics quoted by Mr Legge show that the yield of wheat w hich In Dakota averages 9, in Minnesota 12, and in Wisconsin 12J buBhels to the acre, has in Manitoba an average of 24 0 buahels From these figures figures English farmers can draw thoir own conclusions Other cereals, as well as most vegetables and many of the fruits of temperate latitudes, yield in like proportion proportion Of wild berries there Is an amazing growth, and the prairie is bright with w ild flowers Trees, once scarce In parte, are by judicious planting and experiments experiments made with butternut, black walnut, soft maple, cottonwood, hard maple, w hite elm, white and green ash, and other trees, though the results varied in different localities, have on the whole been encouraging Mr Legge considers the birch, queen of ornamental trees, by no means difficult of propagation in the province, and wonders at its absence from the selection made by the Central Farm authorities The high value of trees to the farmer is beyond question and perseverance in experimental experimental forestry is of the utmost importance importance to the future of Manitoba and the region beyond Mr Legge disagrees with those who condemn beet culture for sugar making in the Prairie province, and insists that it would be profitable to both growers and manufacturers He devotes a good deal of attention to the industries, both actual and posslblo, of Sunny Manitoba Manitoba He points out its many and manifold manifold attractions for the sportsman aud lover of out door life, and expresses his conviction tbat it is the healthiest country in the world Social life, with acknowledged acknowledged drawbacks, such as the proneness to intemperance among some lit the young men and the i;nor-alice i;nor-alice of others, has very real pleasure? Englishman-like, Mr Lege piofers his compatriots to those who have had the honor to be born In Canada Canada He evidently was just long enough in the NorthweBt to lose his way In the labyrinth of our Dominion and provincial politics, and some of his judgments are curious He Is evidently a Liberal when J e is at home, and, of oourso, he is a free trader, like the average Englishman everywhere But he admires Canadian loyalty and its great spokesman and champion, the late Sir John Macdonald Mr Legge classes his book (which Is published published by Mr

18940214: M certainly has no equal In 1880 he drove the Beaconsfield Government from power simply by arousing public feeling on a matter of very little concern to the British electorate the so-called Bulgarian Bulgarian atrocities Since then he has performed performed the miracle for it is little less than that of gaining a majority in the United Kingdom in favor of home rule If he undertakes a campaign against the Lords he will have everything in his favor The abolition of thtrPeera has long been an item in the Radical programme, programme, and almost every member of the present administration, except Mr Gladstone himself and those of his colleagues colleagues who are in the Upper House, has taken occasion to throw a stone at the Peers during the last few weeks The Liberal press has been busily engaged in denouncing the Lords with all the vigor at its command It only needs the fire of Mr Gladstone's eloquence to sot the whole party aflame against the Lords, and if there is not a great ourburst of popular indignation there will be an agitation agitation dangerous enough to make the Lords hesitate before such an encounter If the struggle which the Liberals are threatening goes on, what are the forces the Peers can bring to meet their assailants assailants ? The Marquis of Salisbury is an able administrator and a clever speaker, but as a leader of the Democracy he is not worth a cent, and it is largely througl his imprudence that this struggle has been provoked His nephew, Mr Bal four, is also a good speaker, and more popular than his uncle, but he is not w eight for Mr Gladstone The best man the Unionists have for the work is Mr Chamberlain, and he was the Jurat, and as yet the only, man to take up Sir William William Uarcourt's challenge His defence of the Lords was that the Peers had correctly correctly interpreted the feeling of the vast majority of the British electorate This is undoubtedly the best card for the Unionists to play, but Mr Chamberlain is hardly the man to play it There was a time when Mr Chamberlain was a Radical, and no one said bitterer things about hereditary legislators than he did Ten years ago, when th Peers rejected the bill enfranchising the country laborers, laborers, Mr Chamberlain spoke words which seem to the Radicals admirably suited to the present situation : Are the Lords to dictate to ub, the people of England? Are the Lords to dictate to us the laws which we shall make aud I lie way la which we Khali bring them In ? Are you going to be governed by yourBelren, or will you sub- mlt to an oligarchy which is the mere oool-dent oool-dent of birth ? It Is inconceivable that you idiould be so careless of your Igreat herlUso ax to submit your liberties to this miserable minority minority of individuals who rent their claims upon privilege and upon accident f The history history of'tho House of Lords has boen one long contest between the representatives of privilege privilege and the representatives of popular rights, and during this time the Lords have perverLed, delayed and denied Justice uutilat last they gave grudgingly and churlishly what they could no longer withhold I resent tbe insults, the injuries and tbe Injustice from which you have suffered so long at the bands of a privileged assembly assembly But the cup U nearly full The career of high handed wrong Is coming to an end We have been too long aPeerrldlen nation, and 1 hope you will say to them that If they will not bow to the mandate of the people thay shall lose for ever the authority they hve so long abused The man who spoke these words cannot cannot pose as the champion of the Peers with any hope of success Mr Chamberlain Chamberlain may be justified in his contention that the Lords are right now, though they may never have been right before, but bis own words condemn him The issue will not be restricted to the conduct of the Lords in the present crisis Their long course of opposition to popular reforms reforms will be brought in evidence against them What their record is the words of Mr Chamberlain quoted above sufficiently sufficiently indicate All the great reforms of the last fifty years have been opposed by the Lords, and though they have passed them under pretssure from tbe electorate, tiny Lave not caused to disapprove ot them The House is thoroughly oat ot fymjathy with the democracy of to-day, and acts merely as a drag upon the legislative legislative coach It has been tolerated be cause Englishmen are not given to sentimental sentimental grievances, and will put up with anomalies so long as they cause no serious serious inconvenience As an institution the House of Lords cannot be logically defended in a modern democracy It has been allowed to remain part of the British constitution because it gave little trouble and was willing to give way under the pressure of public opinion It has saved itself this way before, and, no doubt, will be able to escape by the back door in this instance But these struggles are dangerous, and every one of them, to use a pet phrase of the Radicals, " drives another nail into the Lords' coffin " The less public attention attention is drawn to the House of Lords, the longer it is likely to be left alone That is why it seems unwise on the part of Lord Salisbury to have involved the Peers in the present struggle Circumstances Circumstances justified them in rejecting the Home Rule bill, but to override the decision decision of the elected representatives of the people on matters so directly the concern of the democracy as localself-government and employers' liability was to arrogate arrogate to themselves a position which cannot cannot be defended If Mr Gladstone, by an appeal to the electorate, carries the Home Rule bill and other democratic measures, and at the same time deals a serious blow at the prestige of the House of Lords, the Peers will only have themselves themselves to thank A question was recently asked by a correspondent of the Timet which gives a curious glimpse into some features of the English meat market It was stated in that paper that 1,373,723 carcasses of frozen sheep had come last year from the River Plate alone, in addition to 2,514,541 from Australia and New Zealand Zealand Mr Beddington, a farmer, want to know what becomes of this importation importation He knows London well, but cannot recall a single firm having offered to sell River Plate mutton, mutton, although ostensibly many firms deal in the New Zealand article After some computation he reaches a conclusion conclusion which he deems not Improbable that the River Plate mutton is mainly sold as New Zealand, while the latter is sold as English mutton He suggests compulsory branding of all foreign meat, though such a plan may lessen the butchers' profits and retard the rapid march to ruin of the English farmor It appears that a fortnight ago New Zea land sent by the steamer Kuapehu 11, 855 cases of butter and 1,2-3 cases of cheese to England the largest dairy cargo yet from that province India has been permeated of late with a far reaching sentiment in favor of social reform This sentiment has displayed itself itself in various practical movements, In one province the reduction of extrava gant outlays on marriage ceremonies being the aim ; in another the enfranchisement enfranchisement ot the Hindoo widow, the abolition abolition ot the system of inheritance through sisters in a third, and in a fourth, an urgent call on fathers of families to educate their female children Another movement strikes a blow at improvident early marriages, the very same evil about the prevalence of which in the States Dr Cyrus EdBon has been writing in tbe North American Keiiew One Montreal wholosale house reports that as a result of the enlargement of the dairy induhtry there has been a marked improvement in the dry goods business in many sections of the province In one group of lour parishes an average of SG5 O0O a piece was distributed through the creamorios and cheese factoriej!

18940227: NATIONAL DRINK BILLS Dr Dawson Burns, a temperance statistician statistician well known in Great Britain, has got out the "drink bill" of the Unite! Kingdom for 1803 In that year the British public consumed 1,137,3!M5,00 gallons of beer, 37,727,823 gallons of spirits, and 14,104,771 gallons of wine, in addition to a quantity of British wines estimated at fifteen million gallons, the total expenditure amounting to JE138 854, 829 or nearly seven hundred million dollars More beer was drunk in 1893 than inl8'J2 butspirits and wines show a considerable falling off; the net decrease in expenditure in intoxicants amounted to about ten million dollars, a drop of 1J per cent, on the drink bill of 1892 On an average, every person in the United Kingdom spent 3 12s 3d in intoxicants during the year as against 3 13s lid in 1892, and 3 15s in 1891 A similar decrease decrease has taken place in Canada during the last few years, and for the last twenty years our expenditure in intoxicants intoxicants has only been about one-third per head of the amount spent in the old country In 1892 Canadians spent on an average about $5 each as against $17 34 in the United Kingdom An equally striking difference is to be note! in the amount of liquor consumed consumed The Inhabitants of England drank nearly a barrel of beer (36 gallons) per head during the past year ; Scotland, 13 gallons ; Ireland, 10 gallons ; Canada, less than 3J gallons In spirit drinking the Scotchman stands far away at the head of the list, his proportion being 1 67 gallons, gallons, as against 1 04 for the Irishman, 0 88 for the Englishman and 0 74 for the Canadian In wine the Canadian also shows up the best from the temperance point of view, the average consumption being 0 85 in England, 0 50 in Ireland, 0 49 in Scotland and 0 09 in Canada Altogether Altogether England spent In intoxicants during the year $18 09 per head, Scotland $14 5, Ireland $10 26 and Canada about $5, prices being reckoned on the same basis as in the English returns Whichever way we look at the figures, it is evident that Canada drinks less and spends less on drink than any portion of the old country Temperance feeling is stronger here, and keeps drinking drinking customs in check to a greater extent The amount of beer the average Englishman Englishman drinks in a year is something enormous enormous The returns give 35 gallons per head, but it must be remembered that in anlvlrig at this average women, children, and teetotalers are all counted Half the population of England must drink no beer, or next to none ; and that means that the other half consume 70 gallons of beer per heed in a year more than a pint and a half for every day in the year The explanation is to be found in the old-established English custom of drinking beer to diuoer and supper, which does not prevail in Canada to anything like the same extent When a Canadian wants a drink he generally gets it in a ealoon ; while in the old country country there are men who drink gallons in the course of a year, but would be ashamed to be seen in a public house Beligious feeling is also very much more in favor ol temperance in Canada than it is in Great Britain Here nearly all cler gymen are abstainers Among the clergy of the Church of England in the old country there are very few teetotallers, and among the Noncorrloi mists the proportion proportion is probably not as high as it is in Canada The religious sentiment with regard to intoxicants has its influence upon society, and wine probably plays a lens important part in social functions than at home In all these points the old country is following in our footsteps, tut at ti e present rate of progress it will he a very long time befoie Great Britain reaches the position with regard to temperance temperance that Canada occupies to-day The idea that one Britisher is good enough for GOO niggers is bound to receive a set back now and then, when the tribes dealt with are bold and crafty, and armed with modern weapons That is probably the explanation of the defeat of a small British force in Gambia, which apparently apparently trusted more to the luck of the British army than to efficient arrangements arrangements for its own protection The Chief Fodisilah, who has had the glory of the victory, will probably come to repent repent his triumph In dealing with a power like that of the British Crown, it is cheaper for savage races to take a beating quietly in the first instance An African chief can hardly be expected to refrain from wiping out a few British troops when he has the chance, especially especially if they intorfere with his capture and t ale of niggers, but a high price has to be paid tor these little diversions afterwards A much more powerful expedition Is going on the track of the former, just to straighten things up a bit, and Chief Fodisilah will probably end likeCete-wayo likeCete-wayo or Lobengula The English advisers of the Khedive are going on steadily with the reform of Egyptian administration, and already considerable progress has been made Instead Instead of judges gaining their seats by bribery and favoritism, and administering administering justice on the same lines, only competent competent men are appointed, and if they do not keep straight they are sent about their business The courts of summary jurisdiction, which have been established established both for civil and criminal cases, have brought justice within the reach of the poor, and the improvement of the system system has been manifested both in the increase increase of the relative proportion of convictions convictions and the decrease of actual crime, especially of highway robbery Whatever Whatever the Khedive may think of the British British adruiniKtralion, his subjects will be sorry to lose the boons of security of life and property, and even-handed justice for rich and poor alike Paiis has suffered from some dangerous dangerous crazes, but none so decidedly uncomfortable uncomfortable for respectable citizens as the Anarchist fever, which has apparently Eeized on a section of the populace There is not a more dangerous section of society anywhere than the rabble of the French capital They have just intelligence enough to take up crazy ideas, and their brains seem to be set on fire in cn in stant An Anarchist epidemic will be even more difficult to be dealt with than the destructive revolutionary outbreaks which have again and again threatened to lay waBte one of the most beautiful cities of the world The official returns of the prohibition plebiscite in Prince Edward Island show 10,585 votes for to 3,331 against The total parliamentary vote in Prince Ed ward island at the last parliamentary election was 24,057 The vote cast was about 18,500 The plebiscite only brought out about 14,000 Barely 44 per cent of the total declared for prohibition, and though this no doubt, represents at least one-hall of the available vote, it does not promise that provincial prohibition would be more effective on the island than was the Scott act A Dr Samuel Green has discovered that the word blizzard, generally sap posed to have originated in Dakota, dates back to the seventeenth century As this was long before Dakota had a name, it follows that the originator of tho word mutt have had Dakota in his prophetic eye Else he could not have so well de signed a name to fit Dakota's peculiar climatic product In his valedictory address yesterday Hon Mr Desjardins referred to a former occupant of the mayor's chair who claimed credit to himself for all the good legislation of the council, and laid the blame for all that was bad on the alder men Perhaps Ex-Mayor McShane could recall the name of the gentleman in question Last night saw Patti farewell per formance in Montreal That, at any rate, is what the advertisements said ; but Path has a way of her own of disregard' ing her advertisements, that encourages the hope that she may give us many mote farewells, and get paid for them If Mr Wiman is wise he will stop giving out explanations of his case The effect of those he has so far delivered is to make people who read them wonder why, amid so many words, he doe3 not deny the accusations against him, The cheering news comes from Quebec that no Ice bridge has formed at Cape Rouge this winter This gives promise of an early opening of navigation, and will make all good Montrealers rejoice The signs of spring are showing them reives just now, chiefly in the wholesale millinery shops And they are gorgeous, BIRTH Qi'inn At Pie Annede Rellevuo on Satnr-dny Satnr-dny 24 th February, 1884, the wlfeof M

18940330: A HAPPY HOME A Sucoeiwful Hcl tier's ft tory Abont the Canadian Northwent To the Editor ot tlie Gazette : bin, 1 came to the Northwest in the autumn of 1883 My objeclvas to see whether a man in my position, with impaired impaired health, limited means, and a large family, could likely live and rear a family family in a fairly respectable way I was favorably impressed with the beauty and fertility ot many places I examined, from Southern Manitoba to the Sturgeon river, north of Edmonton, but Red Deer, for several reasons, suited me best then, and suits ntn still This is, to a great ax tent, purely a matter of fancy In so vast a country, with such varied and abundant resources and possibilities, it is quite impossible for any one locality to monopolize ail the good things; all those who make such a claim may well be suspected suspected of sinister motives I returned in April, 18S4, with a wife and ten children, a man and maid servant servant and nurse girl, and am living on the Bpot where 1 first droye down my tent pins At that time there was no railway north of Calgary Our household effects, farm implements and Bupplies had to be carted in by half-breed freighters at 1J cents per pound ; and our cattle were driven the 100 miles from Calgary in such daily stages as they could stand, grazing by the way, the young men with a team, tent and supplies campiug wher ever night overtook them Then there were no people in the country with the exception oi some half-dozen whites and a few half-breed families What is now known as the Red Deer district, reach ing from south of Innisfail to north of Lacombe, was an uninhabited desert Theie was not one Post office between Calgary and Edmonton, 200 miles;

and having pictures in our minds and music in ourselves, ourselves, we learned that happiness is not a matter of grand houses or luxurious furniture ; but love and confidence, and a common and high purpose to succeed in spite of all obstacles We had faith in God, and a whole lot of faith in ourselves ourselves We went to work with a will, getting up in the morning, contrary to the habit of many in these days, and staying with it all day We had no post ofbee to drive to, taking a day each week, and no hotel with its bar and billiards to take another day, and few persons with whom to discuss politics, weather and crop prospects ; so that the terrible tax of fifty per cent, upon our productive energy, a tax that would drive a man into anarchy it done by any but himself, was all saved up and devoted to the very commonplace but important task of getting getting bread, and we made a living and kept up out of the mud We had much to encourage our industry industry The soil was rich and productive, productive, the climate, in my judgment, the best in Canada That does not say that we have not at times severely cold weather Nor does it say that we can prow all the vegetables, or many of the iiuits that can be grown successfully ic some other parts of Canada But the atmosphere is dry, the winters are short, many of them very mild, so that cattle and horses are absolutely independent of the stall, except, of course, working teams or milch cows Hay, however, is abundant, so that In more severe winters, or a cold Bran, or storm in mild winters, feed is abundant, and no loss need ever emir The springs are early as a rule There is a vast preponderance of bright weather The autumns are long and de-Jilhtlul de-Jilhtlul The rainfall Is tinder the average for Canada, but for the ten years we have been here we have ha I no approach to a killing drought There are few severe storms, no blizzards, nor hot winds 'taken all round, it is a delig'tful, healthy climate We have rich and abundant pasturage, pasturage, pure water, good supply of wor d, an inexhaustible supply of coal These are some of the natural advan tages which seduced us in the early days, and our love to the country has not decreased decreased with the years As civilization has come to us in the forms of post oflice school, church, society, railway, law and order, open accessible markets, tbe best an-rouna prices lor iarm produce anywhere that I hear or read of why should I think less of this great inher itance which God has given loyal Canadians, Canadians, and the people of all the earth who are willing to become loyal Can adians pan oi tne greatest empire on earth ?

to Congress from the President Prior to this announcement announcement the market had been very heavy as the Administration bill had Biilitred a very heavy defeat yesterday in ti e llouce v At first traders were somewhat bewildered as a number of tumors were in circulation, but the facts In the car e are that the President sells $62,317,600 of thirty yetr 4 per cent, bonds, for which the Treasury is to get three and a half million ounces of gold which will bring the reserve in the Treasury Treasury up to a little above the $100,000,000 mark The syndicate formed will get half of this gold from Europe while the other half will be supplied from this side The rate at which the bonds were sold to the syndicate, 5'i per rent , was a surprise, it being a higher price than had been anticipated and the general list broke quite badly, doting w ith but a small rally Some of the foregoing details may not be correct in every particular, but the facts are that Mr Cleveland has shown his determination determination to take care of the Treasury's finances finances The news, however, that the Government are compelled to sell bonds on a 3 per cent, basis is nothing to boast about In iormer years it has been the proud boaetof this country that its credit was ahead of all other countries, judging lromtbe price of its bonds This has now all been changed, and when the people people realize the situation they will very readily see the cause of this, which is that our legislators have been content to play cheap politics rather than take care of the country's needs, and that the country at large has been made to stifTor ; the syndicate price namely 3iJ per cent, will open the eyes of the taxpayers to this fact and it will in our opinion lead to a better realization of the situation and a avert another and severer object lesson We think the market will be lower as the money market market will harden from this on, and the bank statement will show about $:5,000,-(iCO $:5,000,-(iCO decrease, and when the money for the bond issue will have been paid into the Treasury the reserve will show another another large shrinkage The money market market has been so easy for vears that a tightening of rates will no doubt influence prices Regarding earnings, same may be temporarily interfered with by the blizzard in the West, and we expect "the tit Paul earnings for the second week to show a big decrease, still people must not forget that this is not the time to be bearish as conditions in the mercantile word are not on the mend '' MacDongall Bros , stock brokers, 69 St Francois

al-My Friend From India Returning: There was a good audience at the Queen's Theatre last night, and It may justly be said that no one went away disappointed; everybody everybody enjojed "Dodge at the Frenoh Ball " It is one of those pieces that is vim and go all the way through; it is a musical comedy of a type that is calculated to chase awy ennui; it is a production that puts each one In high good humor, its brightness and sprightliness of their very nature produoing an ir lection that the audie nea is only too willing to catch, and of which there is a feeling that it would Iain nave more Indeed, latt night the audience did have more than the original lines contained, for they would not rest contented until some of the forgs, choruses, etc, had been repeated 1 Oho plot tuics upon the complicated and at times embarrassing situations that arise out if the fact that Mr Dodge has practised a little deception upon his wife by attending a masked French ball without her knowledge and topped with a lady other than her w htm be promised to love and cherish As n sy readily be oonceived, this all'ords groundwork foralmoat Innumerable laughible incident s, and it haa been well takenad vantage cf The comedy consists of three acts, the first and last of which may be said to have the most direct connection with Mr Dodge acd bis ball escapade, the second act, by a mere thread of connection so far as the plot goes, being devoted to vaudeville This relieves to some extent extent the great amount of fun-making that renominates in the other two acts, wl iltt the vaudeville itself is of a very high cltts, the several turns, no matter whethur choruses, dances, songs or duets, being given with a fit inn, that is exceptianol The crmedy is given by the Henahaw-Teu Broack Company, and it is a decidedly strong combination combination The bulk of the fun-making, of course, falls upon the shoulders of the gen-tit gen-tit man who interprets the role of Mr Djrie, president of the Motquitovllle lUnk, and in this instance it Is Mr John E lleoshav, whose acting is marked by a naturalness, both of manner and facial expression, that la perfectly chaimirg He plays bis part without without aprearirg in any way to force the slightest slightest point, and in that lies much of the charm of his acting He is well supported by Mr Frank David, who sustains the character of Bsrnaby Potter, Mr Dodge's confidential cleik Of him it nrny be said that be possessed great ease of manner and never misses a point Mr William Blaisdell, with whom Montrealers have been acquainted acquainted in the past, Is with the company, and his reception was all that ever he oould desire To him is allotted the role of Alphonse d'Arville, waiter in a French restaurant, and he interprets it with that ability which has ever characterised his work As Zenobia Dodge, wife of the gentleman who is ra-rponsible ra-rponsible for all the trouhlo, May Ten Bioeck gives an admirable presentation of the part, and Mies Carlotta deplots Harriet Pelbtm, Mrs Dodge's unmarried sister, aith ability, whilst as Kqaeenzie, Mrs Dodge's maid, Clara Lavine endows the pirt with all the vivacity and artfulness for Which it calls McKce Rankin's play " The Canuck " wh plejid at the Theatre Francaia yesterday by the stock company to good houses The author, in his palmy days, made great Mo (being a Canadian himself) in the delineatlin of L'Habitant, and in the character of Jeta Btptiate Cadeaux scored an unqualified U)-cets U)-cets The play being of looal interest it ws naturally expeoted that Mr, Alex Kearney, who personates the leading role this wee'o, would receive a rousing reoeption, Doing a Mcntrialer himself and he did Mr, Kearney appears to have made a thorough ttudy of the part, and somewhat astonished Ma friends by the excellence with whioh hi portrajed the French Canadian dialeob Hi 'cited aid plajed the part to perfection, erd in the sceno where his erring daughter reiuirsto her home and begs his forgive-rers forgive-rers he was applauded to tha eoho Mr Kesitey sppcurs to have a proper oonoep- no of the part and at ooce sinks bis prrsrfslity in the delineation ot the Fm ch habitant Mr Keiruoy Mr JonnE HcrishiiB naa ably assisted by Mlas Beryl Hope, who trek the paitof Archange (his daughter) most acceptably, and won the deserved rltudits of the audience Mr Walter B AY'todall, as Cyrus Btebbins, played ths pirt to peilection, snd showed tht he walk diligent student Mr Alexanler Gaden ss the villain of the piece, and in the scene whire he attempts to burglarize the pre-n pre-n ises of Jean Baptiatewas very effjetive The play is well mounted, the soenery Is appropriate, appropriate, and "The Canuck" is an assured success for the balance of the week The vaudeville, as usual, is up to date, and Is headed by Mr Walter J Talbot, described ss s descriptive tenor, who sings somo ballads well Adeline Marden has a good voice, if a little harsh, and warbles some operatic airs in a fairly finished manner Hornmann does some tricks of legerdemain whioh are clever, if not new, and Dean and Jose, in their satire on rociety's four hundred, are a clever pair, alttongh their little skit is not the most refined In the world They are both clever, however, and well worth seeing The management are to be coogratulated on the general excellence of the performance, and the determination to produce nothing but first-class attractions should be noted and appreciated by their patrons The Theatre Royal is this week producing a melodrama based much on the lines of some of its old-time sensational attractions, of which there has been of late a lack It is 'The Great North-Weat," and when it is stated that the principal incidents oocur in a spot that is undergoing a boom, and wcere a horse thief is regarded as worse than a mur-d mur-d rer, the idea of exciting scenes will at once suggest itself And there is no dearth of thirr There is the arrival of the first railway railway train at Boom City; there is a rescue fiom a prairie fire; there is a trial for horse stealing, with every proipect of a lynching; there is a blizzard, during which a fight between between two enemies enaues, and there is a somewhat thrilling swing on one of the tails of windmill by a woman who wishes to save the life of the rrsn she loves Of villainy and plots for re-verge re-verge there is any amount ; and love, misplaced misplaced and otherwise, is dealt out in homio-rpathio homio-rpathio dotes, whilst veins of various types oi comedy come along at refreshingly opportune opportune

18971126: S , in charge of the instrumental instrumental measurement and astronomical astronomical work for the determinate determinate n of the iiist meridian Besides the ascertainment of the point at which the Yukon crossed that meridian The cbject of the expedition was to obtain, all possible information touching a large tract of country, as yet little known, forming the extreme northwesterly northwesterly portion of tho Northwest Territory Territory The Yukon district lies between between the northern boundary of British Columbia, lat 60, and the Arctic ocean, and between the 141st meridian, on the west, and the 136th meridian and the Rocky Mountain rHges, on the etust It has thus an approximate area of 192,000 pquare miles, which is about ten times the area of Nova Scotia or three times that of New F ngland As to Its general character, Dr Dawson thought It might be compared with the Russian province of Vologda, The province In question, Bituated between latitudes 68 and lnngtltu de 6!i, has an area, according according to the SUtenmn's Year-Book, of 155,498 square miles, and a population population of 1,239,705 Dr Dawson fixed upon upon Vologda, and not Archangel, because because it is Inland with respect to the White Sea, as the Yukon district Is inland, with respect to Behrlng Sea and the Yukon Delta, So far as isotherms are concerned, however, however, Archangel, would be, perhaps, a better parallel, though in its relulion to the Ural Mountains Vologda has conditions conditions that match the Canadian region Ilepworth Dixon began his Russian tour at the north and passed through both Archangel and Vologda His first stage was by tarantass from Solovetsk to Archangel Solovetsk is a town that has grown up around a famous convent (that of Saints Savatle and Zozlma) on an islet of the same name in Onega Bay, To this shrine emperor as well as peasants peasants have gone on pilgrimage There is a like delta of Isles and islets at the mouth of the Dowlna Having entered the river by the most convenient of Its twelve arms, the newcomer catches a glimpse of a forest of domes and spires the domes of all colors, the spires all golden This Is Archangel Having succeeded in landing, he finds a camp of shanties around groups of belfries and cupolas "Imagine a vast green marsh along the bank of a broad brown river, with mounds of clay cropping here and there out of the peat and bog; put buildings with frescos, crown them with cupolas and crosses; fill the space between between church and convent with piles and planks, so as to make ground for gardens, streets and yards; cut tw v wide lanes from the church called Smith's Wife' to the monastery of St Michael, three or four miles in length paint the walls of church and convent convent white, the domes green and blue, surround the log houses with open gardens; stick a geranium, a fuchsia, an oleander in every window; leave the gruss growing everywhere In street and clearing and there you havo Archangel " Archangel " Such is Hepworth Dixon's picture picture of the northern Russian seaport seaport IUt latitude 13 nearly the same as that of Dawson City Hul far fiom ArUiaisgcl is Hukn- og'ory, birth place of Lornonososoft, poet and philosopher, greatly honored by his countrymen It Is a city set on a hill, pretty and bright, with golden crops In Bight and grassy roads, pink and white houses on the wide streets, boats on the river and stretches of yellow yellow sunrl, churches, cloisters, and all around forests of pine and birch This northern part of Russia Just swarms with villages on both sides of the Artie Artie circle For navigation, however,' Archangel, Onega, and other eub-Aretlc Russian ports are not so favorably situated as those of Norway, Tromsoe and Hammerfest The latter, in lat 70 degrees, 40mlnutes, 11 seconds Is, so far, the most northerly town In the world It has a population of over 2,000 souls, and, though he can occasionally occasionally light his cigar at midnight with a sunglass, the Hammerfester is by no means cut off from the outer world Electric light, Introduced some years ago, Is in general use and one can telegraph In all directions Though; the inhabitants are said to be of a pensive pensive turn, they are not at all without enjoyments, They are Industrious and, besides the characteristic industries, in which the export of cod liver oil lias a prominent prominent place, there are shops of all kinds and the fashions are not unknown unknown St Petersburg Is In the latitude latitude (60 degrees) of the southern boundary boundary of the Yukon district North of that line are some Important Russian provinces west of the Urals, the Grand Duchy of Finland, nearly the whole of Norway and a considerable portion of Sweden On the American continent the Isotherms Isotherms correspond With parallels of latitude much less than they do In the old world Mr, Dull, who was the first to write about Alaska, at the transfer to the United States, und in Whose statements Dr Dawson generally generally places confidence, says that the winters on the Yukon may be coni-pared coni-pared to those of Canada and Minnesota Minnesota The air Is crisp and cold, with occasional blizzards The mid-winter temperature may average 30 degrees below zero (Fan ) The summer comes on with amazing rapidity and during the mosquito season life Is unendurable unendurable without a net or leather gloves About May 20 the river bursts Its bonds and the lowlands are flooded The cry of the brant, sailing northward, northward, Is heard, and all the minor forms of life are afoot, on the wing or creeping creeping In the low grass Vegetation springs at a bound Into leaf and (lower Both Dr Dawson and Mr Ogllvle devote devote some attention to the agricultural capacities of the Yukon district The former quotes Mr James Anderson, of the Hudson Bay Company, in proof of the fact, questioned by Petroff, that potatoes and barley were grown at Fort Yukon From all that he hai learned by personal observation and otherwise Dr, Dawson did not hesitate hesitate to affirm that such hardy crops as barley, rye, turnips and flax could be successfully raised as far north as the former site of Fort Selkirk near the 63rd parallel It is also Interesting Interesting to know that excellent summer grazing for horses and cattle can be found along the river-valleys, whllo natural hay-meadows are frequent In appendix I Dr Dawson gives important important Information as to the distribution distribution of trees and In appendix III a verified list of the plants that he collected collected In the Yukon district and adjacent adjacent parts of British Columbia, Mr Ogilvie, though not enthusiastic as to the agricultural capabilities of the Pelly-Yukon basin, mentions some tracts here and there that admit of cultivation For Instance, there is Ogilvie valley (so called in his honor by the chief of the expedition) Northward Northward from the end of Lake Labarge, mixed timber poplar and spruce occurs occurs of a size that betokens fair Boll, whllo the herbasc is rnore than usually usually rich for tfial region Several such exceptional tracts are mentioned On the whole, however, Mr Ogllvle forma a very moderate estimate of tu$ total area of agricultural land In the Yukon district He thinks that 3G0 square miles would be a generous allowance That would make 230,400 acres or about 1,000 farms for the Yukon-I'clly baBin, and he estimates the available land on the affluents of the river at about the same figure It Is to the discovery and development of its mineral wealth that, In his judgment, the region will owe whatever prosperity is In store for It The Yukon country has long been the scene of missionary labor and Mr Ogilvie acknowledges its good effects on some of the Indians with whom he came In contact The Greek Church had established missions In Alaska before the transfer to the United States The Roman Catholic Church has a large staff of workers engaged There was an Anglican missionary at Fort Yukon as early as 1861, and Presbyterian, Me-thodlst Me-thodlst and Moravian missionaries carry carry on the work of evangelization on both sides of the frontier Now that provision has been made for the maintenance maintenance of law and order In the district, district, the residents will enjoy that security of person and property which pertains to a civilized community and the future development of that great lone land will be awaited with Interest There are no quarrels eo hitter as family quarrels, and this holds good of newspapers as well an individuals Tho dispute between the two loading Liberal Liberal papers of BritiHh Columbia, the Victoria Times and tho Vancouver World, waxes hotter and hotter as the days go by The Times describes the World's editorial as "a splenetic Jeremiad," Jeremiad," and the World retorts by calling the Times' Editor (Senator Templemun) an unsuccessful fabricator, who went round, hat In hand, pauper-like, Imploring Imploring the assistance and influence of everyone with whom he came In contact contact The World has two columns and a

for three long hours the belated passengers waited the arrival of the wrecking train That the storm was confined to a lim ited area was demostrated In the fact that the Delaware & Hudson train, due at 7,30, was only two hours and a half late, and the detention was at St Johns This was also further accentuated by the non-arrival of the Halifax express, due at 6 50, but which was six hours late, owing to the storm in the eastern part of the province According 'to despatches received at headquarters last evening the blizzard seemed to be raging in all Its force In a westerly direction The No 1

another electric car This was parti, ularly the case on Windsor street, Park Avenue, Amherst Amherst and St Denis streets The "Point service was not Interfered with, the roadmnstor having a large gang

We have not agreed to relinquish (t to the Cubans we relinquish- It to the United Stales " Thus, crystalizing their reasoning and insistence, the Spaniards bind debt and Hoviruignty together, and urge that the relinquishment must be to the United States While this contention Is keenly and vigorously supported It has not shaken the position of the Americans, who cut the thread of Spanish diplomacy In the middle of the word "relinquish" by practically assuring the Spanlurds that thiy need not cherish anxiety as to whom to relinquish; but to conform to the fourth article of the pivtocol, which pledges Spain, "that Cuba Porto Kbo and oilier Spanish Islunils of the West Indies shall be immediately evacuated " ltriclly, the American resimnsu to Spanish diplomacy of construction tnd definition was that the words "rclln-o,ulsh" "rclln-o,ulsh" and "evacuate" arelulert-hung---olile and have the same meaning Thus, threw seHsions were given up to a-tlently a-tlently meeting Spain's views and

18990705: GEORGE AND THE DRAGON A writer, who evidently knows his subject thoroughly not by hearsay, but by experience, discusses in Black-Wood Black-Wood the value of Wei-Hal -Wei The policy by which it was acquired and the terms 'by which it is held, he docs not approve of Its seizure was the result of surprise That Russia would eventually occupy Port Arthur was locked upon by those who had been watching events as fairly certain, and yet the occupation came so suddenly that it proved almost as disconcerting as if such a thing had never been contemplated as possible The British Government through the press and otherwise let the world know that Russia's action had flurried it For a time there was a great deal of talk about the open door and then, a squadron having been sent to Cheefoo, over against Port Arthur seventy miles off, Wei-Hai-Wel was taken possession possession of and a clause was inserted in the lease that England would hold It a long as Russia remained at Port Arthur What that means it is not hard to decipher It was authoritatively authoritatively given out that the Government intended to make Wei-Hai-Wei a sec ondary naval base Under certain circumstances such a course might be wise enough; but, in view of the fact that Russia is rapidly turning Port Arthur into a first class fortress, with an absolutely Impregnable harbor capable of sheltering 100 torpedo boats or 50 destroyers of the "Sokol" type, such a policy would he a grave strategic strategic error In fact, Wei-Hai-Wei Is worse than useless to England unless a defensible harbor is constructed there and the island adequately fortified fortified If the necessary breakwater were commenced at once, all that could bs effectively accomplished before Russia could have her strategic railways railways completed and be ready (if such action were deemed advisable) to begin begin an advance upon Peking The writer In Blackwcod admits (though not without sarcasm) that Lord Salisbury Salisbury may have information of which he knows nothing, but he has no faith in secrecy or the pretence of It In these days of an ubiquitous press The question in which the Empire is concerned especially that Important portion of it that is interested In Chinese trade is whether the Government Government really purposes to defend the trade interests of northern China If so, the policy indicated may have Its use Now, moreover, moreover, is the time to act, when Russia is in peaceful mood and friendly her strategic railways being still unfinished unfinished and Port Arthur being dependent on the sea routes for Its supplies What about the climate ofWei-Hal-Wei? It would be an insult to that future strong-hold, says the writer writer in Blackwood, to compare It to Hong-Kong, and it is not hot and relaxing relaxing like Yokohama In fine, he believes believes it to tie the healthiest in the world Spring and autumn are magnificent magnificent There Is adequate rainfall, plenty of sunshine, and though the four months' winter is cold, It is a bright, clear, dry, bracing cold, with neither raid nor fog, and but little snow Still, he mentions occasional blizzards "an average perhaps of one a fortnight whioh sometimes bring a little snow and blow from west round to north While these blizzards last from one day to three days the air is "keen and cutting, but quite dry " The weather between blizzards is compared to that of the Riviera in winter and even superior to It, being drier and more bracing with more brilliant sunshine We have outlined only the practical features of the article Lord Beres-ford's Beres-ford's proposals are condemned as dividing the powers of civilization Into Into two great hoBtile camps But he considers China's disintegration as only' a matter of time The great wall of exclusion is a thing of the past The era of the railway has begun begun The remotest interior will soon be open to foreign trade, England must share her monopoly with others, ibut she has held her own before under under unfavorable circumstances and she need not despair now The proposal to give the Northwest half-breeds another issue of land scrip may be in the interest of somebody, but certainly it is not in that of the half-breeds A;'tcr the rising of 1S85 a commi&aion was sent up to settle the 'bleeds' claims with scrip, and most of the stuff passed into the hands of speculartora within a tow hours of issue It cost the Government a large sum, and did the recipients the least p -ssiUe amount of good It will he the saint with future issues The half-breed does not take to farming and does not need land, else he could get all he wants on the same conditions conditions as white settlers He ia a picturesquely picturesquely decaying survival of a past time, to pamper whom is to waste money The English landlady who refused to serve a feminine cyclist because she wore bloomers has been paralleled by a landlord who had a lady ejected by the police because she persisted in smoking a cigarette He also prosecuted prosecuted her for disorderly conduct in refusing to leave the premises when ordered The magistrate dismissed the summons, but lipid that the landlord was right la malfrY g and enfoj-cing a rule against ladies' smoking, as it "might tend to make the lewder and less thoughtful members of society rather inclined to Joking " And this while it may tend to promote morality in public, seems to be somewhat Ulie punishing a woman for man's rudeness Mr

military age in the Transvaal Is spoken of as available for field service, and as the force which the British troops, If war breaks out, will have to overcome The nature of the conditions under which the Boers live enables their Government Government to gather a larger proportion of the people into the fighting line than is usually the case But it does not give any such force as many calculate on The lransvaai is open m uav from three sides, and through its ter ritory, besides Johannesburg, are sev eral large English communities, which will require the watching presence or considerable Boer corps Many passes will also have to be watched, as the Boers will not be sure from whence attack will come Even with the Free State's aid it is doubtful If the Transvaal generals will be able to assemble in any one place, or to maintain maintain for any length of time, brigades of more than a few thousand men There is no Boer commissariat and no hospital service such as a protracted struggle would render necessary Tbura are already in Nattl two British brigades, brigades, complete in infantry, cavalry and atti'llery, quite as strong as any Boer army that could likely be kept long In the field If there is war, and, unfortunately, it seems too likely, the Boers will learn and that quickly that the detachments they triumphed over In 1880-81 were not the strength of the British army, and that their cause today is a hopeless one Windsor, during the recent school discussion, was frequently pointed to as a city where Catholio and Protestant Protestant dwelt together in educational unity, and as a sample of what would be the rule in Manitoba when the Martin-Sifton anti-Catholic school law was fully in operation The attention drawn to the Windsor plan seems to have been the presage of Its death Bishop McEvoy, who has spiritual oversight of the Windsor Catholics, has condemned the mixed schools, and demands for the children of his flock separate institutions under Catholio control, and evidently means that his demands shall be complied with It is a pity that what in so many ways is a good thing should not longer exist as an example of what should be The Ontario Government, it Is- said, will Intervene to prevent the production production of its members' telegrams in connection with the North Waterloo election case Why a" Government should object to its messages on pulb-11c pulb-11c business being made public Is not at once perceived It is not well, though, that telegrams should be too easily obtained in connection with court proceedings A man's message sent over the wires should be as secret secret to outsiders as his letter sent through the mails The ordering of the Grenadier Guards from Gibraltar to Natal, on the day of their Intended departure for horns, looks like the first part of the answer to the Orange Free State's declaration of sympathy with the Transvaal Boers It Is another indication that those who know most of the situation are among those who see least hope of peace in it It looks much as if England would soon have on her hands wars both in South and North Africa The Governor-General has decided not to go to the laying of the Chicago Chicago Government building corner stone Whatever the cause It is probable probable that nothing will be lest by his absence There are occasions when the head of the country's government may properly appear

M HARRY FURNISS ON CANADA Mr Harry Furniss, the artist and caricaturist, has been to Canada and In the Windsor Magazine, out today, he has an Interesting article illustrated illustrated with his own sketches on his impressions impressions of Canada Departing from his accustomed satirical style, Mr Furniss describes all he saw and learned of Canada in the sober spirit of one who has been Impressed w-Jth the enormous capabilities of the country, country, and the vision of the future which is in store for it "It is, he says enthusiastically, "a fine country a country of the future, a country for xne young ana vigorous It has endless endless resources, and above all, a charming charming climate " He makes it plain that In the matter of climate "Our Lady of the Snows," has been sadly misrepresented misrepresented He found Canada In January, milder than the sunny south of France, Having testified to tils pleasures and amenities of Canadian life, he turns seriously to discuss the question which to Canada is the- most ssrious of all questions Why is it that the development development of Canada proceeds so slowly? With wealth enough In fertile lands, minerals and forests to maintain a population population of one hundred m lliona the Dominion Dominion today has less than six millions This has puzzled Mr Furniss, who, while avoiding the vexed questions ot trade regulations, seem to point out that Canada's chief hindrance is the lack of good markets The Nova i o-tlan o-tlan farmer cannot go into the nearest big city, Boston, with his produce because because of the hostile tariff It is the same with the miner, and the iron and steel iruanuifacture The same trouble meets the farmers and manufacturers ot the Northwest ana British Columbia Columbia So much has this been felt, continues continues Mr Furniss, who quotes the experience of Canadian farmers, that over one million Canadians have been forced to give up their land and homes and emigrate to the United States, There must foe something wrong In the fiscal policy which makes it imperative imperative for so many to kave their own rich country for the blizzard-swept states of Minnesota, Nebraska and Kansas Allowing for the fact that better times In the last two or three years have brought many Canadians back to their own country, there Is yet much that ought to be done In the work of building up a great and powerful powerful dominion The tmtr? tion of the Scotch crofters, the Irish farmers, the EngJish yeoman, to help fill up the great empty country, should, be pushed more vigorously than It la This British British immigration, and the further encouragement encouragement of trade exchange with the Mother Country should be the foremost policy of Canadians today
