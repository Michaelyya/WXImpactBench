"18800116","A. Shea, agent for the Allan Co, who has entire charge of the vessel, and is pressing on the repairs with all due speed. The want of a graving dock to effect such repairs as she requires is once more demonstrated, and it is to be hoped initiatory steps will soon be taken to secure such a desideratum. Since a week before Christmas the weather has been unusually cold and stormy, the thermometer, on one or two occasions, having been four degrees below zero, a very uncommon occurrence so early in the winter. On New Year's Day we had a heavy snowstorm. OUR LONDON LETTER. A Christmas for The Sheffield election Conservative demonstration in Le Tne Tlehnorne claimant Loss of the Borsnsln The small birds. From our own correspondent London, January 24, 1879. Christmas day has brought the densest and most disagreeable fog that we have experienced in London for some years. In this suburb St John's Wood which is generally comparatively free from fog, it is impossible at mid-day to make out even the outline of any object on the opposite side of the road, and the condition of the central parts of the metropolis, where the fog usually contains a considerable admixture of smoke, must be much worse. Diners out will have some difficulty in reaching their destination, for all traffic, except on the underground railway is necessarily suspended, and few undertakings are so dubious as the attempt to find one's way, in a dense fog, to a particular house in an unfamiliar quarter. Consequently there will be many vacant chairs at Christmas dinner tables today. The result of the Sheffield elections has been a surprise for most of us, not because the Liberal candidate has won, but because the Conservative party made such a gallant fight for the vacant seat. To poll within five hundred votes of their opponents in such a hotbed of Radicalism as Sheffield is unquestionably a triumph for the Government; and there can no longer be any doubt that a very large number of electors in the large constituencies who formerly supported Mr. Gladstone, are now followers of Lord Beaconsfield. It should be remembered that this is the first opportunity we have had of testing the relative strength of parties in the great boroughs since the Manchester election three years ago; and opinions were very much divided as to the effect which subsequent events have produced upon the minds of the independent section of electors whose votes decide every close contest. The Conservatives were by no means confident of making even a creditable spar, although they assumed a bold front to the last. They had been disappointed by the refusal of their most promising candidate, Mr. Mark Addy, to contest the seat; they had to put up with a young man, Mr. Stuart Wortley, a nephew of the Earl of Wharncliffe, of no local influence within experience or distinction except by connection with a noble family; and on the other side was arrayed an organisation which ever since Sheffield received the franchise, has monopolised the representation of the borough, and signally defeated every attempt to dispute its supremacy. Mr. Waddy, moreover, was a strong candidate. If, as a temperance man, he alienated the sympathies of the publicans, on the other hand he secured the adherence of the Permissive Bill party, who muster strongly in Sheffield. His opinions were advanced enough by securing the support of the Radicals to prevent the division of strength which has often been so fatal in Radical constituencies. He was especially recommended to the deluded idiots who still believe in the innocence of the Claimant; and on the Saturday before the election, the Irish vote, so strong, was pledged in his favor. Three Irish members of Parliament Sullivan, Finigan, and Justin McCarthy strongly urged their fellow-countrymen to support Mr. Waddy. They said that he had given satisfactory assurances that he had promised seriously to consider Irish questions, and to vote for an alteration of the land laws; and their exhortations were supported by a telegram from Mr. Parnell, calling upon every Irishman to aid in defeating the Government upon their chosen ground. The effect of all this was to throw the Irish vote en bloc into the Liberal scale at the last moment, and there can be no doubt that it decided the result of the election. How many moderate Liberals were disgusted by this coquetting with the Home Rule party we have no means of ascertaining, but it is probable that the loss was far inferior to the gain. Mr. Waddy owes his seat, therefore, to the Irish element in this constituency, and it is probable that Mr. Parnell and his influences will be able, as they had boasted, to influence the elections in about a dozen of our largest constituencies in the same manner. At the last elections in 1874 the Conservatives deemed themselves so weak in Sheffield that they ran no candidate of their own and supported Mr. Roebuck in order to keep out Mr. Chamberlain, now the radical member for Birmingham. They succeeded. In 1868 they started a candidate who only polled about 5,000 votes against a gross total of 42,000 on the other side. At the next general elections they may or may not be successful. The battle will then be fought on the new register, which has added some 3,000 votes to the Liberal strength; but there is a delightful uncertainty about the ballot which falsifies the most careful calculation. It is needless to remark that the result of the election has cast a gloom over the councils of the opposition. If they can only just manage to win in Sheffield, what hope have they of carrying the constituencies in Lancashire and Yorkshire, where, if public opinion has changed in the same degree as at Sheffield, their prospects must be well-nigh hopeless, with or without the help of the Irishmen. The Conservative demonstration at Leeds organized to give Sir Stafford Northcote an opportunity of replying to Mr. Gladstone's criticisms upon his financial policy, was successful, not only in point of numbers, but political effect. The Chancellor of the Exchequer showed himself thoroughly capable of defending his measures, and met Mr. Gladstone very fairly upon the statistical argument. It is significant, however, that he claimed the right to set off against the deferred extraordinary expenditures, which last April, were already nearly four millions, the reduction effected in the national debt by the extended creation of terminable annuities and the new sinking fund, from which it is inferred that the Government will meet their difficulties next year by boldly transferring that portion of the floating debt for which they are responsible to the funded debt, just as the special appropriation from the Indian Exchequer for the Famine Fund has been recklessly expended upon the Afghan war. This would certainly not be an unpopular measure, for the taxpayers quake at the prospect of having to meet a deficit in the ordinary budget and the payment of deferred liabilities together, would otherwise be the case; and they will be thankful for relief in whatever shape it comes. The Tichborne Association propose to put the Claimant in candidature for Nottingham at the general election. That interesting criminal has almost completed seven years of his term of penal servitude, and his friends are endeavoring to upset the sentence upon a writ of error, and thus obtain his release. The objection taken is purely technical. The power of the Judge to sentence him to penal servitude for seven years is not disputed, of course. The contention of the Claimant's friends is that that term exhausted the punitive power: but inasmuch as the Lord Chief Justice passed the sentence, it will probably prove to be duly supported by legal authority and precedents. We have very meagre accounts of the loss of the Borussia, the Dominion Line steamer which foundered in the Atlantic but it is suspected that she was not seaworthy, and more than hinted that the crew left the passengers to their fate. The statements of the survivors are conflicting, one of them admitting at first that there was a panic on board the ill-fated vessel, and that the crew lowered the boats without orders; the others earnestly asseverating that nothing of the kind happened. There were no passengers in the boat that was picked up. Her crew consisted of three of the officers and half a dozen seamen, a fact which points not so much to a save qui peut as the deliberate abandonment of the passengers. A Board of Trade enquiry is to be immediately held upon the disaster. It has been remarked that our stock of small birds has greatly diminished since last year. The hard winter killed a good many of them, and the survivors were again thinned by the wet weather in the summer, which, moreover, prevented them from breeding. The woods and hedges are now comparatively deserted. Last winter, too, during the cold weather, numbers of small birds were driven to seek for food in the gardens of the London suburbs, where ordinarily speaking nothing but smoky sparrows are to be seen. This year, instead of a small flock of linnets, finches, robins, thrushes, starlings and other winter residents, there is scarcely even a house sparrow. Perhaps our feathered friends took timely notice of the approaching frost and migrated to summer climes; but it is generally thought that most of them are dead.

The annual distribution of prizes at the St. Mary's Cnterhistical Teaching Society was held in St. Mary's Cathedral today; His Grace the Archbishop presided and presented the prizes. Waiting for the Sarmatian, Halifax, NS, February 1, The weather all morning was as mild as in spring, and the atmosphere fairly clear, but about 3 o'clock thick weather set in, followed by a snowstorm. Up to the hour of telegraphing there has been no sign of the Sarmatian, which shows that she must have experienced rough weather or she would have made the coast today, being one of the finest transatlantic steamers; however, Capt. Aird is one of Messrs. Allan's most cautious commanders and prefers perfect safety to speed. It is generally believed that the Sarmatian is now off the harbor, and as soon as the snowstorm ceases, will come in. The Princess will not land till the morning. Every arrangement has been made by the Allan agents; the whole staff of clerks are now in the office, waiting the signal. Midnight bundling snowstorm just set in, with heavy gusts of wind, which makes it impossible for the Sarmatian to come in tonight. If she was anywhere near the mouth of the harbor, she has probably put out to sea again. Chicago, February 1, Hon. Joseph Edward Canchon, Lieut-Governor of Manitoba, and Miss Emma De St-Denis Lemoine, daughter of the Clerk of the Canadian Senate, were married in a very quiet and informal manner at the Cathedral of the Holy Name in this city at 3:30 p.m. today, the Right Rev. Dr. McMullen, administrator of the diocese, officiating. Governor Canchon arrived from Manitoba on Saturday and stopped at the Grand Pacific Hotel, and the bride, accompanied by her brother F. St. Denis Lemoine, arrived from Ottawa later and went to the same hotel. The Governor and his bride will leave by the morning train for Manitoba. The groom is 63 and the bride 23 years of age. THE CANADA GAZETTE, Ottawa, February 1, The Canada Gazette of yesterday contained a proclamation of a reward of $200 for such information as will lead to the apprehension and conviction of the murderer or murderers of mounted policeman Grabum. A Downing Street circular encloses a copy of a note received through the Foreign Office from the Netherlands Minister in London, announcing the repeal of the decree of his government prohibiting the introduction into Holland of potatoes from the United States. An imperial order-in-council giving effect to the convention between Great Britain and the Swiss Confederation, signed at Berne on the 8th of December, prolonging the duration of the treaty of the 31st of March, 1874, for the mutual extradition of fugitives criminals, is published. Sports and Pastimes, Twenty-three members of the Independent Snow-shoe Club started on Saturday afternoon to tramp to Chambly Basin, arriving there about seven o'clock. They found awaiting them at the Bellevue House a most substantial dinner, prepared and served in the excellent style of Mr. Portiers, the proprietor. It is needless to say that, after their long tramp, the snowshoers did ample justice to the good things provided. After dinner, an adjournment to the parlor took place, where, with music and dancing, a most enjoyable evening was spent. Toronto, January 31, There is a good deal of sporting news current this morning. Dick, of the Scottish Football Association, is expected here shortly to arrange for a Canadian tour of the Scottish Association. An athletic association will shortly be formed in the city to protest against hippodroming. Amongst the promoters are A. Muir, John Scales, David Brown and others. An informal challenge appears in this evening's Telegram from a Toronto citizen, offering to wrestle Ross for $500 cash up. A petition is in circulation asking that the Queen's plate be run for at Woodbine track, Toronto, not only this coming season but in perpetuity, on the grounds that it was originally voted for Carleton track and that Woodbine is its successor. The races this year are to continue three days, and the stakes will be heavy. Belleville, January 31, The first rink of a curling match between Old Countrymen and Canadians for the Pitcairn medal was played on the curling rink on Thursday last. The Old Country players won by a majority, the score being 20 to 10. Wareham, January 31, Four Grit curlers from Blue Vale challenged four Conservative curlers from Tingham today. After three hours of play, the match resulted in favor of the Conservatives by six shots. BOSTON, February 1, Sailed: Plymouth and Iowa for Liverpool.

"18800203","H. Pfilxcess Louse, Bale vital at Halite after a storm Eautax, February 3. The snowstorm abated about 3 o'clock this morning, and then clear weather set in, with biting cold. A steamer was signalled from the east shortly after 6 o'clock, which proved to be the George Shattuck, from St. Pierre. At 9 o'clock another signal went up for steamer east. At 15 minutes to 11 three guns were fired from the Citadel hill, which announced that the lookout party at tamper down had made out the steamer to be the Sarmatian, and that she was then some four miles from the coast, in charge of a pilot. A moment later the mail steamer signals were hoisted, and as if by magic, flags, bunting and streamers floated from the flagstaff at the dockyard, the various public buildings and all the leading stores and private residences, while the shipping in the harbor and at the wharves were decorated from stem to stern, and streets and wharves were immediately crowded with sightseers. As the Sarmatian steamed slowly up the harbor, the Union Jack was lowered from the Citadel flagstaff, and the Royal Standard floated in its place, while the signal staffs were handsomely dressed with bunting. At 12 o'clock the Sarmatian dropped anchor off the Ordnance Yard, accompanied by the Commissariat transport Lily, in which His Excellency the Governor-General had steamed down to the mouth of the harbor to meet him. As His Royal Highness stepped from the Lily onto the landing stage a ringing cheer rose from the people on the wharf, while a royal salute thundered forth from the Citadel. The Princess was received by His Honor the Lt-Governor, Lady Macuongall, Col. Drayson and His Worship the Mayor. She wore a fur cap and a silk jacket lined with fur. Her face was covered with a white veil. She looked in good health, but a little pale. The Sarmatian encountered boisterous weather during the entire passage, and was delayed by incessant head winds and gales. The Princess suffered much from seasickness, and kept her state-room during the whole voyage. She is now recovering, and with rest will soon be restored to her usual health. The Marquis and Princess leave for Ottawa in a special train at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning."
"18800204","226J28 5,033,480 CITT MARKETS TUESDAY Farmers were scarce at the markets today, but buyers being scarcer, offerings were fully equal to requirements, and price ruled about as last quoted. The snowstorm today was an effectual check to business, which footed up a very limited aggregate. In grain, the only sales reported referred to oats on a basis of 65c to 75c per bag. Potatoes, although not in large supply, met with a very indifferent demand at 45c to 50c per bag. Apples continue to be forwarded from this city to the British markets via Halifax and Portland at the rate of eight to twelve carloads per week. Dealers at last report a better inquiry for local purposes, but owing to the poor quality of much of the stock stored here, prices do not make any great headway. The supply of dressed beef was largely in excess of the demand, forequarters selling at 25c to 34c as to condition, and hindquarters at 41c to 58c. Two very prime hindquarters sold at 60c, but this was an exceptional transaction. Mutton carcasses were disposed of at 5c per lb. Butter was in small supply, and eggs plentiful. The fish market wore a deserted appearance today, although there were some tempting lots of speckled brook trout, fine haddock, halibut, and white fish. The busy time, however, for this market is close at hand, as Lent commences on Wednesday, February 11th. Dressed hogs were in excess of the demand, and sales were made at $6.00 to $6.25 by the single carcass for nice fresh killed light averages, and we hear of one extra fine hog selling at $6.50.

"18800205","W. Ogilvie & Co. of Montreal purpose erecting a large grain warehouse on Main Street, south of Mr. Russet's store, as soon as the material can be procured. It is to be thirty feet wide and one hundred feet long. There will be a store in the front, and its capacity will be 25,000 bushels. Farmers get good value for their grain in Morris. WEEKLY REVIEW OF THE PRODUCE AND PROVISION MARKET Montreal, February 5. The fierce wintry weather by which February was ushered in continued until late at night on 3rd instant, and it appears to have been experienced over a wide extent of country in the United States as well as in Canada, it having been particularly severe along the North Atlantic coast. The changes during the past eight days in this city and vicinity were remarkable. Last Friday morning 6 below zero was registered, the temperature rising during the day to a maximum of 32, the range being 38.3 within twelve hours, with rain in the evening. A blinding snowstorm and bitterly cold wind ushered in the present month on Sunday morning, the temperature falling rapidly, the registered reading next morning being 11 to 13 below zero, according to situation. On Tuesday morning (temp 6 to 9 below) one of the severest snowstorms of the season commenced, continuing during the day and far into the night, clearing somewhat yesterday. There has, of course, been a good deal of obstruction to travel and trade, and in some places the country roads are blocked by snowdrifts. The experiment of laying a railway track across the river on the ice, between Hochelaga and Longueuil, proved successful on the 30th ult., and loaded freight cars, drawn by locomotive, are now frequently in transit. Latest advices from Europe were by Atlantic Cable to date, and by mail per SS Sarmatian, dates from Liverpool being up to the 22nd ult. BREADSTUFFS Wheat, inactive; Flour, dull and easier.

Farmers in attendance at the Bonsecours, Jacques Cartier Square, and St Ann's markets were chiefly from nearby points, the bad state of the country roads preventing them from coming long distances. Several farmers from the south side of the river took occasion to poke fun at the weather prophet. One jolly old representative of the agriculture bureau, who was rather late in disposing of his produce, caused considerable merriment by suddenly buttoning up his overcoat and pulling down his ear-laps, as though a heavy snowstorm was raging. He then ended the performance by looking up at the bright blue sky and roaring out ""Poor old Vennor."" Oats were in fair supply, although not as large as upon the last two or three market days. The demand, however, was much better, and offerings changed hands at pretty full rates. A purchaser of a load of oats stated that he had to pay the same price for the lot as he could have bought a single bag for, which was 73c. Sales were made at from 70c to 75c per bag of two bushels, the quality being generally very good. Several sales of buckwheat transpired at 45c and 50c per bushel, but the offerings were limited. No particular change was noticeable in vegetables, except in potatoes, which might be called a trifle easier in price, sales of very choice Early Rose being made at 50c per bag of 90 lbs. There is a good local inquiry for onions, which are firm at $3.00 per barrel. Several lots have been picked up lately by American buyers at $3.00. In Boston and New York they are scarce, and wanted at $4.00 to $5.00 per barrel. Florida tomatoes bring $2.25 per box of 14 lbs. Fresh lettuces are quoted at $1.15 to $1.20 per dozen. Some very fine specimens of rhubarb grown at Cote St Catherines were for sale at $1.50 per dozen bunches. The fruit market was dull and inactive. Apples were plentiful and the quantity of damaged fruit offering had a depressing effect upon the value of some of the better qualities. Choice selected Spitz, Russets, and Baldwins being scarce were steady. Shipments continue to move forward from this city to Great Britain regularly every week. About 900 have been shipped this week via Halifax and Portland. Stocks here are at present estimated by men in the trade at about 15,000 to 20,000 barrels, which show a gradual reduction, but not sufficient to indicate that they will be got rid of any too early. Sales of 25 to 50 bbl lots are reported for Eastern Townships destination at $2.75 per bbl. Savannah strawberries, although considered an unusually early luxury in this city, move off slowly at $1 per quart. Oranges are steady at $6.50 to $7 per case, and lemons at $8 to $9.50 per case. For dressed beef, there was a slow market at low figures. The supply of dressed hogs was light, and prices were about steady. The offerings of choice fruit and tub butter were very small, and prices for such descriptions were firm. On the other hand, there was a more liberal supply of inferior grades in tubs than has been noticed for some time past, and these brought lower figures. Guaranteed new-laid eggs were freely offered at 20c per dozen. The fish market was quiet, but the small supply of both fresh and salt descriptions caused prices to rule firm.

From the yards, it is delivered at $5.50 for maple; $5.00 for birch; $4.50 for beech; $3.00 for tamarack and $3.00 for hemlock. Eggs The following circular has been issued by a produce commission firm in this city: The mild weather of the past ten days has brought in a very considerable quantity of eggs to this market, which, in addition to the quantities of limed and packed eggs previously on hand, gives us large stocks. Prices have declined very materially. I quote limed and packed 10c, fresh 15c. If present weather continues fresh eggs will not be worth over 12c within few days. Dressed Hogs The movement of live and dressed hogs at Chicago (exclusive of the receipts of the latter by teams) during the winter packing season just closed was as follows: Receipts, live, 2,691,864 dressed, 78,952; total, 2,770,816.

At the sale on Tuesday evening 8,700 bales were disposed of, nearly one-half of which was of Port Phillip and Sydney. Prices were unaltered. THE RETAIL PRODUCE MARKET Friday, March 5 The usual activity noticed on market days at Bonsecours and Jacques Cartier square was wanting this morning, the attendance of both buyers and sellers being small, owing to an old-fashioned March snowstorm prevailing. The grain supply being light, was disposed of at firm rates. Oats sold at 73c 75c per bag, 80c being asked for a few choice samples. Buckwheat was rather scarce, but sales transpired at Tuesday's figures, namely 4jc a 50c per bushel. Peas were in good request and sold at the range of 80c 90c as to quality. In vegetables there was no particular change. Potatoes met with a somewhat improved enquiry, but the offerings were fully equal to it, and late prices ruled. Other kinds of roots and vegetables were about as last quoted. Dressed hogs were lower, sales being made at $5.80 per 100 lbs by the single carcass. We quote $5.15 a $5.80. More dressed poultry was offered than required, and prices were in favor of purchasers. The supply of butter was rather limited, but the demand therefor being slow, values did not exhibit much change, prints brought 25c per lb, and common to fair qualities 18c 22c per lb. Eggs New laid 20c 25c per dozen. In fruit, we find a very quiet business transpiring. Apples meet with an unsatisfactory local demand at prices varying according to quality from $1.50 $3.50 per barrel. Small orders from nearby country points are being filled at $2.75 $3.00. Choice selected and repacked Spits, Russets, Baldwins and Spies are quoted at $3.50 $4.00 per barrel. Southern Strawberries Strawberries are selling at $1.00 per quart. Oranges remain steady at $6.50 $7.00 per case, and lemons are very scarce and dear, the price having jumped up to $10.00 per case. The fish trade was dull, but prices were steady.

New York, March 15 The strike of the piano makers appears as far from settlement as ever; both sides express determination not to yield. Several of the factories in which the men have been steadily at work were closed today, in compliance with the recent resolution of the piano makers' association, and the locked out men will have to stay out until sent for. All negotiations for a compromise between employers and employees are at an end for the present. New York, March 15 A private meeting of the Piano Manufacturers Association was held this afternoon. It is understood that five other firms agreed to close their factories tomorrow, throwing out about five hundred more men. The Piano Makers Union has been in session all day, and the men are determined not to return to work in any of the factories unless an increase of 10 percent is paid to them. New York, March 15 Tammany is going en masse to Cincinnati during the Democratic convention next June. Fire Commissioner Gorman has been made Quartermaster of the delegation from New York and he leaves tomorrow for that city for the purpose of hiring a hotel and suitable quarters for the braves and chiefs. Tilden's nomination is to be opposed at all hazards, and every one of the braves is to endeavor to make the strife warm, bitter and as successful as possible. To this end not less than 500 representatives of wigwams are to be provided with railroad tickets and free lodgings in Cincinnati during the convention. Tammany proposes to do things in royal style, and money will flow as freely as water for the entertainment of Tammanyites and their friends, their intention being to show the Western and Southern delegates that Tammany is not mere local faction and is able to defeat Tilden in his own state, should he be nominated.

THE UNIVERSITY BOAT RACE Last updates; Oxford London, March 15 As the day of the annual University boat race approaches, speculation increases upon the result of the event; the betting, which has varied with the apparent relative condition of the crews, is today 9 to 4 on Oxford. No changes have been made in the personnel of the crews since the latter part of February, and barring accidents, the eights, which now attract such crowds to the bank of the Thames, to witness their practice, are the same which will play a momentous part in the contest of next Saturday. Notwithstanding there were reports in circulation a short time since that the race would be rowed down the river from Mortlake to Putney, instead of upwards on the road from Putney to Mortlake, it is now understood that the latter programme will be adhered to as certain to afford a much fairer test of the merits of both crews than the former, when owing to the peculiar configuration of the river, the crew lucky enough to get the Middlesex station has almost a controlling advantage.

KEW BRUNSWICK, St. Joes, March 16. The battery at Fort Dufferin is to be extended. Today Chief Justice Allen gave his decision in the application for a postponement of the trial of the Queen vs. Tower. His Honor stated he had examined the papers carefully, and said he was unable to see any reason in the affidavit of the prisoner to prove that the witnesses from Cuba would be of any benefit to the prisoner, and as there was nothing in the affidavit to warrant him in adjourning the case until the May circuit, he would have to refuse the application. Coroner McPherson held an inquest today regarding the death of conductor Allingham. Several witnesses were examined, including all the train hands and a passenger on the ill-fated train. All testified to conductor Allingham being struck on the back of the head while passing under a bridge at Quispamsis station, while on top of his train. A brakeman was also on top, and saw the bridge passed under, and shouted to Allingham, but it was supposed he did not hear him. He was thrown beneath the wheels, yet he was immediately cut to pieces. The following verdict was brought in by the jury: ""That Samuel D. Allingham came to his death accidentally by being knocked off the top of his train by the bridge at Quispamsis station while passing under it, whereby several cars passed over his body."" The jury, while they exonerated the employees of said train from any blame in connection with the matter, think that the Government is open to censure for having bridges so low that the lives of the employees are endangered there. NOVA SCOTIA, Halifax, March 16. Besides 250 head of Nova Scotia cattle, the Caledonia, which sailed for Glasgow yesterday, took a large quantity of potatoes. Six cars of spices and six cars of sugar from Jamaica ex Beta, and 12 cars of sugar ex Bright Wapiti were shipped over the Intercolonial to Montreal yesterday.

Fatereon's second party of immigrants are not now expected to arrive here until tomorrow, being delayed by snow in Minnesota. The building of a temporary railway between Winnipeg and the Junction with the main line progresses very slowly on account of the frequent snowstorms. Last month only four miles of track were laid. A train with material became stuck in the snow yesterday when a short distance out, and a locomotive which was in the rear returned; since then the track has drifted over. Soft weather has now set in, and it is very doubtful whether it will be practicable to complete the track from here to Stoney Mountain in time to get the rolling stock and material there before the ice on the extensive intervening swamps becomes unsafe. In that case the proposed plan of building a permanent track southward to Winnipeg from the gravel pits at Stoney Mountain cannot be accomplished this season."

The Yankee writers who have been extolling the merits of Minnesota and Dakota and denouncing Manitoba as a God-forsaken country had their mouths effectually closed last week by the elements. A snowstorm of unparalleled severity raged throughout the length and breadth of those much-lauded districts, blocking up the railways, interrupting travel and stopping telegraphic communication; while in Manitoba an atmospheric serenity prevailed that can only be likened to the complacency of the Tory party as it sees the reaction set in as it has in Brome, Selkirk and those other political battlefields.

The Daily Telegraph says: Mr. Booth's labored accentuation showed itself in full force in Othello last night, and we feel ourselves occasionally distracted from the scene by this excess of preparation and constant pauses between each syllable. There was fine elocution in his speech, but no fire and no rapture. Though the audience was very frequently astonished into applause, it was never stirred into excitement or enthusiasm.

"18810126","J. Bray had at brief notice kindly consented to take his place. After alluding briefly to the reasons which had brought him forward, Mr. Bray said, ""I very sincerely regret the absence of Mr. White tonight, for I am sure that he would have done far more justice to this subject of Canada for Home than you can even expect at my hands. He would have spoken with clearer knowledge of the subject and a readier flow of eloquence than I can command. To add to my difficulties, I have been compelled to take the subject in hand at the very last hour. Only at midday did the request come that I should fill Mr. White's place at this board, and I complied, ladies and gentlemen, because I was anxious that the officers and members of this Society should not imagine that I cared more for my reputation or comfort than for their convenience, and I was sure that you would extend to me that generosity which has ever been denied to me by a true audience. It is to meet an emergency that I am here. It is to save you a deeper disappointment than that you may suffer by the absence of Mr. White, and I know that you will not expect much at my hands or my tongue tonight. I have been in Canada now about four years and a half, a very brief period in which to get to know a place and people; but, Mr. Chairman, I need not tell you that it is possible for one to learn a great deal of a country in four or five years. Enterprising book publishers form an integral part of a civilized community. I have called in the aid of the publisher so as to get an understanding of my neighbors and my neighborhood. It is a great story, not long, but very wonderful, this history of Canada. Just three hundred years ago this land was the hunting ground of the Indian, the wild Huron and the fierce Iroquois, whose history leads back into remote antiquity. Since when in 1534 Jacques Cartier passed through the Straits of Belle Isle, sailed up the Gulf of St. Lawrence, landed at Gaspe, and, erecting a cross surmounted with a fleur de lis, thus devoting the country to God and the King of France, what a change! European merchants have found here unlimited fields for adventure and commerce; European theologians, vexed with Star Chamber Inquisitions and limitations for the conscience and the heart, have found here that which they longed for: freedom to worship God. Anyone reading the history of Canada cannot fail to be struck with the fact that while its development has been comparatively slow, that while matters have not moved ahead with rushing and roaring as in some parts of this continent, the advance has been a real advance and not a mere experiment in nation-making. Caution is hardly a limit when great national issues are involved. A people cannot afford to make many mistakes, for they can never go back and do it over again. There has been a very steady process of consolidation going on; the far-off provinces have formed a great confederation, and it seems to me that it was well and wisely done, and will be maintained by the sound common sense of the people. There are a few complaints, of course, just as there always will be complaints until the millennium comes; but I am sure that the mass of the sober-minded electors will continue to understand that it is for the interest of Nova Scotia and British Columbia that they be linked together. Great waterways and great railways give cohesion and national unity to a widely scattered people. Now, Mr. Chairman, I think you and all here present will agree with me that we are today entering upon a new era in the life of this country and one that promises to be a period of great prosperity. A great deal of attention in Europe is being directed toward our shores; not only has a new world been opened up to us in the Northwest, but we are beginning to understand and appreciate the value of our possessions in Quebec and Ontario, and I think it is time we should change our attitude towards our country. I mean that we should begin to realize that it is our home, and is a place of which we are not at all ashamed. Too many of us when in Europe on travel register from America, as if we feared that to say Canada would involve the disagreeable necessity of having to pay for the room in advance. The pictures we send over are all of great snowstorms, where the poor struggling pedestrians look as if they found it difficult to keep a rag on their back. Now, why not send them over some of our summer and autumn pictures? And why not send them over a plan for building houses to keep the cold out? And why not tell them the truth about it: that there is no better climate in the world than the climate of Canada? A great deal is said everywhere about the terribly severe winters in Canada, and they shake their heads sadly when the English farmers are spoken of as coming here. What is the fact? Why, that Canadian farmers suffer far less discomfort in winter than do the English farmers. I can do more work in this climate than I ever could in any country of Europe; the atmosphere is crisp and bracing; it is in itself a stimulant. I believe that it is the healthiest country in the world for children. My own children improved amazingly on coming here, and wish now that they could be here again to frighten horses and break the shins of unwatchful pedestrians with their sleighs. Mr. Thos. Hughes made the statement that Canada is unhealthy, but he never vouchsafed to tell us where he got his information from. Unhealthy! Well, yes; it is. I will tell you to whom it is unhealthy. It doesn't agree with those who come here to live without working. They find that the cold at street corners is very intense, and they take the shivers and die; the best thing they could do, unless they can persuade themselves to work to keep the blood warm. And then, the climate does not agree with hard drinking, and those who get shipped from the old country because of their evil habits get made short work of here. We can make whiskey here warranted to kill at a reasonable period, if men will only take enough of it. But for men who work with hands or brain, for the industrious and sober, the climate is superb. Why, sir, here we are with the thermometer hanging peacefully around zero; the days are bright as a day in summer; the sky at night is a miracle of beauty; the stars seem to float in the infinite depths of space, while over in New York there is heard the hissing of many waters spouting from burst pipes. The hard-hearted plumber is unmoved by the plaints of women and the strong language of the sterner sex, poor men (the heads of households I mean, not the plumbers); they have had to flounder through a foot of slush in the streets, borne up only by the prospect of a warm room and a good meal at home, but they find only confusion worse confounded: the pipes burst, no dinner, and the plumber not to be found. What have they in England? Houses that invite the cold winter to enter and freeze everything freezable; now there is snow in the streets, but no sleighs in use; cities, the whole country, beaten down by a snowstorm. We are never in such straits. The snow makes roads for the farmer. He can cart his stuff then as he could not on the best of roads in summer, and as for us, well, for myself I know it is my great winter habit, my besetting sin. And then, let me say again, Mr. Chairman, that this is the home for the working man; he can have more personal comforts and a better return for his labor here than in any country in the world. Of course hard work must be put into the soil. Men cannot come here to sit down in idleness and expect a harvest; they must work for it. The trouble is that so many come here imagining that there will be no hardships to contend against. Sometimes farmers come expecting to find farms cleared and waiting for them, and they fancy that in a very short time they will be large landed proprietors. But that is a foolish dream. Can they do that in the Old Country? No; the farmer has to toil year in and year out to barely make a living. We say: You will have to toil here; only for your labor you will get a better return than you can get anywhere else. I think, Mr. Chairman, that we shall have a large immigration to this country during the next few years, and without in any way disparaging the United States, without for one moment depreciating their vast resources, still I venture to say that we shall have inducements to immigration which the United States do not possess. We can offer more variety for the choice of settlers. If they desire to remain near the seaboard we can give them splendid land in our own Province of Quebec. If they are afraid of the French element, which we who know it are not at all afraid of, they can go on into Ontario, where there are hundreds of thousands of magnificent farms possible, or they can go on into the great Northwest which is now being opened up by the building of one of the greatest railways in the world. And may I say that I reckon a great deal of having that variety of choice to offer. I believe that very many will prefer to remain in this Province, and we have plenty of room for them and a warm welcome. And I should like to tell you, gentlemen, that the Government of this Province is not averse to immigration; on the contrary, it is doing all it can to aid those who are trying to settle the lands held by the Crown Commission. Before long, we shall have thousands of industrious families settled on farms in our Eastern Townships. Now, sir, I am sure that we Canadians can fairly and honestly recommend our Government as a copy of the Government of Great Britain, the freest, the noblest Government in all the world. We have here responsible and constitutional government; we can adopt changes in the personnel or practices of Government just as readily and just as bloodlessly as the people of England. We are absolutely a free people; we have no old and useless institutions to maintain at enormous expense, as they have in the old world; if we want a change anywhere or in anything we are free to do it, so long as it is in the way of justice; we are not entangled and our affairs are not complicated by vested interests and legacies of feudalism. We have no State Church, but all the churches are free and equal; there are no great discrepancies which mark off class from class and man from man. I am glad that Burns sang the equal rights of men in Scotland; in Europe I am glad that he had the manly courage to look great aristocracies, great lords and nobles in the face, and assert the worth of manhood; but I am also glad that we need no such singer here; we know that a man's a man for a' that, and we pay respect, not to birth, but to worth; not to the accidental, but to character. That is a home worth having, I think, Mr. Chairman, and the story of it is a good one to tell in the old world ears. We can tell the peasants and small farmers of England that here low rent will purchase lands; by ordinary industry, they may secure at first a good living, and then property in farms. And they will be glad to hear it, for now they live from hand to mouth, at the mercy of landlords, hares and rabbits and other kinds of aristocratic game and a capricious climate, that one year will have a crop and the next wash it out of the soil. A good story to tell the Irish, standing in their despair of misery, asking for right to live on the land, or the privilege of lying in cold and quiet under the sod; we can tell them of our home, where there is room for them all, and they can obtain rights in the soil by fairly working for it, and where there is no oppressive landlordism and no insolence of caste; and a good story to tell the German, groaning under the pains and penalties of the army conscription. Here he can work and earn the fruits of his labor. We have no standing army to keep up at great cost; nobody wants to fight us, and we want to fight nobody. We boast only of our army of workers, and our officers of capital. Yes, a good story to tell for all, a true story, and I hope it will be well told, and that by the thousands and hundreds of thousands they will come: honest, industrious, god-fearing, liberty-loving people to help us in building up this nation, to share our privileges and burdens, that we may be peaceful and prosperous together in this Canada, our Home.

Their marriage was also turbulent, and a few days ago culminated in a separation. In the meantime husband No. 2 was placed in possession of facts that somewhat startled him. Correspondence with No. 1 convinced him that he was on the right track, and tonight Maud languishes in a cell at the Central Police Station."
"18810209","A II, Thompson state that the severe snowstorm this week has partly impeded traffic throughout the Kingdom, and so interrupted the usual course of business in the market that most of the public sales declared have been postponed. Bangor continues without alteration. Useful refining kinds are firm through the scarcity of West India. Beet is 3d to 8d per cwt dearer and a better inquiry prevails for refined. The first sale of Java coffee this year on account of the Netherlands Trading Company is fixed for the 28th instant, viz., 93,700 bags, and the entire quantity to be brought forward in 1881 does not appear likely to exceed 820,000 bags. Present estimate of the Government crop is about 652,000 bags, or rather more than half that of the previous year. Shipment of Brasil to Europe during the first six months of the season ending the 31st of December were about 31,000 tons in excess, and are likely to be further augmented owing to the abundant crops. The stock in America is, however, much reduced, which may affect the future distribution of supplies. In this market no change is perceptible. New crop plantation Ceylon has found steady buyers at the recent decline, and prices being still 15s to 20s per cwt lower excepting for fine bold than in January last, a more extensive trade may be anticipated. China tea remains without improvement, and quotations at the public sales are in some cases easier for common grades of congou. Indian has fully supported previous values. New Burmah rice meets with some demand at current low rates. The limited quantity of spices at today's public sales went off slowly, the market being very unsettled. THE FOREIGN GRAIN TRADE"

There will be a great increase in the production of lumber this year, nearly 50 percent over last year. Extensive gold mining operations are going on at Tangier, Shoal Harbour and other localities in Eastern Nova Scotia. One hundred thousand tons of Cape Breton coal have been contracted for in Montreal and points west for next season."
"18810312","A of Ktanley Street Presbyterian Church delivered his promised lecture on Up on last Thursday evening. Notwithstanding the heavy snowstorm, there was a good attendance, who for an hour listened with marked attention to a lecture replete with practical truths, plainly, forcibly and eloquently put. At the close, the company repaired to the lecture-room, where the pastor and his wife served tea and cake. About 20 minutes were spent in social intercourse, after which Rev. Mr. McCaul gave another forcible address on the subject of Personal Religion, and at the close about 15 young persons accepted the invitation of the pastor to meet once a week to sing spiritual songs and read some racy, heart-stirring articles on the subject of Personal Religion. The price of hogs in Chicago moved up 12 to 15c per 100 lbs to $5.27 to $5.75 for mixed packers. It appears that a large number of shorts, who went in upon the strength of the trichinias scare in Europe, have been caught napping. Strength continues to characterize Montreal provisions, Canada heavy moss pork being held firmly at $19.50, with sales transpiring all the time at both figures. Lard is strong at 13 to 13.5 per lb in pails. The stock of Canada lard is being rapidly reduced, and Chicago will shortly have to take its place. Smoked meats are moving slowly at about quotations, which are steady. The egg market was steadier, and prices were firm at 17c, some dealers asking 18c. Maple syrup was unquoted for at $11 to $15, in kegs and cans. Ashes were quiet at $4 to $4.05 for pots. PROVISIONS New pork, per brl, $10.00 to $10.50; hams, smoked, per lb; lard, in pails, per lb; bacon, per lb; tallow, rendered, per lb; tallow, rough, per lb; eggs, per dozen; ashes, not, per 100 lbs. In butter, there is very little business passing, even the local demand being complained of as disappointing. A few cases of rolls were placed today at 18 to 18.5 per lb, and one or two small lots of tubs at 10c. Twenty-two cents is about the top figure for fine jobbing selections of fall butter, and sales of creamery have been made in retail at 24 to 25c. New butter has been sold at 25c to grocers, but the quantity arriving is so small as to afford no criterion of value. The export trade is lively, and were stock to be crowded on the market, ridiculously low figures would have to be accepted. A lot of 60 packages of walters was offered today at 10c. The general feeling among holders here is in favor of carrying over stock until the opening of navigation, when it is hoped the usual demand from the lower ports will absorb all surplus that may then be left after local wants have been catered for. In New York, however, there appears to be a decline, and in fact, the situation on all old links is rather alarming. The market is dull; the only trading lines of interest are of choice white and half-white. The stocks held in this city have of late been well reduced, although they are still considerable. The bulk, however, consists of the best kinds of long keepers, upon which holders expect better prices. MONTREAL COW MARKET, March 11. There was a good demand for milch cows today, but the general run of stock was unsuited to the wants of the trade. Several of the best cows were purchased before reaching the market. A fine half-bred Ayrshire cow was sold to a private family for $57, and two good milkers were reported sold for $91. Louis Henault sold pretty good milkers for $45. Several other sales were reported on the market at $30 to $35 each, while a few common cows were purchased at from $22 to $25 each. The demand for this class, however, was small, but all good beasts met with a ready market at fair prices. Calves were in liberal supply, but good stock was scarce and wanted at from $1.50 to $3 each. Small calves, which were plentiful, sold slowly at $1.00 to $3 each. Three very fine spring lambs were sold today at $1.50 each. FARMER'S MARKET, Montreal, March 11. Owing to the storm, king's rule, the markets presented an almost deserted appearance, neither farmers nor dealers caring to venture out in any numbers in such a wild March snowstorm as took possession of Montreal and its vicinity today. Only a few straggling loads of oats were to be seen this morning at the lower end of Jacques Cartier Square, but the idea of a temporary scarcity did not seem to strike those who were offering them, as all they wanted was last Tuesday's figures, ranging from 83c to 90c per hog, one load being disposed of at 85c. The offerings of other kinds of grain were so small that prices were purely nominal. At House- coins, there was also a very small market, but prices were just about the same as previously quoted. The vegetable market was very quiet at unchanged rates. Potatoes were plentiful and prices ranged from 40 to 50 per bag. There was no activity of export account, although some dealers are anxiously waiting for it. Troll water-tress all the way from Boston was picked up at $1.80 per dozen bunches. Greenhouse rhubarb sold at $3.00 per dozen bunches. A lot of choice new print butter was retailed from the basket at the high price of 45c per lb, but the seller had no competitors. Ordinary prints brought old figures. Eggs were in fair supply at 21c to 22c per dozen. Farmers' dressed beef was in small supply, but the quality was very indifferent and prices did not exceed 5c per lb for hindquarters. About half a dozen dressed sheep were weighed off at $8.75 to $9.25 per 100 lbs. The fish market was quiet at former prices. The best line of eastern and Maine mackerel cannot be quoted at over 48c to 50c per lb. Australian, Montevideo, and other foreign have been in steady demand, and the stock of Australian has now become reduced to comparatively low figures. LIVE STOCK PRODUCE MARKET, Liverpool, Flour, Wheat Spring, Red Winter, White Winter, Club, Corn, Barley, Oats, Peas, Pork, Lard, Bacon, Beef, Tallow, Cheese."
"18810317","W. STEVEN0T, Beet Root Sugar The municipal council of Beauharnois has made an offer of $25,000 for the establishment of a beet root sugar factory. ASTRAT, The police have been informed that a six-year-old boy named Morris, residing with his parents on St. Denis street, is missing. The WEATHER To-day, at three o'clock this morning there seemed but little prospects of Vendor's prediction of a snowstorm being unfilled. Shaw & Gowuky will announce several important sales of household furniture for next month. Parties furnishing will please bear in mind. COMPLAINING Residents in the vicinity of the Gas Company's works in St. Anns Ward are complaining of the poisonous gas escaping from the sewers. Spring, The order given by the Chief of Police to clear the sidewalks has been pretty generally obeyed, and their appearance is a great improvement. The great sale of pianos and music still continues at A. K. Nordheimer. There are still some splendid pianos and first-class music to be disposed of at bargains. Philharmonic concert at the Queen's Hall to-night. The Richelieu Hotel is to have a new dining room. Aid McShane attended the meeting of the City Council yesterday. The St. Joseph Society will hold their annual procession this year, Seventeenth of Ireland. Great display of the dear little Shamrock. The ice railway is still in good condition; twenty cars passed over it yesterday. The Royal Scots and No. 5 company of the 85th paraded at the old City Hall last evening. Humpty Dumpty is the best show of the kind we have had for a long time. Matinee at the Royal this afternoon. At the last meeting of the St. Gabriel Council Mr. Chas. Willis was elected Councillor vice Mr. Clapp, resigned. Activity, however, is expected until the country roads are in a better condition and the wheels of commerce can revolve with greater freedom. We hear of complaints regarding remittance in some quarters, while in others they are reported fully as well as anticipated. In dry goods the situation is quiet. Up till to-day the arrival of buyers from the West has been disappointingly small, but there was more stir this afternoon owing to some of the missing ones dropping in and commencing business. Regarding iron and hardware, in heavy goods there has been quietness for a week or two, orders from the West having materially fallen off; indeed to send iron and some other goods west of Toronto is now no easy matter, the wholesale houses in the West showing a determination to have the business no matter at what cost. The time will probably come when they will have wished that they had allowed trade to flow in its natural channel. Shelf goods orders are coming to hand very freely. Most of the trade now are fully occupied in getting ready for shipment the long lists that have been coming in this month. Prices locally are unchanged; abroad and in the States, in iron, they are if anything a little off, making prices to-day what they were two months ago. The prospect for the future is bright and cheering; the present drawback is the narrow margin of profit on all goods. In pig iron there has been some activity for future delivery, sales of 100 to 500 tons having taken place for May and June delivery at a shade under our quotations. We now hear of some enquiry on American account. Stocks in store are moving off pretty freely in car lots, Huminerlee, Garlsherrie and Coltness being the chief brands dealt in at quotations. Huminerlee has been placed at $10, Garlsherrie at $16, and Coltness $20 to $20.25. Scotch Warrants are quoted by cable at 49. Bar iron is in fair demand for the season, but orders are mainly of a sorting up character, buyers holding off until the opening of navigation before laying in stock. Tin plates are in light demand notwithstanding the very low prices. The volume of business in small and disappointing. It is expected prices will advance when Americans come in for spring supplies. Present prices are very unsatisfactory, entailing great losses. In Canada plate there is continued dull market. Ingot copper is firm at 17c, and ingot tin is in fair request at 30 to 31. Advice from England report numerous failures in the usual trade, which are not to be wondered at, considering the unprecedented fluctuation in the price of both pig and manufactured iron. For instance, on January 1st, 1880, Canadian Merchant pig iron sold at $32, on January 12th, and on August 2nd, just over a month later, at $11, being a decline of $21 to top which is remarkable. In the wholesale grocery trade there is a general line of reports. In tea we hear the state of a stock of 4,500 half boxes of jam in New York on Montreal account, the last bulk being at $1. A small lot of tea has been sold at $1, at least as far as Japan, fetching from 37 cents. A small lot of tea has been sold at $1, at least as far as Japan, fetching from 37 cents.

"18810318","CRANO CELEBRATION OF ANNIVERSARY, IRELAND'S DAY IN THE ACADEMY GARDENS, The sons and daughters of Erin were astir early yesterday morning anxious to do fitting honor to Ireland's time-honored anniversary and the memory of the Patron Saint of the Green Isle. The enthusiasm with which the Irish people, wherever they may be, greet St. Patrick's Day, is proverbial and no national festival obtains so hearty a celebration as that which yesterday our Irish fellow citizens once more celebrated in this city with a display possibly surpassing that of any previous year. The weather, that all-important factor in the success or failure of an occasion of this kind, was in every way propitious, despite the gloomy prognostications of Mr. Vennor, whose threatened snowstorm happily was postponed. True, the roads were scarcely in a state to render walking a pleasure, but with a glorious sky overhead and the genial rays of a March sun, that little inconvenience was forgotten, and it is safe to say that none were deterred from taking part in the procession by so trivial a cause. The display of shamrocks was probably unprecedented, and on all sides was to be seen that cherished emblem of Erin, the dear little plant, so typical of the verdant shores of the fair isle of the sea, whose memory is the most precious legacy in the minds and hearts of Irish men and Irish women the world over. As early as seven o'clock in the morning, Craig Street and the adjoining streets in the vicinity of St. Patrick Church were the scene of bustle and life, men hurrying to the place of assembly, and little knots of persons joining in congratulations on the weather, and the generally favorable aspect of circumstances on this great day for Ireland, as more than one enthusiastic Hibernian termed it. The hour announced for the rendezvous was eight o'clock, and from that time until nine the crowd already gathered was continually reinforced by delegations from various societies, many in full regalia. Then, too, the bands, one after another, arrived and took up their positions, filling the air with the harmonies of Irish national song as they marched to their places. Soon the procession assumed signs of order, Mr. U Brien, the marshal-in-chief, aided by Mr. D. Murney and other assistants, supervising the task of placing the various societies and individuals. There were a number of handsome mounts, amongst whom we noticed our genial friend, Mr. Jim Cloran, grand-marshal for the St. Patrick Society, on Asmodeus, kindly loaned for the occasion by Mr. W."
"18810331","A Trowbridge of Rockport Miss Early was married in 1876 and is now Mrs. Simonds. She appeared in court with her husband and child. She is a refined and pleasant lady and quite well-known in her state. A shipment of lambs was wasted. New York, March 30 A cable dispatch states if the two weak-minded Swiss women who arrived yesterday be allowed to remain, hundreds of other worthless women will be sent here by the authorities from Switzerland and Southern Germany. Vennor's snowstorm Chicago, March 30 Mr. Vennor's closing snowstorm of the season arrived promptly on time at an early hour this morning. The snow is several inches deep and still falling rapidly at 10 o'clock and drifting badly. New York, March 30 Among the deaths announced today is that of M. Louis Cortambert, editor of the Mensager Franco-Americain, of pneumonia, aged 73. The break of the storm New York, March 30 The storm which threatened yesterday finally broke out in a copious rainfall at four o'clock this morning. The wind blew at the rate of 32 miles an hour at 7 a.m. and at 11 a.m. the force of wind was not less than 58 miles an hour. Heavy rains aided by high winds caused very high tides in the rivers; at some places the water was within the dock level and vessels lying in the slips seemed about to leave their moorings and sail into the lower streets of the city. The condition of the streets, especially around the neighborhood of the ferries, was wretched in the extreme. At Fulton ferry the streets were ankle deep. Inside the ferry houses the floors resembled lakes of dirty water. On the west side the high tide overflowed the docks in some places and passengers from Jersey found they had another river to cross. Many cellars on the south and west streets were flooded. Great damage has been done to shipping in the bay and telegraphic connection in many places has been interrupted. Along the Long Island coast the storm was very severe. A large schooner went ashore at Barren Island Point at 8:30 this morning. The sea was terribly rough. Two men were seen lashed to the rigging. A lifeboat from the station on Manhattan Beach was launched at nine o'clock and after a perilous trip succeeded in rescuing the men. The sea made a clean breach over the vessel. Bound boats all arrived on time and only experienced difficulty in making the passage through Hell Gate. Swiss emigrants New York, March 30 A cable from Bottozen, Switzerland, says: On January the 3rd the town council unanimously resolved that Mrs. Theresa Hansen and Friedlina Vogelin shall be sent to America if they are willing to go; if they don't consent, it is resolved that Theresa Hansen, above named, be placed in the House of Correction. On September the 9th, 1880, Friedlina Vogelin, illegitimate daughter of Christina Vogelin of this place, made a declaration which was inscribed on the minutes of the Church Council of Genggen, Canton of Argovie, that Gottfried Neir, her mother's husband, had sinfully lived with her till she left home. The President and town council admit openly having paid her passage to New York. Ingrates are indignant that they should be charged with sending an 'insane girl' to America but see no harm in sending there an abandoned woman of crime. Their opinion appears to be quite a common one in this canton. The two women above referred to are now at Castle Garden in charge of the matron, awaiting the action of the Board of Emigration. Several persons have already offered to employ them as domestics. The Department of Mat have asked to be apprised of the action of the Board of Emigration in regard to the persons mentioned. The Blab Washington, DC, March 30 The United States Supreme Court today found a decision in the case of Disk vs. The United States, which finally settles the question of the right of the President by and with the consent of the Senate to dismiss an army officer from the service without court-martial. Blabs was chaplain in the army and forwarded to the President a letter asking a temporary fit of loquacity which was granted and then appointed. President Harris said the affair of Blabs reminds him of a story. The addition of the report is that whatever may be taken of Blabs' behavior, the public sentiment is that he should not be dismissed. The opinion of another body is that he should be retained in the service. The Association for Portfolio As some of our readers have no doubt heard, the Art Association of Montreal has added to their already praiseworthy and welcome exertions for the furtherance of taste in art matters the enterprise of issuing a portfolio containing copies of some of the masterpieces that are or have lately been exhibited in their gallery. This portfolio consists of ten plates, the prints having been taken photomechanically at the establishment of Mr. George K. McSimrants in printers' ink from ordinary negatives. The paintings selected for reproduction by this method and for this purpose are the following: Scene at Murray Bay, from a sketch by Mr."

Chicago, April 1 Last night was one of the fiercest of the winter. It was very windy and cold, with miserable snow ten, and drifted fearfully. The same sort of weather continues today, it feels more like that of midwinter than April. April 1 A general snowstorm is reported in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Northern Michigan yesterday, accompanied by high winds. The snowstorm lasted here during the last day, continuing with all the rigor of a January blizzard. Nashville, April 1 The last bill passed a law declaring any abductor who attempts to take a person from his home and lynch him shall forfeit his office. It is for the remainder of the bonds authorized by the Funding Act of 1870 at the price which they will now bring; the expediency of borrowing money temporarily at a low rate of interest under the Act of June 1854, to redeem the maturing debt. After the conference I may have something to say. Advanced wage movement, New York, April 1 There was a general movement on the part of mechanics and laborers engaged in the building trades to obtain an advance of wages today, and as far as heard from all have been successful. The largest plumbing firms all acceded to the demand, advancing wages of journeymen from $3 to $3.50 a day. Robert L. Durnagh, who employs 800 bricklayers, and who is building the United Bank building, London and Globe Insurance Company building and Munroe's publishing house, advanced wages from $3 to $3.50, and other contractors have to do so, in order to complete their contracts. Advices from Brooklyn and New Jersey show that the bricklayers have nearly all obtained an advance of wages today. Nashville, Tenn, April 1 Five hundred negroes have left Huntington since Tuesday for Kansas; one thousand more will go in May. Heavy snowstorm prevailing here. Maimsox, Ind, April 1 Reliable information from Saluda township, this county, says large quantities of sulphur flour fell in a snowstorm last evening in that city. The same phenomenon was witnessed in this city. Washington, April 1 The President has added to appoint Captain Henry, of Ohio, United States Marshal, District of Columbia, in place of Frederick Douglass. Douglass will be appointed to some other equally good place. Somerset, Ky, April 1 William Bates, United States Marshal, was fatally stabbed on the outskirts of the town last night by an unknown man, who escaped. They had a quarrel in a saloon, and stepped outside to have it out in a square fight. Having gotten the best of his antagonist, the latter drew a bowie knife, and drove it up to the hilt in the Marshal's body. The blade entered the back, going clear through the body and coming out through the navel. Marshal Cooper, Bates' brother Marshal, was killed at precisely the same hour, a year ago, near the same place, almost exactly in the same way. The Early-Salary and Chicago, III, April 1 The jury in the suit of Alice A. Early for libel against Wilbur T. Story, returned a sealed verdict for plaintiff this morning, placing damages at $5. The suit was for $50,000. The fierce blow and ice carried away one hundred feet of Pike's pier, north of here, with 2,500 ties belonging to Albert Brothers, on Wednesday night. It is thought that the remainder of the pier, some 700 feet, has gone by this time. St. Louis, April 1 The very rules require that receipts have five days to run, and the first active market in which this five-day limit expires. While receipts for grain are coming in without extra storage, they cannot be delivered on regular sales after five days, deducting costs for every ten days, or part thereof, after five days from the date of report. Another snowstorm has again put us back, with no hope of commencing any farm work in Illinois for at least. I have had advices from Southern Illinois, Franklin County, March 28. The last week has made a great change in the winter wheat crop, which is damaged in several counties."

"18810413","DUOK SHOOTING IN CANADA (West -on and Water) The annual hunt was not without its challenges. Although the ground was somewhat slippery from a recent snowstorm, we left home on wheels and had some difficulty in getting down the hill that separates the residential part of Montreal from the Bonaventure station. We went on killing ducks, we took no luck with us, as most of the shooting is done in the marshy regions. We brought our guns and a good supply of No. 4 and 6 shot, together with a small portmanteau carrying all our camp furniture. We took our ticket to Homerstown station via the Grand Trunk Railway. Homerstown is a small village on the St. Lawrence, between the villages of Cornwall and Lancaster, and seventy-five miles above Montreal. I can carry when we arrived. A wagon was waiting for us, the usual vehicle in this country for use in the rural district, which will doubtless be familiar to many of our military and sporting men, having been taken by others. As the roads were bad, we went afoot, pacing the whole way to the river, a distance of three miles. We stopped at an inn on the bank, we were cordially received at Jackson Island by Mr. and Mrs. Aim and family, in part of whose village we proposed to take up our abode. The cabin is a wooden building, like most in the area."

He adds, and it has also this disadvantage, that Portland is a very small town, while New York is the largest in the United States This brings one to the business of the company, for the business of the routes of the company, as you will understand, must depend entirely upon their position Now, the business of the two roads, like that of any other two roads, is in one respect similar; that is to say, they are common carriers There is this great difference, that we occupy a much shorter and better road for traffic brought to us The Grand Trunk, from their exceptional position, as compared with the shorter routes, have to seek their traffic, and in the seeking of this traffic the Grand Trunk becomes more or less obnoxious to the rival corporations (Laughter) There is a nice little description of your property I am not going to refer to anything else in Colonel Grey's speech; but I thought it was a pity to withhold from you so charming a caricature of your property Now, what are the facts of the case? As I said at the beginning, we have a route from Detroit to Buffalo as well as they have; and, what is more, we have a better bridge at Buffalo, the International Bridge over the Niagara River, leading to their Southern ports; and in connection with the Erie Railway we have rather a shorter route than they have between Chicago and New York for these southern ports, which they claim as exclusively their own I do not like to boast, and I would not have said a word on the subject if we had not been so caricatured; but we have further by very much the shorter route from Chicago to Liverpool through our northern ports I should like just to remind you of the figures; I have given them at a previous meeting in 1891, and I quote from official statistics concurred in by the Postmaster-General of the United States Montreal is our summer port, and the distance between Chicago and Montreal was then 842 miles; it is now 817 by our Chicago & Grand Trunk line The distance between Montreal and Liverpool is 2,700 miles; making the total distance 1,482 miles between Chicago and Liverpool on our route by Montreal, which is the shortest route The next shortest route is our route by Portland to Liverpool Our line to Portland was 1,139; it is now 1,129; and from Portland to Liverpool the distance is 2,757 miles, making the total 3,881 miles Let us see what their short route is Taking Boston first, the distance from Chicago to Boston is 1,019 miles, and from Boston to Liverpool 3,080 miles, giving a total of 4,399 miles, against 3,381 miles by our line, the Boston route being 1,018 miles longer Now, let us look at the route by New York From Chicago to New York the distance is 1,021 miles, and from New York to Liverpool 3,083 miles, giving a total of 4,104 miles, against 3,581 miles by Montreal If you take away 90 miles of the whole railway route from Chicago to New York you then find the remaining distance from New York to Liverpool greater than our whole distance by Montreal from Chicago to Liverpool We have also as good a route to New York as they have, will now leave the Great Western I think I have said enough about them, but they have undertaken to compete with us through the means of the Toronto-Ottawa Railway, I think perhaps I ought to add one or two words on the subject of the line proposed between those points I dare say you may have seen something about it in the Canadian papers There has been for a long time a project for a railway between Toronto and Ottawa, and I have no doubt whatever that before long a line will be made connecting the two The point has been hinted at from time to time to be built, it would be a dreadful thing for the Grand Trunk Company, Mr. Chairman, if there should be a railway between Toronto and Ottawa that would connect with the line that has been built all along the route, all the traffic of that line to drain away I think it is a very bad prospect for the Grand Trunk Company, and the more I see of it the more I am inclined to think it is a very serious matter indeed I think it is a very serious matter indeed, and I will tell you why If there should be built a railway between

"18811022","SATURDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1881 GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY OF CANADA (From the Railway Notice) The proprietors of this company have met and heard all that could be said of a reliable and trustworthy character as to the position of their undertaking and its prospects as to the future. Of the past there was nothing that was unsatisfactory; of the future little that could be regarded as encouraging by those who believe that the prosperity of the undertaking is solely dependent upon the goodwill of American allies, or the interested movements of ""rings"" and combinations at Chicago and elsewhere in the manipulation of rates and stocks. The half-year that closed in June was described by Sir Henry Tyler as having been in many respects the worst which the company had ever experienced. The winter was of a severity which had been unequalled for the past forty years. Working expenses had been increased in consequence of the enhanced price of coal and the tax which the Dominion Government had most injudiciously levied on this, the prime necessity of locomotion and manufactures. The severity of the weather and the heavy snowstorms to which those experienced in this country, and of which railway directors and managers here have complained so bitterly, was a mere bagatelle had caused serious delays, and greatly increased the cost of clearing the tracks and moving the trains. The cost of materials had increased and wages had advanced. Yet, in the face of all these discouraging circumstances, the company had earned more money than in any previous June half-year of its existence, and, with one or two exceptions, more even than in the December half of any year. The result was wholly without precedent in the company's history, and the proprietors very cordially passed the resolution ordering the payment of the full 5 per cent dividend on the first as well as the second preferences of the company. To appreciate the full significance of this result, it should be borne in mind that these stocks, now taking the full dividend, had been doubled in their nominal amount by the impolitic action of bygone times, when ten years of unearned dividends were piled on the existing amount of preference stocks. It is not a bad augury for the future of a concern that, in the worst half-year ever experienced, the earnings should be sufficient to pay the full dividends upon a preference capital the nominal amount of which is twice that represented by the original bonds. At the present time the business of the Grand Trunk, as of other American lines, is deranged by a ""war of rates,"" as the competition of the American trunk lines is termed, by which, according to Mr. Garrett, the President of the Baltimore & Ohio, a loss of two million has been sustained by the trunk companies in two months. When this competition will cease no one can tell, and it is idle to speculate upon the course which presidents and managers of American railways, having their own policy to serve rather than the interests of the shareholders, may take in the matter. Upon this point of the policy and aims of Vanderbilt and other American railroad magnates curious rumors are already afloat. Of course whatever affects adversely the interests of the American trunk lines must to some extent also operate against the Grand Trunk Railway. But this company, like the New York Central, has other sources of business than that which consists in the carriage of grain from Chicago to New York. It has, as was pointed out by the chairman, a very direct route between Boston and the New England States and the Northwest, and it has, under the present state of affairs, developed a large amount of passenger traffic on that route. In former times the fare between Boston and Chicago was $19; now, thanks to the policy of unrestricted competition in railway business, which is not, however, permitted to be applied to any other branch of industry in the States, the fare is $5, and the Grand Trunk compensates themselves for a partial reduction in the grain rates by a large, and, strange as the fact may seem, a profitable amount of east and west passenger traffic. The judicious policy of securing control of the line to Chicago enables the Grand Trunk to make itself felt as a power among the railways of America. If, in the far-reaching designs of Mr. Vanderbilt, it should be considered desirable, for instance, to order the Chicago trains of the Erie from off the Lake Shore line, the Grand Trunk can, by its International Bridge at Buffalo, provide the Erie with a second route to Chicago. If the Central and Erie combine to refuse the Trunk traffic at Buffalo, there are, as Sir Henry Tyler hinted at the meeting, some combinations which will give to the Grand Trunk a route to New York independent of either of those companies. Westward, too, there are some alliances, which need not be more particularly specified at the present time, which will secure traffic from the Northwest irrespective of any companies which are controlled in the interests of present active competitors of the Grand Trunk. Apart, however, from the securities which, sooner or later, will be obtained for its due share of the east and west-bound traffic, the Grand Trunk possesses within its own territory proper, viz., the Dominion of Canada, an enormous amount of rapidly increasing local traffic. The statistics given by Sir Henry Tyler on this head are highly encouraging. The proportion of local to through traffic is every year increasing with great rapidity. In 1880 the proportion was 38 of local to 62 of through traffic. The proportion of local to through traffic is now, however, 42 and 58 respectively. The earning capacity of the road, as was pointed out at the meeting, has very greatly increased. The engines are more powerful, the trains are longer, the cars take average loads of seven and a half tons, against averages of about half that weight in former years. Such is the general improvement which has been established that, with an addition to rates of a very moderate amount, and such as would not be sufficient to interfere with the increase of business, the working expenses may be reduced to 60 per cent, or some 8 per cent lower than the charge for working in the last half year. As it is impossible to say when it may suit the purposes of the railway managers in New York to cease their competition, Sir Henry Tyler very wisely declined to give any opinion on the subject. It is sufficient to say that his colleagues and himself and the executive in Canada repeat the statement, made on many previous occasions, that they are perfectly ready at any time to accept and, what is more, scrupulously adhere to any decision which the board of arbitrators appointed by the companies may decide as to the rates in the future. Pending this, the company are prepared to hold their own against all competitors, and, strong in their position, an excellent and well-equipped road, an active and experienced executive in Canada, an unassailable financial condition, and a credit equal to that of the American lines, they can afford to await results with perfect confidence as to the future of the undertaking. The prefatory remarks of Sir Henry Tyler with reference to the loss which the United States had sustained by the death of President Garfield were appropriate and well-timed, and the tribute to his untarnished probity and great abilities was cordially approved by the meeting. It needed no formal resolution to place on record the feelings of the proprietors of the Grand Trunk Railway. The hearty and spontaneous applause was a sufficient demonstration of their sympathy with the few well-chosen and eloquent observations of their chairman."

LOSS OF THE ONTARIO AND HER CREW The Ontario, a Cape Breton coal-carrying vessel of 200 tons capacity, commanded by Captain McCauley, left St. Johns on Tuesday last, bound for Cow Bay. During the terrific gale of Thursday last, a heavy snowstorm driving on the land at the time and intensifying the darkness, the unfortunate vessel was flung on the reefs a few miles to the eastward of Chapeau Rouge and almost instantaneously dashed to pieces. The captain, officers, and all but one of the crew perished. The steward, a young German named Thor Michaelson, escaped. A wave flung the young sailor high up a precipitous cliff and landed him on shore. It was about ten o'clock at night when the vessel was driven headlong among the rocks and breakers, and when morning and consciousness dawned upon Michaelson he found himself landed nearly two hundred feet above the boiling water. When Michaelson looked down on the scene below nothing but raging sea foam was visible. Not a plank or spar, not a solitary memento of the ill-starred Ontario met his gaze. The snowstorm was over. Within a few miles from where he stood was the little hamlet of St. Lawrence. Thither he bent his steps and reached the nearest house contiguous to the road after some three hours' traveling. Weary and sick, the poor fellow was tenderly cared for, fed and clothed and sent down to St. Johns by the mail steamer, thence to pass into the care of the German Consul, who will provide him with a passage to his home."

The above teams, shortly after 3 o'clock, met on the football field for the second time this autumn. Saturday morning gave promise of a better afternoon than that which followed it, although as compared with the last six Saturdays it was very favorable to football. The slight snowstorm at the beginning of the match, which numbed the hands, passed unnoticed as the players' spirits as well as their bodies warmed up with the struggle. Graham kicked off for Montreal, who, having lost the toss, played down toward St. Catherine street. It went to S. Blacklock, who was quickly tackled by Stirling within ten yards of the goal line. A scrimmage was formed and the ball snapped back into the goal line, where the Britannias roughed it. It was then kicked off at 5 yards and was soon being picked up near the Britannia goal and scrimmaged. The Britannias soon worked it up towards the center and a long kick drove it to the Montreal end where it crossed the goal line but was again sent down the field, without being roughed, by Haythorne in a nice drop. An equal war was waged for some time about center field when the leather was sent to the east corner of the Britannia end, and being returned by a kick, found a temporary resting place in Sorley's hands, who secured a free kick. He then placed it for Heneker who made a beautiful place kick which the referee decided was not a goal. Play continued, the Britannia running the ball out. After a few minutes, Blacklock broke away from a scrimmage kicking the ball in front of him, and suddenly picked it up when pretty close to the Montreal goal line. He fell after being tackled and the Montrealers contended that he had the ball in front of him, and Kinghorn following, rushed past the goal line and touched it down. The question was submitted for decision to the umpires and referee, who were bothered by the inroads of anxious inquirers. After some time it was given to Montreal, who strongly protested against the decision. Play then went on and after a few minutes, without points being taken, time was called. SECOND THIRTY-QUARTER, Without a moment's intermission the sides fed about and went to it again. There was such hard tackling and the teams were so evenly matched that there was no scope for individual play; no sooner would a man get the ball and attempt to start off in a canter than he would find himself prostrate with one man on his head, another perhaps on his back, and a third holding his leg in case he was insufficiently anchored. One moment would see the ball within a few feet of the Montreal goal line, the next a few feet from that of the Britannias. The play was as even as it possibly could be. Towards the end of the game the backers of each side displayed the utmost enthusiasm, shouting the name of their favorite club for several minutes at a stretch, and encouraging the players by every possible means. Guerrier got a very heavy fall, which caused him to retire from the field. At first the Britannias expressed their willingness to have him replaced, but subsequently they withdrew their consent. On hearing of this, Guerrier, game to the last, reappeared on the field, and played on till the end. It is said the match was one of the best ever played in Montreal. There was very little individual play, but also very little that was loose. For the Montrealers, Abbott and Campbell were conspicuous for some good runs, and the former for good kicking as well. Guerrier and Fred Cains played a very quick game as quarter-backs, the former, with his short quick rushes, and the latter with his peculiar revolving way of getting through a crowd. Haythorne did a couple of very effective pieces of kicking, and Heneker deserves mention for his close try at goal. Thus, scrimmage men on both sides hammered away at each other like so many battering-rams, with alternate success. Walker's footwork did good execution while Stirling and H. Campbell were well on the ball. In fact, nearly every man on both sides worked hard and well. For the Britannias, the best play by far was shown by Hamilton, whose coolness and splendid kicking saved many a touch down. He did nearly the whole of the defense play for his team, and did it well. P. Campbell's tackling and Aroton's running deserve mention."

Much surprise is felt at the semi-official announcement that the Cabinet will not meet again this year, owing to the condition of affairs in Ireland. It has been found necessary to raise subscriptions for many women and children left utterly destitute by non-payment of rent. One association, headed by the Archbishops of York and Dublin, is collecting funds in England, and other bodies are appealing for funds enough to give these reduced families at least a good Christmas dinner. The number of outrages is steadily increasing, and although the sub-commissioners of the Land Court are certainly doing their best to make the Land Act popular, a large section of the people prefers to adhere to the no-rent programme and to set up again, under cover of White-Boyism, the rule of intimidation and lawlessness established by the League. Under such circumstances, the decision of the ministry to hold no more cabinet meetings is regarded with amazement. Mr. Gladstone, who is now in the best of health and spirits, is said to be perfectly satisfied that Mr. Forster can deal with the ferment in Ireland without the assistance of his colleagues.

The Herald's London special says: The latest intelligence from Aberdeen respecting the grave robbery states that three persons' footmarks have been traced, but it is believed there must be more than that number concerned in the removal of the Earl's remains from Lmneecht, if not in the actual theft of the body from the vault. Inquiries have been made of railway officials, who say they have no trace of any package which would be likely to contain a human body. The present Earl and others of the family have from time to time received a number of anonymous letters, stating that the late Earl's body had been removed, but no notice was taken, as it was not thought that the writers were serious. The vault is now guarded by a strong force of police, every precaution being taken against the entrance of any unauthorized person. A laborer in the locality has been arrested, and the Sheriff and Procurator Fiscal have gone to make the necessary investigations. The man's boots correspond with the footprints found near the tomb, casts of which have been taken. It seems more than probable that the removal of the body must have taken place months ago. The coffin, when found, was rifled of its contents and covered with dust and mildew. Dust which had fallen from the saw employed to cut open the coffin was hidden by longoid growth. The edges of the cut leaden shell were not bright, as they would have been if the depredations had been newly committed, but were dull and blackened by lapse of time. Lord Crawford has placed the matter in the hands of his London solicitors, who have been in communication with the Home Office and with Scotland Yard on the subject. All sorts of theories are current as to the theft. It is even asserted that the body never actually reached the country. It is suggested that the thieves are from Florence, where the body was embalmed. The dowager Countess and family are at Dunecht, and the present Earl arrived from the Continent yesterday. The papers recall many singular circumstances connected with the body of the late Earl, which met with curious misfortunes on the way to its last resting place. In the first place, there was immense difficulty in transporting it across the Alps; then there was a violent gale in running the Channel, and the coffin had to be lashed on deck; then at Aberdeen no hearse was found large enough for it, and the outer shell had to be removed; lastly, on the day of removal from Aberdeen to Dunecht, in one of the most violent snowstorms ever known, the hearse was snowed up on the journey for several days.

"18811209","A nation to which we were so nearly allied by kindred ties and by common aims. A nation which we had admired so much in its race for freedom, and in its development and material prosperity. It was not his purpose, nor perhaps would it be fitting, considering the great calamity under which that nation has recently staggered, to enter upon any discussion relating to the political or national affinity which might be supposed to exist between the kindred countries. They had felt like the Americans had felt the great sorrow that they have staggered under. Their great misfortune was almost as much a British as an American calamity and it was with pride that they had seen how the Queen, by her example and sympathy, had stood alongside that lady in America and mingled her tears with Mrs. Garfield's in the common grief for the great calamity which had befallen her. (Applause) There might be those who, considering the calamity by which the present occupant of the presidential chair has risen to that position, might think that they should rather preserve a silence in our tributes, but the President of the United States is still representative of that great country, and he (the speaker) was sure they will all join with him when he said ""God bless Chester Arthur."" (Cheers) The band having played the ""Star Spangled Banner,"" Consul-General Smith said that in one respect he supposed they were all republicans. They were all loyal and devoted citizens of the greatest of all republics, that of letters. (Applause) Literature was recorded and published thought, and the man who contributed most to literature contributed most to the world's choicest and richest possessions. Of all forms of hero worship none was so enduring and none so worthy as that of the literateur. The author of the best books was sure in the long run to be regarded as the greatest hero, and the most deserving of our respect. All other forms of human achievements were disposed to melt and moulder away, but thought lived in perpetual growth, it is ""Tully's verse and Virgil's lay, and Livy's pictured page. This shall in the resurrection be. All else immune decay."" (Applause) They had met there that evening to become acquainted with one who had become known to them as one of the most profound philosophers (hear, hear) as well as one of the most exact and truthful historians of any age. (Laughter) This was the first time their guest had visited Canada, but it was about time he commenced to study one of the most interesting branches of his knowledge. (Hear, hear) The province of Quebec, in his (Mr. Smith's) judgment, was the most interesting part of the North American continent. (Applause) It was full of poetry, of imagination, and of all that was fascinating to the imagination and the fancy. After alluding to the presence of the Canadian poet, Mr. L. Frechette, Mr. Smith thanked the assembly for the manner in which the toast of the President of the United States had been received. (Cheers) The Chairman in proposing the toast of the evening said he did not intend standing in the way of the very great treat that was in store for them. The toast he was about to propose was one of such importance, at least in the literary world, as they were not in the habit of drinking to, and he would ask them for a bumper. They were past the age when it used to be said with a good deal of empressement that nobody ever read an American book. That was no doubt said at a time when in the New World people came out to fight the wilderness. They had not then much time for intellectual culture, and they did not devote a great deal of attention to literature. No doubt such writers as did write in those days modeled their views after the ways of the politicians and satirists of the Old World. But as the new country developed, as its characteristics became marked, there grew up an original American literature which commanded the respect of scholars everywhere and of mankind throughout the world (cheers). But there was no branch of this literature more distinct or peculiar than that quaint humor which had grown up in America, and whose master they had the honor to recognize that night as their guest. (Cheers) Mark Twain required no compliments, but he did not think he would go too far when he said that he was the foremost man in the school of humor to which he referred. (Hear, hear) He might go further and say no school of humor had done so much to enrich American literature and attract the attention of the world. (Cheers) The toast having been drunk with great enthusiasm with musical honors, Mr. Fubuhuth read the following poem composed for the occasion: Allan's muse, cinq strophes à l'hôte illustre, pour les présents. C'est le plus grand des philosophes, puisqu'il est le plus humain. Chante, l'on ne saurait trop dire à la louange de celui qui, de son temps, mit, bon dire, en le faisant rire avec lui. Rire est le secret du bien-être. Mais tous parlent de l'univers, on va bientôt disparaître, les malheureux et les pervers. Le rire est un divin délice, bruyant, doux ou moqueur, l'homme aime chez la femme. C'est l'écho le plus vrai du cœur. Fêtons-le donc dans la personne de Twain, notre noble invité, et décernons-lui une couronne au grand prêtre de la gaîté, celui dont la plume s'épanouit dans un si brillant unisson, la plus fine verve gaillarde avec le vrai Anglo-saxon, LOUIS FRECHETTE. When the guest of the evening rose to respond to the toast, he was received with a deafening applause. The assemblage rose en masse, and waving their pocket handkerchiefs echoed and re-echoed their first greeting. Mark Twain spoke as follows: That a banquet should be given to me in this ostensibly foreign land and in this great city, and that my turn should be graced by such complimentary words from such distinguished lips, are eminent surprises to me; and I will not conceal the fact that they are also deeply gratifying. I thank you, one and all, gentlemen, for these marks of favor and friendliness; and even if I have not really or sufficiently deserved them, I assure you that I do not any the less keenly enjoy and esteem them on that account. When a stranger appears abruptly in a country, with any apparent business there, and at an unusual season of the year, the judicious thing for him to do is to explain. This seems peculiarly necessary in my case, on account of a series of unfortunate happenings here, which followed my arrival, and which I suppose the public have felt compelled to connect with that circumstance. I would most gladly explain if I could; but I have nothing for my defense but my bare word; so I simply declare, in all sincerity, and with my hand on my heart, that I never heard of that diamond robbery till I saw it in the morning paper; and I can say with perfect truth that I never saw that box of dynamite till the police came to inquire of me if I had any more of it. These are mere assertions, I grant you, but they come from the lips of one who was never known to utter an untruth, except for practice, and who certainly would not so stultify the traditions of an upright life as to utter one now, in a strange land, and in such presence as this, when there is nothing to be gained by it, and no practice needed. I brought with me to this city a friend, a Boston publisher—but, alas, even this does not sufficiently explain these sinister mysteries; if I had brought a Toronto publisher along, the case would have been different. But no, possibly not! The burglar took the diamond studs, but left the shirt; only a reformed Toronto publisher would have left the shirt. To continue my explanation, I did not come to Canada to commit crime this time but to prevent it. I came here to place myself under the protection of the Canadian law and secure a copyright. I have complied with the requirements of the law; I have followed the instructions of some of the best legal minds in the city, including my own, and so my errand is accomplished, at least so far as any exertions of mine can aid that accomplishment. This is rather a cumbersome way to fence and fortify one's property against the literary line, cancer, it is true; still, if it is effective, it is a great advance upon past conditions, and one to be correspondingly welcomed. It makes one hope and believe that a day will come when, in the eye of the law, literary property will be as sacred as whiskey, or any other of the necessaries of life. In this age of ours, if you steal another man's label to advertise your own brand of whiskey with, you will be heavily fined and otherwise punished for violating that trade-mark; if you steal the whiskey without the trade-mark, you go to jail; but if you could prove that the whiskey was literature, you could take them both, and the law wouldn't say a word. It grieves me to think how far more profound and reverent a respect the law would have for literature if a body could only get drunk on it. Still the world moves: the interests of literature upon our continent are improving; let us be content, and wait. We have with us here a fellow craftsman, born on our own side of the Atlantic, who has created an epoch in this continent's literary history, an author who has earned, and worthily earned and received, the vast distinction of being crowned by the Academy of France. This is honor and achievement enough for the cause and the craft, for one decade assuredly. If one may have the privilege of throwing in a personal impression or two, I may remark that my stay in Montreal and Quebec has been exceedingly pleasant, but the weather has been a good deal of a disappointment. Canada has a reputation for magnificent winter weather, and has a prophet who is bound by every sentiment of honor and duty to furnish it; but the result, this time, has been a mess of characterless weather, which all right-feeling Canadians are probably ashamed of. Still, only the country is to blame; nobody has a right to blame the prophet, for this wasn't the kind of weather he promised. Well, never mind; what you lack in weather you make up in the means of grace. This is the first time I was ever in a city where you couldn't throw a brick without breaking a church window. Yet I was told that you were going to build one more. I said, the scheme is good, but where are you going to find room? They said, we will build it on top of another church and use an elevator. This shows that the gift of lying is not yet dead in the land. I suppose one must come in the summer to get the advantage of the Canadian scenery. A cabman drove me two miles up a perpendicular hill, in a sleigh, and showed me an admirable snowstorm from the heights of Quebec. The man was an ass; I could have seen the snowstorm as well from the hotel window and saved my money. Still, I may have been the ass myself; there is no telling; the thing is all mixed up in my mind; but anyway there was an ass in the party; and I do suppose that wherever a mercenary cabman and a gifted literary character are gathered together for business, there is bound to be an ass in the combination somewhere. It has always been so in my experience; and I have usually been elected, too. But it is no matter; I would rather be an ass than a cabman, any time, except in summer; then, with my advantages, I could be both. I saw the Plains of Abraham, and the spot where the lamented Wolfe stood when he made the memorable remark that he would rather be the author of Gray's Elegy than take Quebec. But why did he say so rash a thing? It was because he supposed there was going to be international copyright; otherwise there would be no money in it. I was also shown the spot where Sir William Phipps stood when he said he would rather take a walk than take two Quebecs. And he took the walk. I have looked with emotion, here in your city, upon the monument which makes forever memorable the spot where Lord Nelson did not stand when he fell. I have seen the cab which Champlain employed when he arrived overland at Quebec; I have seen the horse which Jacques Cartier rode when he discovered Montreal. I have used them both; I will never do it again. Yes, I have seen all the historical places; the localities have been pointed out to me where the scenery is warehoused for the season; my sojourn has been to my moral and intellectual profit; I have behaved with propriety and discretion; I have meddled nowhere but in the election. But I am used to voting, for I live in a town where, if you may judge by the local prints, there are only two conspicuous industries: committing burglaries and holding elections, and I like to keep my hand in, so I voted a good deal here. Where so many of the guests are French, the propriety will be recognized of my making a portion of my speech in the beautiful language, in order that I may be partly understood. I speak French with timidity, and not flowingly except when excited. When using that language I have often noticed that I have hardly ever been mistaken for a Frenchman, except, perhaps, by horses; never, I believe, by people. I had hoped that mere French construction with English words would answer, but this is not the case. I tried it at a gentleman's house in Quebec, and it would not work. The maid servant asked, What would Monsieur? I said ""Monsieur,"" and ""Sir, is he with himself?"" She did not understand. I said that he did not seem to be at home. She did not understand that; I don't know why, but she didn’t, and she lost her temper besides. Somebody in the rear called out, Qui est donc là? or words to that effect. She said, C'est un fou, and shut the door on me. Perhaps she was right; but how did she ever find that out? for she had never seen me before till that moment. But, as I have already intimated, I will close this oration with a few sentiments in the French language. I have not ornamented them; I have not burdened them with flowers of rhetoric, for, to my mind, that literature is best and most enduring which is characterized by a noble simplicity. J'ai le belle bouton d'or de mon oncle, mais je n'ai pas celui du charpentier. Si vous avez le fromage du brave monsieur, c'est bon; mais, si vous ne l'avez pas, ne vous désolez pas, prenez le chapeau de drap noir de son beau-frère malade. Tout à l'heure! Savoir faire! Qu'est-ce que vous dit le pâté de fois gras? Revenons à nos moutons! Pardon, messieurs, pardonnez-moi; essayer à parler la belle langue d'Ollendorff strains me more than you can possibly imagine. But I mean well, and I've done the best I could. (Loud and continued laughter and applause) The Chairman next proposed the toast of ""American Literature,"" and coupled with it the names of Rev."

The Orange circular, London, December 9, The Earl of Kenmare has discharged all his employees and intends to leave Ireland for the present, on account of non-payment of rents. A battalion of the Fifty-sixth Foot has been ordered to Ireland. The Times admits that the suggestion for removing to England for trial persons under indictment for murder in Ireland is open to the objection that it is almost as difficult to get evidence as verdicts. The idea of removal was strongly condemned by the Liberal papers when mooted some time ago. The Manchester Guardian's London correspondent says: It is believed that the Right Hon. Hugh Law, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, fully shares the objection of the Irish judges to the suspension of the jury system. Dublin, December 10, Bishop McNulty, of Meath, publishes a letter declaring that if the Radical party does not compel Gladstone to reverse his policy and release the suspects, he must decide to renounce Irish support. A despatch to the Times from Dublin says: The Land Commissioners have shown by their treatment of the first applications submitted to them for abrogating leases that they will not encourage any speculative attempts to take undue advantage of the extraordinary powers given in the Land Act. At the Cork assizes, in impaneling the jury, thirty-five persons were ordered to stand down, the Crown Counsel stating that this course was adopted because it was presumed they were prepared to violate their oaths. The Times says that Sir Samuel Wilson, in accordance with the advice of his counsel, will at once lodge a petition against Mr. Porter, the successful candidate in the Londonderry election. Cork, December 10, Two prominent members of the Land League have been arrested here. The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland has issued a circular condemning the Land League and stating that in the United Kingdom and colonies there are thousands and thousands of Orangemen ready to fight for the constitution. Inflammatory placards posted in Dublin and the suburbs, headed ""no rent,"" have been torn down by the police. Dublin, December 10, Mr. Piggott has written a letter denying Mr. Egan's charges that he tried to extort a loan by threatening to publish a statement relative to the alleged misuse of the League's fund. He maintains that it was the League which offered him £500 to publish false accounts. He comments severely on Egan's conduct, and declares that the no-rent cry is an injury to Ireland and a libel on Irish patriotism. THE ATLANTIC CYCLONE! Dangerous passage of the Hibernian and loss of her boats. Fears for the safety of a ship and a straining. St. John's, Nfld, December 9, After a tempestuous voyage of sixteen days and a half the Allan mail steamer Hibernian arrived at this port at 11 o'clock last night. Captain Wylie spoke of this western passage as the most boisterous within the whole range of his experience. On Saturday last a terrific sea swept over the steamer's bow rising as high as the foreyard, and unfortunately, swept Mr. Owens, the boatswain, overboard. Another mountain wave broke on board and literally tore up from its iron fastenings in the deck the huge forward steam winch. One of the long lifeboats was wrenched out of the davits and hurled into the sea, a portion of the bow rail was carried away, and for several hours the helmsmen were steering the ship immersed to their middle in the water. During one twenty-four hours of the voyage the Hibernian was driven back sixty miles to the eastward, and another day's log shows a loss of thirty miles. The storm was semi-cyclonic, traveling uniformly from southwest to northwest and then oscillating back. Captain Wylie speaks in glowing terms of the handsome behavior of his ship, swept by sea and storm during sixteen trying days. The passengers and ship's company are all well. ANOTHER STORM TO BE MET, Scarcely had the Hibernian been fastened to her moorings in the harbor last night when a hurricane from the westward began to rise with alarming fury, blowing violently all night, and the gale is still increasing. Vessels are driving from their moorings in the harbor, and require the assistance of steam tugs to lay out additional cables. The bay of St. John's, as I am cabling, is in perfect white foam of sea drift, and sheets of white spray resembling a snowstorm are constantly swept upward from the surface of the sea and flying with lightning velocity through the air. Grave apprehensions are entertained for the safety of the returning Favorite, of St. John's. She left Catalina at nine o'clock on the morning of last Thursday week, with the L.B. Jo'ase, a large sailing ship, in tow, bound for Bell's Cove, in Notre Dame Bay. The following day there was a furious gale of wind from the northwest so violent that the Cunard steamer Marathon with difficulty passed through the narrows of St. John's. Since then no word has been received of either the steamer or the ship, although there is telegraphic communication with immediate harbors."

"18820123","N. Co. Qdeiiko, January 22, Colonel Vohl has telegraphed from Calumet that all is quiet at that place, and that he himself and all the men with him are quite well. An escape of gas occurred opposite the residence of Mr. Celostin Talliere, St. Yalier street. The fluid penetrated by the cellar into the house, which had to be abandoned. The Gub Company warned the occupants not to enter with lights for fear of an explosion. In the morning a dog, which had been left in the house, was found asphyxiated. Four sleighs, driven by Isadora Chusse, Joseph Bottulieu, Komi Michaud, and George Marquis, crossed a day or two ago the ice bridge which separates Isle Verte from the south shore. These men were all habitants, residing upon the Island, and were accompanied by their wives. When almost across the bridge the ice gave way under the first sleigh, and in a moment it was in the water, together with the horse drawing it. Madame Chusse and Madame Beauliou, who occupied the cariole, were thrown into the river, together with a little boy four years of age, and their friends were nearly distracted to see them struggling in the water amid the broken ice. Mr. Chasse happened to be on rotten ice, which gave way under him just as the second sleigh, driven by Mr. Beaulieu, came up. The child was saved, with great difficulty, just as it was on the point of disappearing. A few minutes later and the two women were also safe. Mr. Chasse and the horse were saved with difficulty. The wet and half-frozen party were conveyed to the residence of Mr. Prudent Chasse, where their wants were attended to. Fortunately, they are reported to be none the worse for their temporary immersion. The wife of Constable Falardeau complained to the Deputy Chief of Police that her husband was in the habit of drinking very hard and abusing her. She alleged that she was even then afraid to remain in the house with him in consequence of his revolver being within his reach. The Deputy Chief sent two men of the force to his house to bring up his revolver and belt to the station. Owing to the condition in which they found him, they took him also to the station and lodged him in one of the cells. Falardeau is a smart, clever policeman, his trouble being entirely due to his fondness for liquor. He was formerly a sergeant but was reduced. He was for some time with the late Major Yoyer in the 100th Regiment, and is regarded by his comrades of the police and superior officers as one of the pluckiest men on the force. He has a family of six small children. The snowstorm which set in last night has continued all day; about a foot of snow has fallen, blocking up all the roads. To-night the wind is quite high, but not very cold. The French papers are demanding a new Court House here.

"18820127","U, January 20 The case of J. Henry Phair and William II Venning was before the Circuit Court at Fredericton on Tuesday. This action was brought to recover damages for the seizure of the rods and lines of the plaintiff, who was fishing on his own land on the Miramichi. The defendant, who is the Inspector of Fisheries for New Brunswick, acted under an Order-in-Council made at Ottawa on the 11th of 1879, which is as follows: Fishing for salmon in the Dominion of Canada excepting under the authority of leases or licenses from the Department of Marine and Fisheries, is prohibited. Phair refused to give up his fishing rod to the officer, and only yielded when the latter presented a pistol. At the close of the plaintiff's case, Mr. Burbidge moved for a non-suit, on two grounds: first, that the defendant was acting in the capacity of a justice of the peace, and was entitled to one month's notice of action; and second, that the plaintiff was illegally fishing. The Judge overruled both these objections, and charged favorably to the plaintiff on the law points, but strongly against him on the question of damages. The jury awarded fall. News was received here today that Geo. H. Lindsay, Mayor of Stephen, died this morning. It is only three or four months since Mr. Lindsay was left a widower.

Hon Mr. Carou entertained the members of the Cabinet in the city, and several other gentlemen, at a dinner party last night. A dividend of one hundred cents on the dollar in all filed claims, with a surplus of about $20,000 after making due allowance for reserved claims and reasonable costs in the case, is a new item in the record of the Insolvent Courts. Four years ago the fine timber limits owned by Mr. John Lome McDougall and Mr. Duncan Campbell McDougall were taken possession of by their creditors, and the firm forced into insolvency. At this time a Mr. Fnucr held a mortgage on the properties to the amount of over $40,000 but valued his security at $20,000, and the best experts say that had the estate been turned into a cash realization he could not have got more than $25,000 for the estate. Two banks hold large claims against the concern and he convinced their representatives that the affair was gone up, that they advised the assignee to hand it over to Fiasser and relieve them of the liability. Mr. Bell, of Carleton Place, who was the party in charge, refused to do so. He had every confidence in the recuperative power of the country, and now has the satisfaction of knowing that he has enabled the estate to pay all its claims and have a handsome amount on hand for the benefit of its first owners. It is the intention of the Canadian Pacific Railway, late Canada Central, to appeal against the judgment rendered last week in the suit brought by Mr. Peter McLaren. The case in all probability will go to the Privy Council. A golden wedding took place at Embrun, County of Russell, last Tuesday. The aged couple were Mr. and Mrs. Norumand of that village. A large number of the inhabitants of that vicinity took part in the interesting ceremony. The church was crowded, mass being celebrated by the Rev. Father Ouillame, who also preached an appropriate sermon for the occasion. A meeting of the provisional board of directors of the Winnipeg & Hudson's Bay Railway and Steamship Company was held last evening at their office on York street, when the report of the engineer was laid before them and the stock book opened for subscriptions. The affairs were to a great extent of a private nature, but the report of the engineer must have been eminently satisfactory to the projectors of the scheme, as the whole stock was taken up in the course of a very few minutes. For cogent reasons the gentlemen principally interested in the project have no desire to make the contents of the report known, but there is no doubt that it would reveal facts which make the success of the idea more certain than its most sanguine friends hoped. For a couple of months past a Queen street young man has been wooing a Queen street maiden. The mother of the latter raised objections to the courtship from the first, and the courting was done clandestinely. On Tuesday night the object of the young man's affections smuggled out her clothing to the house of a friend, and on Wednesday, under the pretense of spending the evening at a neighbor's house, she repaired to the friend's residence, where the ever faithful Romeo was awaiting his Juliet. A cab was engaged and the pair were driven to a minister's residence, accompanied by a couple of friends, and the nuptial knot was quietly tied by a clergyman. The party had just arrived at the residence of the groom after the ceremony was performed, when the bride's mother put in an appearance, having become suspicious on account of the daughter's absence from home. Materfamilias' chagrin may be imagined when she found she had arrived too late to prevent the ceremony, and how the young man is happy in the possession of the heroine of this runaway marriage. Advices dated the 10th of January inst., received by J. R. Booth today, announce that the greatest scarcity of snow experienced was in the Mudmika district, where up to the date mentioned, only six inches of snow had fallen. It is, however, thought that the late snowstorm, which probably reached that district, will greatly improve the hauling in that district. Mr. Tilly, engineer of the Canada Atlantic Railway, is at present engaged with his staff in laying out what is to be known as the Chaudière branch of the above railway. This is specially designed as a convenience for the shipment of lumber from that part of the city, and branches will be run into the various lumber yards, as the terminus is to be located near the Chaudière Falls. The construction will involve a considerable amount of engineering skill in effecting the necessary river crossing in that section, the route through Rochesterville will necessitate a rock cutting of not less than fifteen feet in depth. The contract for the Greco's Point locks has not yet been let. During the year just past, 3,500 passengers went from this city to Manitoba. The French Hanward staff have been allotted rooms 91 and 95 formerly occupied by the Supreme Court Judges in the Parliament building.

Recent advices from the Northwest Territories state that in the southern part and along the slope of the Rocky Mountains, where cattle ranches have been established, the season has been most favorable. Beyond one heavy snowstorm at the end of October, which lasted only a few days, the cattle have had abundant pasturing, and up to within a few weeks ago the weather had been remarkably fine. This is indeed encouraging to those who have invested their money in the stock-raising industry, and will have a beneficial effect upon future operations. Many capitalists were holding back awaiting the result of the experiment made by Hon. Senator Cochrane and others, and the fact that their cattle have wintered well will doubtless be the means of inducing them to embark in the enterprise.

The mean of five days from 3rd to 7th inclusive was 9.6, the highest reading 23 on Friday, and 5 below zero on Saturday; the mean of yesterday, however, was 21. A heavy snowstorm occurred on the 6th inst., extending over a wide tract of country, especially in the United States.

The ground may be said to be well covered in this city and vicinity, but not to so great a depth as is customary at this time of year; there have, however, been copious snowfalls within short distances in almost all directions. Snowing here on Tuesday, continuing at short intervals until yesterday morning.

About half-past five o'clock yesterday afternoon, a young boy named Ulderic Dagnon was walking along the revetment wall before the Bonsecours market when his attention was drawn toward a large air hole in the ice, about one hundred yards from shore. The boy was rather puzzled at first, but very soon heard the desperate cries of a man in the water whose head was visible over the water. The boy immediately rushed into the market and in a moment several men ran towards the death trap, but before they could reach near enough to give any assistance, the unfortunate man had been dragged under the ice by the water. The police were notified and Sergeant Kehoe proceeded to the place and made inquiries, but was unable to ascertain the name of the man. How he came there and the manner in which he fell into the water are only conjectured. It is believed that the deceased was employed hauling ice at St. Helen's Island, and on returning to the city went near the hole, probably with the intention of ascertaining the thickness of the ice, when it gave way and he fell into his watery grave. One of my friends from the South said, ""Worcester, Man,"" spoke to me very highly of St. Jacob's Oil, resolved to try it on my patients, and I must confess that I was surprised at the results.

THE STEAMSHIP PERUVIAN SAFE IN PORT AT LAST An eventful voyage, FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT, J Q'kiki, May 23 The steamship Peruvian, which has been 21 days out, arrived in port at 6 p.m. today in tow of the tug Korf and the steamship Acadian from St. Pierre. Her passage was both an eventful and a tedious one, owing to heavy snowstorms, fog and damage to screw, and at one time she owed her safety to a providential change in the wind. Off Cape Ray difficulties began. A few days previous icebergs were seen, but on the morning of May the 7th, the tenth day after sailing, nothing could be seen ahead but an immense field of ice as far as the eye could reach, and about a dozen ships were passed during the day which had come to anchor, waiting for the ice to break. At 11 o'clock that night the Peruvian was unable to proceed any further. The next morning she put on full steam, and made a desperate effort to reach her way through the icy barrier, but had not gone far before she broke her screw and lay hopelessly fast-bound. The SS Lake Huron lay in sight behind, and two other steamers, one of which was supposed to be the Polyntisian. On May 8th a snowstorm set in, whose dispiriting effect took all the efforts of the most persistent Mark Tapleys on board to counteract. On the 10th the outlook was still far from cheering. The steerage passengers were reduced to short rations. In the event of the vessel being detained in the ice for a month, which then appeared to be by no means an unlikely event, biscuits were ordered to be served out only every other morning and oatmeal gruel was altogether dispensed with, a hardship which was keenly felt by the women and children. On the 11th the ice began to move, but the vessel made very little progress. The weather was beautifully clear, and at night the northern lights made a magnificent display. Nothing eventful occurred to disturb the monotony on board until the 12th, when a commotion arose over the apprehension of a man who had been caught rifling some trunks. Some of them would have lynched him had it not been for the intervention of the steward, and for the remainder of the trip the man had to be escorted to meals and go on deck for safety immediately afterwards. The Lake Huron had by this time got up steam, and cleared her way through the floating ice. On the 13th not a vessel was in sight, and the ice became thicker than ever, and she was blown so close to land that it was feared she would go ashore. The wind veering round she was aided out into the open sea again. On the 7th a schooner hove in sight and was signaled. A boat was lowered, and the purser got on board, with instructions to make for the nearest telegraph station to send news to Quebec. At 8 p.m. he had not returned, though anxiously expected, and rockets were fired every ten minutes. On the 18th the schooner came in sight, but could not get alongside, owing to the ice, and the captain and purser walked over the ice, which was in lumps of about 30 feet thick and 50 wide, to the steamer, from which a boat was lowered, and they were taken on board. The purser brought the good tidings that three steamers were on the lookout for the distressed vessel since the 11th. After hailing a couple of steamers, which proved to be strangers, the crew and passengers had the delight of being hailed by the Griffin, and shortly afterwards by the Acadian with provisions on board. The Peruvian was taken in tow by the Acadian, the Griffin keeping alongside, and on the 21st the Rocket also came to the rescue. In tow of the Acadian and Rocket she came in port this afternoon, thus ending this prolonged voyage with fortunately no loss of life, but an addition to the living freight, for two infants were born amid those untoward circumstances. One of them was christened Allan, after the steamship company. About 800 passengers were on board, most of whom are bound for Ontario and the Northwest. The above account is taken from the diary of one of the steerage passengers, and gives but an inadequate idea of the many incidents of the eventful voyage. IMPERIAL BILL, London, May 23 Sir Wm. Harcourt stated in the House of Commons today that Davitt is subject to the conditions of the ticket of leave, which will be revoked if he speaks contrary to law and order. The House of Commons adopted the motion of Mr. Gladstone that the various stages of the Repression bill and the adjourned debate on the repeal of Rent bill have precedence over all other business until the House otherwise orders. Mr. Henry Smith advocated an emigration scheme as the true remedy for the misery of small tenants. Mr. Lowther (Conservative) considered the proposed gilt premium a sham, and maintained that the Government made an ignominious surrender to the forces of lawlessness and crime. Mr. Selater Routh's amendment that it is inexpedient to charge the consolidated fund with any payment for arrears except in the form of a loan, was rejected by 200 to 150. The bill then passed second reading by 211 to 167. On motion to go into committee on the Repression bill, Mr. O'Keen (Unheal) moved an amendment declaring that while the House is desirous of aiding the Government in detecting crime, it disapproves of the restrictions on the free expression of public opinion in Ireland. Thompson and Russell (Liberals) supported the amendment. Plunkett (Conservative) supported the bill, and alluded to the inhuman sentiments expressed by O'Donovan Rossa. The amount of arrears of rent owed by tenants in Ireland which the bill before the Commons would wipe out is £700,000. The immediate effect of the measure will be to save tens of thousands of families from eviction and restore a home to thousands of families already evicted. It is reported that Sir Wm. Harcourt threatens to resign from the Cabinet unless the Government carry through the Crime Prevention Act in its original form and undertake to enforce its provisions rigorously. It is thought Davitt's speech at Manchester has destroyed all hope of obtaining any modification of the Coercion Act. A, London, May 23 The Russian press has been ordered to omit hereafter any report of the massacre of Jews, and not to discuss the question. Smorgoni, between Wilna and Minsk, has been burned.

THE SITUATION IN EGYPT An alarming outlook - the rebellion - negotiations between consuls and ministers break down completely. London, May 23 It is understood that private despatches from Egypt indicate that the situation is becoming alarming, and it is generally considered that the presence of Turkish troops will be necessary to prevent an outbreak. Cairo, May 23 The Ministers are inciting the ulema and populace by representing that the foreign fleets have been sent to ruin the country. The negotiations between the Consuls and Ministry have completely failed. The Ministry refuses further negotiations unless the fleets are withdrawn. The Council of War has decided to favor active military preparations. It is rumored that England and France have resolved to send an ultimatum to the Ministry. If it is disregarded, France will waive objections to the landing of Turkish troops."

"18820830","I. That there is conflicting evidence as to whether the mind (or minds) that made and rules matter is benevolent or malevolent. It is extremely difficult for one who has known and basked in the full sunshine of the Gospel of Christ to divest himself of all his knowledge and try to imagine how much (or rather how little) he would know if left to the guidance of the Gospel of Nature alone. It is like asking us to leave the light of day and enter some dark cavern into which no light of sun or moon ever penetrates, through even the smallest chinks. At first we are in total darkness, as we think, and no eyesight or knowledge seems possible. After some time, however, we note that the cavern contains living things; bats, eyeless fish, and other creatures which can exist with an amount of light much short of that to which we ourselves have been accustomed. We grope our way around, and by degrees find that we can discern obscurely some dim objects in the darkness, and can avoid injuring ourselves by stumbling against the rocks, or falling into the deep pitfalls and holes in the gloomy region which we have entered. Let us examine those who have entered the dark cave of nature before us, and who have never had the brighter light of sun or moon to guide them, and inquire what their testimony was. I call up Cicero on the first question, who says, noting the orderly movement and method which exists in many parts of nature (especially among the heavenly bodies), ""Nothing, indeed, which is moved with rule and number can possibly exist without design; in which design there is nothing rash, variable, or by chance."" The doctrine that mind rules matter was never taught more plainly; but this teaching was not accepted by all who followed the light of nature. Claudius Galen accepts and teaches it, for he says: ""Thus man is the wisest of animals, and therefore has hands, limbs suitable to a wise animal; he is not the wisest animal because he has hands (as Anaxagoras declared), but he has hands because he is the wisest animal (as Aristotle says, knowing best)."" The wisest, most thoughtful, and best of the ancients, from the study of nature, came to the conclusion that most probably mind ruled matter, and that there actually was a maker and ruler of heaven and earth; but even this elementary truth was steadily denied and opposed, from the study of the same nature, by an intelligent and persistent minority. Lucretius is the best-known of the ancients who denied that design proves a designer. His brilliant genius partially anticipated the modern chemical theory of atoms and molecules, but he deceived himself (as Cicero has well pointed out), in supposing that he had gotten the idea that mind rules matter. Modern science has shown that the small number of chemical elements of which the whole universe is composed are by no means the blind random atoms of Epicurus. On careful study of their several multiform qualities, all the appearances from the outset are of well-considered, carefully wrought, and highly manufactured articles, fresh from the hand of the Almighty maker, in whose works Nihil est temerarium, nihil variatum, nihil fortuitum. Again, the principles known as the conservation of force, and the dissipation of energy, render it as certain as a mathematical demonstration that the present order and laws of nature, if left to themselves, must end in the entire universe arriving sooner or later in a state of death, of absence of all motion, physical as well as vital. The dying universe may console itself in its last moments with the poor reflection that its heat is uniformly distributed throughout its corpse, and does not vary from part to part. But that is all. If it be thus certain, then, that the universe, if left to itself, must have an end, it is equally certain that it must have had a beginning. This remarkable conclusion, drawn from the facts of the exact sciences, was, I believe, first publicly stated by a leader of science, a distinguished Irishman, known to many of you, William Thomson, of Belfast. He thus sums up his demonstration in the following propositions: ""There is at present in the material world a universal tendency to the dissipation of mechanical energy. Any gain of mechanical energy without a corresponding loss of dissipation is impossible in inanimate material processes. Within a finite period of time past, the earth must have been, and within a finite period of time to come the earth must again be, uninhabitable for the habitation of man as at present constituted, unless operations have been or are about to be performed, which are impossible under the laws to which the known operations going on at present in the material world are subject."" In other words, something outside the line and her laws has interfered in time past, and will again interfere in time to come. This is the nearest approach yet made by the intellect of man to demonstrate that Mind rules Matter, and to justify our natural belief in Almighty God, the Maker and Ruler of heaven and earth. When we pass from the first dogma of the Gospel of Nature and proceed to the second, which concerns the moral character and intention of the mind that rules matter, we find our witnesses involved in hopeless contradictions and disputes. Observers in all ages are agreed that there is a dark side as well as a bright side to the face and phenomena of nature. The Egyptian fable tells us that the votaries of the goddess Nature were divided in opinion as to whether she was transcendently beautiful or hideously ugly, and that in order to keep up this difference of opinion, which suits her purposes, she always wears a thick veil over her face. For, with a veil that whirled everywhere, her head and face were hid, that none might appear; that some do say, was for by skill devised, to hide the terror of her uncouth hue from mortal eyes that should be sore aghast; for that her face did like a lion show, that eye of light could not endure to view. But others tell that it is beauteous wax, and round about such beams of splendour brow. What if the sun a thousand times did pass, nor could be seen, but like an image in a glass? It has been well observed by a witty philosopher, that the whole of Nature is summed up in the conjugation (active and passive) of a single verb: To eat and to be eaten is the common life and death work of all living things. This remark hits the truth very closely, and shows how little of a fatherly sentiment of mercy is involved in the study of nature alone, without the guidance of a higher light. The desperate competition for food must develop and benefit either the eaters or the eaten, or may develop both, side by side, into higher types possessed on the one hand of more powerful instruments of destruction, and on the other hand, possessed of more rapid organs of flight. A necessary consequence of this fierce struggle is the merciless destruction of all useless beings; the wounded animal or bird is set upon by his fellows and at once destroyed; the lioness whose milk has failed at once eats her cubs, destroying them in such a manner that not one particle of precious food shall be wasted; the useless drones are driven from the hive; the worn-out worker bee commits voluntary suicide; the female spiders kill and eat their mates; whatever has ceased to be useful is destroyed and utilized as food where possible. The social habits of bees, spiders, and other communities of animals would justify man, if he followed the light of nature only, in cold-blooded selfish murder, in suicide, and in the most selfish forms of slave-driving. Our hospitals would disappear, our alms-houses and orphanages would polish our useless members of society, whether useless from old age or sickness, would be quietly smothered; our superfluous children would be got rid of. This may seem a hideous picture of nature, but it is drawn by the hand of Nature herself; and in it alone, without other light, I can read no trace of a Heavenly Father, but rather that of a harsh and cruel stepmother. Man, left to the light (or darkness) of Nature, would sink to the level of those wondrous archaic types or embryonic forms of animal life that swarm in the broad depths of ocean, and are born, live, and die, in the everlasting cold and darkness of those dreary regions. How different the picture drawn from the words of Him who was Himself the Maker of all things! The birds of the air neither sow, nor reap, nor gather corn into barns; because the Heavenly Father feeds them. The lilies of the field toil not, nor spin, and yet they grow, and are clothed by the Heavenly Father with gorgeous raiment, surpassing all the glory of King Solomon. The drenched and battered sparrow, driven before the snowstorm on a winter's day, may not fall to the ground without the express permission of the Heavenly Father. For man himself then follow the glorious tidings, ""Fear not, therefore, ye are of more value than many fowls, or many lilies, or many sparrows."" Compare this loving sympathy with everything that lives, with the cold, harsh snap of even St. Paul, the greatest of His followers. ""It is written in the law of Moses, thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?"" If we include man in our estimate of Nature, matters become still worse; the lightnings of Jove often throw down his own temples, and he expends his rage, withdrawing into the desert to practice his wrath, which often passes by the guilty and falls upon the innocent. Philosophers and poets in modern times are in as much doubt as the ancients were as to the moral character that underlies the phenomena of Nature. I shall quote two witnesses. Here is the first: ""Nature impales men, breaks them as if on the wheel, casts them to be devoured by wild beasts, crushes them with stones like the first Christian martyr, starves them with hunger, freezes them with cold, poisons them by the quick or slow venom of her exhalations, and has hundreds of other hideous deaths in reserve, such as the ingenious cruelty of a Nabis or a Romulus never surpassed. All this Nature does with the most supercilious disregard both of mercy and justice, employing her shafts upon the best and noblest individuals, equally with the meanest and worst; upon those who are engaged in the highest and worthiest enterprises, and often as the direct consequence of the noblest acts; and it might almost be imagined as a punishment for them, she mows down those on whose existence hangs the well-being of a whole people, perhaps the prospect of the human race for generations to come, with as little compunction as a brute whose death is a relief to themselves, or a blessing to those under their noxious influence."" Much are nature's dealings with life. You have heard the Philosopher, now listen to the Poet: ""Are God and Nature then at strife? That Nature made such evil dreams, So careful of the type she seems; So careless of the single life. ""So careful of the type! But no, From searped rock and quarreled alone She cries, a thousand types are gone. I care for nothing, all shall go, ""Man, her last work, who seemed so fair, Such splendid purpose in his eye! Who rolled the psalm in wintry skin; Who built him fanes of fruitless prayer; ""Who trusted God was love indeed And love's own final law, Though Nature, red in tooth and claw With ravin, shrieked against his creed."" ""No more? A monster then, a dream, A discord! dragons of the prime That tear each other in their slime, Were mellowed in malevolence with him."" This horrible creed is the Gospel of Nature! For this base, selfish, and cruel creed I am asked to surrender the Gospel of Christ; to give up the Cross of Calvary; to abandon the higher and holiest purpose of my whole life, which is to follow Christ, to imitate His self-sacrifice, and to devote all I have and am to Him and to those that love Him. If the preachers of this Nature-Gospel offer me instead of Christ the beggarly elements of their selfish creed: I ask of them bread, they give me a stone; I ask a fish, they offer me a serpent. I reject their Gospel with contempt; their priests have stolen from the Crown of the Gospel of Christ its most rare and precious jewels, and have then pretended to the world that they found them in the mines of Nature in their own honest search after Truth. We come into this beautiful world of sunshine, of rain, of storms; of spring, summer, autumn, and winter; of pleasure and pain, of love and hatred, we know not how, and we leave it we know not why. To most of us, like the flies born at sunrise and destined to perish at sunset, its mysteries cost not a single thought; we flutter our little life through it and know not what it means. To the thoughtful few its aspect is sad and mournful. Our life is so short, and the lives of all we see around us so short, that we become impressed with an undue idea of the longevity and permanence of nature and her processes. How rash is this conclusion! A little thought will suffice to show: 1. The life of the individual is but an infinitesimal part of the life of the species or race to which he belongs. 2. The life of the species is but an infinitesimal part of the geological period to which it belongs. 3. The geological period is but an infinitesimal part of the whole geological time, during which terrestrial living things have existed. 4. The whole of geological time is but an infinitesimal part of the duration of the little solar system to which we happen to belong. 5. The whole duration of our solar system is but an infinitesimal part of the duration of the stellar systems of which we form a small part. 6. The whole duration of stellar systems is but an infinitesimal part of the duration of those impersonal (or miraculous) causes that first set the Laws of Nature in motion and which day by day maintain them. 7. And, last of all, the duration of these miraculous, immutable causes is lost in the infinite First Cause which has been, and is, and shall be forever. Rapid flux and change is the order of Nature, and not permanence and stability. Many of the so-called fixed stars are moving in space at rates varying from 70 to 200 miles per second (at which latter rate a passage could be made from Cambridge to Peking in a single minute), and come and go so swiftly, that it is highly probable that of the stars of the constellations pictured on the retina of the last millennium or Ptolemaic times, not a single one is now visible through our telescopes, and yet these creatures lived in times extremely recent as compared with other times which we can compute. Beyond this endless flux and change of Matter and of Nature, there lies the eternal repose of the fixed unerring laws and truths of God. I have sat beside many death-beds, and have seen and studied many forms of death in its changing phases, and I have there learned that there are truths in the system of things as real and as certain as any laws of Nature, although we cannot perceive them with our senses. My eyes cannot see them; my ears may not hear them; nor can I touch them with my hands, but they are there. I know them to be true, and that they will endure when Nature and her laws shall have passed away like the memory of a troubled dream. I testify what I have seen; I have many a time seen an humble, earnest faith in these unseen truths cause a smile of joy to play upon the pale face distorted with pain, like a sunbeam dancing on the bosom of the troubled ocean. I have seen those truths illumine with a light from heaven the dim eyes soon to be closed forever by the cold hand of death. These truths are more dear to me than all that Nature can teach me, because they touch my inner life and consciousness. I learned these truths as a little child at my mother's knee; I cherish them in my heart of hearts; and in defense of them, if opportunity should offer and God should count me worthy, I would gladly lay down my life. OUR PANAMA LETTER. An election riot—liberal shoolus of opinions; politics from Australia. An opening for cultivating trade. FROM OUR RESIDENT CORRESPONDENT. Panama, August 18th. The election yesterday in this city came off quietly, although rumors of a revolution were rife for a time. In our sister city, Colon, certain deputies (Assemblymen), who sought re-election and failed, made things well ""tropically warm."" They openly shot two men connected with the party in power. The shooting was of a highly satisfactory nature to the shootees, one man being killed on the spot, and the other fatally wounded. They (the assassins) are at large, unwhipped of Justice, and likely to remain so, as their supporters are armed with revolvers. If the country fails to kill a man of yellow fever, he may suddenly find himself converted into a lead-mine by one of these tropical jokers. Ten years imprisonment is the extreme penalty of the law for murder, but few get it at any time. To leave the ""authentic"" and return to pleasanter themes, the following from the Star and Herald caused a good deal of surprise here: Another shipment of Australian potatoes has arrived in Panama, consigned to Messrs. Kurth and Campbell. It may appear remarkable that Panama should be receiving a shipment of its provisions from such a distant source, yet more remarkable that such perishable articles should arrive here in good condition. The first lot sold at auction realized good prices, so that probably this new channel of trade will become a beaten route. Potatoes from the Antipodes! Sending coal to Newcastle is nothing to this, as potatoes were originally introduced to the world from these countries; hence the Chili potato, etc. These tubers traveled some 9,000 miles to reach Panama, and sold for an excellent price, the retail price being from five to ten cents a pound (the Colombian dollar is worth 80c gold). Cannot Canadian export merchants secure some of this trade? Canadian potatoes are of the best, and furnish seed for the celebrated Bermuda potatoes. Now that Canada has a line of steamships trading with the Brazils, a trade might be opened with Colombia on the Atlantic side. Making Colon (Aspinwall) a port of call in the outward voyage, it would be en route to Brazil. Canadian lumber and products doubtless would be sold to advantage. In a recent number of the Gazette, Mr. Huntley, the agent of the company, is credited with saying that among the other good things introduced into Canada was Balsam Copaiba. It is painful, to say the least, that our countrymen require a steamship load of the latter. Still necessity has no law, and although we cannot furnish the Copaiba we can supply you with another member of the Balsam family—the Tola. Scenes of millennial bliss, cargoes of potatoes for Colombians and Brazilians, steamship loads of the two balsams for loyal Canadians. For ""Auld Lang Syne"" let us pray that the balance of the trade will be in favor of Canada. The servant of Queen Victoria, for the first time since the death of Prince Albert, let off their crape armlets, in the wedding day of Prince Leopold.

Evans, which cleared at this port on the 17th instant, with a deal cargo for London by Bryant, Powell & Bryant, went ashore on North Sand Beach, Magdalen Islands, one mile east of Wolfe Island telegraph station, at 12:10 yesterday, midnight, in a terrific easterly gale and snowstorm. The crew hung by her until 11 o'clock yesterday, when she broke in four pieces. Only four men were saved out of twenty. The remaining sixteen were lost in trying to reach the land. Those saved were the Chief Engineer Hutchinson, McLachlan, Townsend and Martin. The Wearmouth was a steamer of 1101 tons register, built at Sunderland, Eng., in 1880, and owned there. She was constructed particularly for the coal trade, being entirely of iron, and without between decks or bulkheads forward or aft of the engine partitions. She had been employed during the summer carrying coal from Sydney to Montreal. The cargo consisted of 627 three-inch pine deals, 2,102 three-inch pine deal ends, 19,981 three-inch spruce deals, 635 cases match splints, 1,141 two-inch pine plank and 6,321 two-inch spruce plank. A rear of Knit Ael Kilmarnock Treaty motion The Gray came, London, November 21, Unless the Government gives satisfactory assurance on Thursday in regard to the Arrears of Rent Act, Mr. Parnell will move the Adjournment of the House in order to call attention to the threatened failure of the Act. Toward the close of last evening's session in the Commons, Mr. Gladstone moved the adjournment of the House on the procedure rules in redemption of his promise to give Mr. Yorke an opportunity to move the appointment of a committee of enquiry into the release of Messrs. Parnell, Dillon and O'Kelley from Kilmainham gaol. Mr. Labouchere, by opposing the motion for adjournment, talked out Mr. Yorke's motion. In the House of Commons tonight, Gladstone refused to allow Yorke a further opportunity of discussing the Kilmainham affair. In the House of Commons, the Procedure rules were taken up. Discussing the ninth rule, relative to the suspension of members from service of the House, Mr. Nolan referred to the suspension of Irish members, and stated that on that occasion he received a communication from the Clerk of the House, asking him if he wished to be suspended. Lord Churchill said if, after the statement made by Mr. Nolan, Mr. Playfair did not explain the matter to the House, he would have proved himself utterly incapacitated for his position as chairman of committees. After discussion the matter dropped. Mr. Gladstone offered a motion, which was adopted, that the term of suspension for a second offence be reduced from a month to a fortnight, and for a third offence for a month instead of the remainder of the session. The Committee investigating the imprisonment of Gray today reconsidered their report. The sixteenth paragraph was rejected, only Sexton, McCarthy and Dilwyn voting for it. PROVIDENCE, RI, November 21, A fire broke out today in the Calendar building, occupied partly by a jeweler's shop. The ladders were slow in coming, and a panic occurred among the girls, and a number jumped from the windows, it is reported with fatal results. (Second dispatch) The fire originated in Melvin's dye shop, on the third floor, caused by the agitation of naphtha. The room was filled with inflammable clothes; the woodwork was dry as tinder. The room was next to the stairway, and before warning was given escape by the stairway was cut off. On the fourth floor was the workshop of Robinson & Co., gold chain makers. The firm employed 40 operatives, half of them females. As the flames swept up the floor the employees rushed for the windows. There was no fire escape, and a panic ensued. Across an alley 15 feet wide at the end of the Calendar building was a two-story structure. The excited girls congregated at the window, and tried to jump onto its roof 20 feet below. Persons in the rear pushed those in the act of jumping, and many fell short. Others were injured by being jumped upon after they reached the roof. Emma Gassett, aged 23, and Bessie Cobb struck the ground between the two buildings, and died in a few minutes. Mary McSorley fell on a picket fence and was so terribly injured that she cannot live. Mary Unity, Delia Gassett, Emma Matthews, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Cuddy, young women, were all probably fatally injured. Some were carried home, others to the hospital. Thomas Mann fell short of the building, bounded against it, and fell to the ground, an arm and leg being broken. A man named Smith fell to the ground and was badly hurt. Mary Davis jumped from the roof and had her leg broken. George Grant, of Grant & Co., jeweler, also jumped from the floor to the roof of the lower building and had a leg broken. An employee hung from a telephone wire until the firemen arrived and a ladder was raised under him, but was five feet short. A fireman ran up to the top and caught the workman in his arms.

B., November 22 Advices from Charlottetown state that the snowstorm of Sunday night and Monday was most severe. On the whole of the Island Railway the snow was extremely heavy and packed into ice quickly. Trains were stuck at various points on the line. Telegraph lines between Mount Stewart and Souris were broken in twenty places on account of the snow and sleet accumulating on the wires. Telegraph communication east of Charlottetown was suspended until late in the afternoon. Some malicious scoundrel misplaced a switch near Georgetown, throwing the engine and baggage car of the express off the track, delaying that train several hours. The evening accommodation train from Charlottetown for Tignish had two cars off the track in a snowdrift a mile east of Summerside, caused by ice forming on the rails. Men were at work nearly all night replacing the cars. Owing to the prevailing storm it was a laborious job. An election took place on the Island last week to fill six seats in the Legislative Council. The Opposition favored the retention of the Council; the Government favored its abolition. The Opposition elected four of the six. Recently two Indians, Lubobe and Paul, left Indian Island in a canoe to go to Malecite and were never heard of since, though the other Micmacs have been making all possible search for them.

Mr. Morrison, describing the account said: ""We were making headway at about six miles an hour, when there came a tremendous crash. A construction train drawn by an engine with the tender in front ran into us. The tender crashed through the end of the Pullman car, coming right through the offices in the rear. The tanks were broken, and the water came in like a wave, wetting us through. Chips and splinters of wood and pieces of glass flew in all directions. It was a miracle there was nobody killed in our car. The car was so badly telescoped that the rear trucks were forced right up to the front ones. There was only one lady in the car, and she was very self-possessed. Mr. Morrison lost a fur-lined coat worth $150, and other passengers lost a few things. Mr. Leckie said: ""In the cab of the engine belonging to the gravel train were the engineer, whose name was Brown, the stoker, a young man belonging to Moncton, and the brakesman, James Fraser. As the cab came in through the Pullman, its occupants could not escape, and the escaping steam and water rendered their rescue extremely perilous. We broke the window of the cab and got them out. They were all alive, but terribly scalded. The stoker died in fearful agony before we reached Newcastle, and Fraser died just after arriving there. The driver was alive when we left Newcastle, but he can hardly recover."" The Pullman and the engine which telescoped were badly damaged. As to the CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT, it is stated that the Quebec train was two hours behind time, that she was moving at the rate of about five miles an hour only, and that she was steaming slowly in the face of a blinding snowstorm. The other train was coming down at a good speed, supposing that the Quebec train was out of the way, and the consequence was she telescoped the Pullman. The usual lights were burning on the rear of the Pullman car. ALBERT SNOWSHOE CLUB.

The lad, in company with his brother, about 8 years old, and another boy named Languorne, about 17, were shoveling grain in a large wheat bin with a spout leading to the cars underneath. There was about 4,000 bushels of wheat in the bin, and Simmons was near the spout, trying to get a scoop shovel which was being carried down the spout, and as the grain was running so fast he began to go down himself. Languorne leaned over an iron bar and held on to him for 20 minutes, but could not possibly save him. He was carried down, and before he could be taken out life was extinct.

Halifax, November 27 A few days ago a telegram was published containing a very brief account of the wreck of the SS Wearmouth, Capt. Evans, on one of the shores of the Magdalen Islands, in the Gulf, and the death of sixteen of her crew by the disaster. Last night the five survivors arrived in this city, having taken the mail steamer Beaver at Magdalen Islands, which took them to Picton, and from there they came to Halifax. The chief engineer of the Wearmouth, Robert Hutchison, was the only officer of the crew carried by the ship who succeeded in saving himself. He says that the ship was commanded by Evan Evans, laden with phosphate, sailed from Montreal on the 3rd instant for London, England. She stopped at Quebec, took in a quantity of other cargo and proceeded on the 10th. Fine clear weather was experienced until the 19th at 1 o'clock, on the morning of which day Cape Rosier was passed. Early in the day the wind freshened, then began to increase in strength, until when darkness came on a stiff gale was blowing. Early in the night the wind and sea continued to increase, a heavy snowstorm set in and all about the ship was dense blackness of night, and the eyes of those watching above could see very little ahead. At 10:30 o'clock, when the storm was blowing fiercely, and those on deck consisted of the captain, George T. Draper and three men, the captain gave the signal to stop. Chief engineer Hutchison was in the boiler-room alone, and he at once sprang to shut off the steam from his engines, but he had hardly started to turn the lever when the signal sounded full speed astern. Less than ten seconds later, before the order given by the captain could be carried out, the steamer STRUCK WITH A TERRIBLE SHOCK; the engines were reversed and kept working to try and drag her off, but of no avail. She had grounded on a sand beach, and bumped and pitched about, continually refusing to stir. The engines were kept running until it was seen to be useless to attempt to get her off, and then Captain Evans stopped them. After half an hour had passed, the engineer shut off steam and eased the valves. By this time all the ship's hands, most of whom had turned in for the night, were collected, getting the boats ready to abandon the ship. Hutchison set to work to help, and soon all were swung in their davits to be lowered at a moment's notice. Having done everything that could be done, the crew took shelter in the houses above the deck and in the chart, galley, and salerooms, until the storm moderated. All were cool and collected, and obeyed the captain's orders. Hutchison at intervals made a visit to his engine-room, but found little water entering until about two o'clock in the morning, when he went down and found it beginning to show in the stoke holes. He came up and reported this to the captain. Through all this time the ship was straining fearfully as she pitched on the beach, and on one of the engineer's visits below he found several planks in the boiler and the stays broken, the boilers themselves tossing about. About two a.m. the seas had broken in front of the chart room, and driven out those who were sheltering there into the sail room on the bridge. Two hours after another wave swept across the ship, carried away the galley room, and compelled the twenty men on board to take protection in the sail room. Between four o'clock and daylight the hatches blown or torn from their fastenings by the fierce gale were carried away, and the contents of the hold were open to the waves. The men, clinging to what they could in the sail room to preserve their lives as long as possible, could see the sea carry off in huge quantities the cargo stored in the holds. At daylight the steamer was seen to be fast breaking in two just forward of the bridge, and before she was abandoned the forward portion broke into pieces. The vessel continued to pitch about, and her bottom was fast broken in. About eight o'clock the funnel telescoped and went below. The steamer, which had apparently struck about a mile from shore, was now being slowly washed nearer in over the sandy bottom, the masts and yards threatening to come down. At ten o'clock the stern of the vessel commenced to show signs of parting, but the crew still stood by her, thinking it better to do so than to risk their lives in their poor boats. About eleven o'clock the upper bridge began to break away, and the men called for the boats. Then Captain Evans gave orders to get into the boats, and all at once started out on deck. The chief engineer remained behind a moment to secure two life-preservers he had observed. Nobody else had apparently noticed them, and taking them he went on deck, where he found all hands except Captain Evans and the second mate. After Hutchison was in the boat he observed the captain trying to lower the jolly boat and went to his assistance, followed by the second mate. The three found the boat contained only three oars, broken and useless. The ship was by this time almost broken apart and the two sections threatened to part. Captain Evans, afraid the jolly boat would get caught in the break and be crushed, cried out, to catch the oars and shove her off. The next moment the three men were tossed about by the sea. While the captain used the useless oar, the second mate and the engineer were bailing her out. Two waves were passed over by the boat, but a third caught it, knocked it broadside to the sea, and, despite the efforts of those in it, she could not again be brought around. The captain tried to keep it before the sea, but a fourth breaker swamped the boat and sent its occupants out of sight. When the engineer rose he could not see a soul, and striking out at once for land, with the life-buoy fastened about his body, he succeeded in reaching it in an exhausted state, after a struggle of twenty minutes. Hutchinson succeeded in reaching one of the deals from the ship. On nearing the land another difficulty was encountered, a very strong undertow. Hutchinson could not, in his weak state, get far up, but a breaker caught him on his top and rolled him up onto the beach. He had just reached a place of safety when he observed another man, Hugh McLachland, the boatman, making endeavors to get beyond the clutches of the breakers. McLachland, who was the first Hutchinson had seen since leaving the wreck, after a while managed to reach Hutchinson. Both were so exhausted by their efforts to get to the shore and with the exposure that for a time they were unable to walk, and they lay on the sand to regain strength enough to proceed to the nearest house, which was about a mile distant. While lying here John Townsend and John Martin, two able-bodied seamen, joined them, they having by clinging to the floating lumber, made the shore. Like their comrades, they were also too dispirited and exhausted to move about much or endeavor to go to the house. The four wrecked men, having rested themselves as best they could and seeing nobody else from the steamer, made their way towards the house, reaching it after painfully toiling for three hours. On arrival they found it was a telegraph station, but the operator was away procuring a supply of provisions, and no one was found to admit them. They broke open the door and built themselves a fire, upon which they prepared some tea and bread they had discovered. About five o'clock p.m. the operator returned, and from him it was learned that the Wearmouth had struck on Wolle Island, a stretch of land about twenty miles long, and situated a mile east of Point du Loup. The point where the ship grounded was of sandy bottom, but if she had struck a mile or more to the west she would have at once been smashed to pieces, probably, and not a soul survive. An hour or so before the return of the operator, a Frenchman named Longueby came to the house, and learning of the disaster, started to search for any other survivors, but towards dark he came back alone unsuccessful. The night was spent at the telegraph station by the men. They had been knocked about considerably by floating deals while in the water, and the engineer found them somewhat weaker and suffering more from the exposure than he himself. In the morning McLachland told the engineer of the PATH of the BOAT containing the greater number of the men. After Captain Evans had left and while all were attempting to clear it from the davits, one man cut the painter and tinkled with an axe, causing the boat to swing on board and strike the boat chocks. It capsized and its seventeen occupants all went into the water. The scene which then transpired was a terrible one, the seventeen tumbling about in the water making frantic efforts to right the boat. Finally they disappeared one by one beneath the water. When the boat fell in all surrounded it and endeavored to turn it over, but those on each side prevented its accomplishment, and it was given up. Some climbed into the bottom only to slide off, and others made a desperate attempt to do the same. The clinging of one to another in desperation, and the last closing cry as they slowly sunk, made a picture nobody would wish to view. A second time McLachland, Townsend and Martin, keeping as collected as possible, managed to steer clear of those about them who were making such desperate but useless attempts to save themselves, and swam towards land, finally reached it, and, as reported, joined Hutchinson. After daylight on Tuesday morning they prepared to search for any survivors or for the bodies of those who had perished. The Frenchman, Longueby, then arrived at the house, accompanied by one of the steamer's firemen, a Maltese, named Antonio Alagro, who had, after gaining the land, spent the night in the bushes and was in a very weak state from exposure and hunger. Leaving him in the lighthouse they made a thorough search through the lumber washed ashore and through the bushes, but failed to discover any traces of the remaining members of the crew. Marks of blood were found on some of the deals but no bodies were found. It was determined to take the mail steamer for Pictou. The men, now increased in number to five, reached House Harbour the following day, and, with the assistance of the receiver of wrecks, were forwarded by the Beaver on to Nova Scotia. Owing to stormy weather the departure of the Beaver was delayed and it was eleven o'clock yesterday morning when they arrived in Pictou."

The Arts and Agricultural Association met this morning at the Agricultural Hall, Mr. Drury, the President, in the chair. Hon. Mr. Wood appeared before the board and stated that the Government were considering the advisability of establishing three creameries throughout the province for the purpose of teaching the farmers the progress of scientific butter-making. The improvement of our butter, he said, was a most important matter, as we manufactured in the province about fifty million pounds of butter, the greater portion of which was of very inferior quality. He suggested that the association should take the matter and make a recommendation to the Government. The Board decided to hold the next Provincial Exhibition in 1883, at Ottawa, commencing on the 10th of September. At the evening session Messrs. Lynch and Bessis were heard in reference to their schemes of educating the farmers in the art of butter-making, and a committee was appointed to take the subject into consideration. The finance committee brought up their report, recommending that the Government be asked to grant for next year $10,000 for the following purposes: Prize farms, $200; Council expenses, $721; Veterinary College, $125; essays, $100; exhibition, $3,000; ploughing matches, $1,200; education, $500; salaries, $1,600; incidental, $600.

And a muffled response comes on the sharp crisp air from a score or more safe by the kitchen stove. ""Even Mansill, the great planetary meteorologist,"" after summarizing the meteoric disturbing positions of the planets for the month, remarks that the temperature will average above the mean of the season both in Europe and the United States. December will be warm and stormy, with the rain further inland and considerable thunder and lightning for the season. ""Mr. Vennor, over date of July 1, foretold the present ""cold fore part of December,"" and added that this wave would be ""generally felt."" He also stated in subsequent Bulletin that this cold snap would travel far to the southward, and give sleighing as far south as Virginia and that England and Scotland, as well as Europe, would experience winter ""heavy snowfalls on both sides of the Atlantic."" Yesterday morning cold weather was reported as far south as the Gulf of Mexico, and heavy snowfall over two-thirds of the continent. The December of a year ago was one of the warmest on record, and dust was flying in clouds on the last day of the year. Mr. Vennor consequently has again re-established his reputation for general accuracy. Unfortunately, the present condensation of winter suggests the extreme probability of the ""great January breakup"" likewise predicted, which, as have already stated in these columns, Mr. Vennor thinks may set in immediately at the close of the year, or close after the entry of the New Year. There is, however, again a possibility of two rather severe months being coupled together, with a few intervals of mildness. The wintry weather, just now, in England and portions of Europe is in support rather of Mr. Vennor's than Hazan's theory as touching the characters of winters following cold and wet summers. The following from Vennor's forecast for December will demonstrate his very close reading of the weather up to date, and the prospects for the week approaching DECEMBER: 1 to 3 Snow falls and cold weather, Storms on Lake and Atlantic, 3 to 10 Steady winter weather probable, with cold weather in North, West and West, 10 to 17 Much of week mild weather, Colder with snowstorm 16th and 17th, Heavy cold rains to southward, Stormy weather Chicago and westward, 17 to 24 Moderate weather after 17th with heavy rains south, 24 to 31 A general week of storm and cold weather in all sections, with heavy snowfalls, Stormy on Atlantic and English coast, Probably a stormy entry of the New Year, WEATHER BRIEFS DECEMBER, Month will enter sharp, There will be more than the average precipitation for December 1882, and it is probable that most of this will come as snow, A well snowed in Christmas seems extremely probable, Last year there was no snow, There will be an early and severe ""cold snap,"" which will come from the Northwest, Shortly after the entry of the New Year there will probably be a decided let up in the weather, (issued in October) The year 1882 will close exceedingly stormy in the Western States and portions of Ontario and Quebec. - THE TEAM BEAT OF VERBUS, Good Observation at Winnipeg, The following telegram has just been received from Prof. McLeod, of McGill University: ""WINNIPEG, December 8"""

A short time ago a rumor was current that the bodies of two men, bearing marks of violence, had been discovered near the extreme limits of the town. In the county of Dorchester, the prosecution of an active inquiry into the truth of the rumor by Dr. Morrisette, the coroner of the District of Beauce, has failed so far to bring any conclusion to light. The rumor is that Brooks, clothing and shoe merchant, failed; liabilities $70,000, assets $10,000. The Telegraph from New York, December 11. The Attorney-General has granted to John C. Rieff and John G. Moore the right, as stockholders of the Western Union Telegraph Company, to join in the application of Joseph P. Greaves to bring suit in the name of the people to annul the charter of the Western Union Company. The President of the Mutual Union Telegraph Company authorizes a positive denial that any proposition towards leasing the lines of his company to the Western Union Telegraph Company has ever been made by any officer of his company, or by any person authorized to make such offer. He further denies the statements that his company is not earning its expenses, but says, on the contrary, the receipts are largely in excess of expenses, and have shown a gratifying increase every month of the company's existence.

There were ten courses and eight wines, and the table pyramid of flowers only cost $350. Among the company was Oscar Wilde, who delivered himself of a gastronomic discourse. All who did not leave the table are said to have enjoyed it hugely. Mr. Ward always devises his own menus and insists on sampling the soup before it is served. He makes more fuss over the proper temperature of the wine than an old lady over the birth of a new baby in the village. UNITED STATES CONGRESS. Educational grant. The Nicaragua canal. Railroad legislation. Political entertainments. Bankruptcy bill. Civil service reform. Washington, December 11. It is said that Saturday's session of the House and Senate was the first ever, within the recollection of the oldest employees at the Capitol, held on Saturday in the first week of a session of Congress. It is said the Democrats are not satisfied with the bill reported by the House Committee on Civil Service reform, and will move to substitute a copy of the Pendleton bill. It is understood in Democratic circles that the provision for competitive examinations should be an indispensable prerequisite to any measure they endorse. Washington, December 11. In the House, the committee on foreign affairs presented its views on the Nicaragua canal. Townsend's resolution referring to competing lines of railways was referred to committee. Vaughan introduced a resolution asking the Secretary of the Interior to state what railroads incorporated by Congress or aided by lands had failed to comply with the law respecting the construction and maintenance of their own telegraph lines for use of the Government and the public; also what contracts exist by which any such railroad leases or assigns telegraph property to telegraph companies so far as relates to the transmission of commercial messages for the Government and the public. Various monetary and revenue bills were introduced, also constitutional amendments relating to the method of the election of President, Vice-President, and members of Congress and defining their terms of office. After some business referring to the District of Columbia and discussion of local measures, the House adjourned. In the Senate, Hawley, from the committee on Civil Service, reported the bill preventing officers and employees of the Government from collecting subscriptions or assessments from each other. He stated he would offer this as an additional section to the Pendleton bill. The Senate took up the Bankruptcy bill, and after some discussion refused by a vote of 34 to 20 to postpone the matter, and by a vote of 34 to 30 adopted the Lowell bill as a substitute for the one reported from the Committee on Judiciary. Mr. Lowell's bill was sent to the Committee on Judiciary for revision. Mr. Pendleton moved to take up the Civil Service bill. The motion, after a few remarks, was carried, and the bill came up for discussion, but Mr. Pendleton agreed to its being temporarily laid aside, and the Senate took up the bill relative to certain Arkansas railroads; after which it went into executive session and confirmed a large number of nominations, including Gen. Pope and Col. Mackenzie to be major-general and brigadier-general. No contest was made upon any of them. Adjourned. The House committee on education agreed to a bill appropriating $10,000,000 a year for five years for educational purposes. The House Committee on Agriculture will report the Agricultural Appropriation Bill tomorrow; it appropriates $414,000,000, $130,000 less than last year. Items for tea-raising and experimental sugar-making are omitted. The sum for sending out garden seeds is reduced to $10,000. As finally agreed upon by the committee on the Post Office appropriation, the bill appropriates $43,948,000, or $605,000 less than for the current fiscal year.

Sir John Macdonald, it was expected, would be able to visit his office today, but owing to the blustering weather, he did not venture out. Sir John has so far recovered from his indisposition as to be able to leave his room. The Northern Light left Charlottetown last Sunday for Pictou, and was expected to return to Charlottetown or Georgetown yesterday. The Marine and Fisheries Department, however, gave no directions by telegraph yesterday to put her on her old route between Pictou and Georgetown, as there might be danger of her getting frozen in at Charlottetown at this late season of the year.

The Deputy Minister of Inland Revenue, Mr. Miall, is now in town, holding several important inquiries at the collectors' office. He intends to reform the excise office. The young man Alfred Mellette, who fell from the gallery of his three-storey house in St. Oliver Street, while throwing a snowball at a friend passing in the street, died last evening from the effects of his fall. Deceased was the son of the late Mr. Alfred Mellette, a well-known butcher of this city. Examinations at Laval University for the degrees of M."
"18821216","B, December 9, One of our comparatively new resources of natural wealth, and not the least profitable, is the smelt fishery of the North Shore. A few years ago these little fish were looked upon as worthless food for export purposes and were caught principally as manure for the land, many tons of them being placed in compost heaps every year. But the culinary virtues of the fish have been recognized at home, after it has been found to be in so great demand abroad, and railway communication and refrigerator cars have opened the way for the shipping of the smelt to all parts of the United States and Canada. The demand has grown, the facilities for transportation have increased and the supply of fish has shown a diminution. The season for taking the fish in nets is limited by law to the time between November 15th and February 15th, and the fishing is prosecuted through holes in the ice with bag nets at the end of long poles. Two or three men fish one hole. They have a little hut on the ice, in which they keep a fire, and make themselves as comfortable as possible. The mouth of the net is kept open by a hoop, and the current expands the body of it. The smelt, as they move up river in swarms from the sea, enter the open mouth and swim unsuspectingly into the cul-de-sac before them. The nets are raised and emptied pretty often, and sometimes they are so full as to be broken, an overabundance which, it will be remembered, once bothered even the Apostles when they were fishing. The fishery is carried on at night, and the lanterns of the fishermen have a weird look away out upon such wide swamps of ice as the lower Miramichi. This river is the chief seat of the smelt fishery, and the fishermen have just been enabled, by the formation of the ice, to launch their huts and get to work. They have been fishing for a few days, or rather nights, wherever the ice would bear them, but the cold of the last three or four days has closed the broad basins effectually. Sixty tons were taken just below Chatham, Thursday night, and an equal quantity Friday night. The average catch per man each night was over half a ton, and some men had two tons. One man and his boys took eight tons of these fish last week. The smelt are bought up by local merchants (nearly all of whom take a hand in the smelt business) and frozen and boxed immediately for shipment or storage. The fishermen get from one to three cents per pound, according to the size of their fish, the state of the weather, and the market, and many of them will make $200 or $300 during the six weeks from the making of ice to the close of the season. The dealers, profiting by some of their past experience, have combined for the purpose of preventing a glut in the market, and are already storing more fish than they are shipping. Last year all the fish catch was sent to market, a thaw set in, and their consignments were sold at ruinous rates. More attention is now paid also to smaller cities and towns, and an agent has been sent out to arrange for the shipment of smelts to all the places of any importance along the lines of railway between St. John and New York. The old custom was to send all the fish to Boston and New York, and allow the dealers there to send them back to Portland, Bangor and elsewhere. The consumption of the fish has increased very much in our own towns, and smelt are growing in demand everywhere as a winter delicacy and Lenten necessity. The catch is to be hereafter frozen, stored and shipped with due regard to the weather and the market; in fact, handled as systematically as the salmon catch. Tommy-cods, young bass and the young of other fish are found with the smelt, but experience has enabled the fishermen to avoid the places where the young bass are liable to be caught in large numbers. Bass is altogether too valuable a fish to destroy in its infancy, as the fishermen get ten cents a pound for it, usually, both in the summer and winter seasons. It is fished through the ice in winter, in somewhat the same way as smelt, the fishermen moving around the holes with the net pole in such a way as to ensure the catching of the fish that enter. The size of the meshes is regulated by law, and there are officers on the alert to confiscate all nets which are not in accordance with the regulations. One is shown, on a visit to any Fishery Overseer's store, a large collection of confiscated nets. Fines are imposed and licenses canceled in some cases, but too many of the offenders escape punishment. It is strange that men who virtually own a valuable fishing privilege, as the people who live near the bass fishing grounds do, and look forward to it for winter employment in the future, are foolish enough to be willing to destroy it by catching the young fish which are not worth one-quarter as much as they will sell for if allowed to remain in the water a year or two; but such is human nature. The most radical of philosophers, filled with lofty theories of the right of all men to perfect liberty of action, would cry out for repressive legislation at the sight of people fishing in bass waters with smelt nets. A little observation of the habits of man in general, when left to do as he will, upsets a whole system of philosophy evolved from the inner consciousness of a reasonable human being who is united with the desire to do right, and teaches that the curtailment of the liberty of the individual is the only safety of the community and of posterity. Some perverse critic may misconstrue this, and denounce your correspondent as a Tory who preaches against personal liberty and in favor of governmental tyranny, but he will be much mistaken in the forming of such an opinion. Till Cedar Grove disaster was the cause of great excitement here. The steamer was the pioneer of St. John line; she was owned here, and great expectations had been formed upon the supposition that she would soon have enough to establish a fortnightly line. The people felt proprietary interest in her. She was visited, when here, by as many people as boarded the ironclad Northampton during her stay in our harbor, and her loss, apart altogether from the loss of life that attended it, was the cause of the most general and profound regret. Capt. Frita was buried yesterday, during a snowstorm, and there was a very large attendance of citizens. It has not been decided yet what the company will do, whether it will buy a steamship and go on with the building of one for which the plans had been made before the loss of the Cedar Grove, or dissolve. The probability is that the company will build another ship, whether it buys one now or not. The sale of the Princess Royal Railway has been effected and the money paid. The woods and stock were chiefly owned here, and the price obtained is looked upon like a run drawn in a lottery, as little or nothing was expected out of the railway. The purchasers, English capitalists, will relay the road with steel rails, extend it to deeper water, build a wharf, supply the road with proper rolling stock, and open the coal mine belonging to the company unless they succeed in their project of buying out the Spring Hill Coal Mining Company. They made an offer to the gentlemen who own the controlling interest, but better terms were demanded, and the purchase may not be effected. The Spring Hill property is principally owned here, provincial lines having proved no barrier to St. John enterprise when the mine was placed on the market. It has been paying 7 percent on a capital stock that is considerably larger than it should be, the proprietors having been given too much paid-up stock for their rights, and the shares are not to be had at much less than par. The chief owners are men of money, taking a keen personal interest in the management, and are full of faith in the extent of the deposit and the paying qualities of the mine. Prices have been raised of late, and the demand is greater than the supply. The slack coal of this mine is granular in character, and not mere dust, like most slack coal, and is used almost entirely by the St. John and Moncton manufacturing establishments and sugar refinery, whose managers say they want nothing better for steam purposes. This is one of the great advantages our manufacturers have, as this quality of coal costs only a dollar a ton on board the cars at the mine. One of our principal manufacturers says he wouldn't give a button for water power when he can get Spring Hill slack coal at his factory for so low a figure as at present."
"18821221","WEEKLY REVIEW OF THE PERIOD AND PROVISION MARKET Montreal, December 20 During a number of days past, the weather in this city and vicinity in the daytime has been slightly cold, but not extremely so, the highest registered temperature since last Friday, being 22° on 18th inst., and the lowest 30° on 10th inst., the average mean of five days being 10°. The ice-bridge across the river St. Lawrence appears to be forming earlier than usual; and teams are reported to have been passing over, at some distance below Montreal. The snowstorm which occurred towards the end of last week was the occasion of some delay to railway travel and traffic, nearly all trains being impeded. Since then, snow has fallen every day, more or less, and the roads in town and country are in good order for sleighing. Farmers and others are now making good use of the facilities thus afforded, and the retail produce markets, as well as the retail trade generally, are brisk. The poultry and egg markets are kept well cleared by buyers from the United States, and high prices are the result.

It is said considerable veal of this description has been shipped to New York. THE OIL MARKET The price of crude petroleum in Pennsylvania ran down to 78½ per barrel yesterday, wiping out further margins and causing irreparable ruin to many a seeker after fortune in oil speculation. The further decline in values has resulted in some heavy failures, advices from Bradford, Pa., stating that one speculator lost $10,000, and a lady speculator who has been carrying 20,000 barrels purchased at $1.20 has been compelled to sell 4,000 barrels to carry the margin. Now the news comes that the City Bank of Rochester has suspended through the heavy losses of the President of the Bank, Mr. Upton, who used $350,000 of the Bank's funds in oil speculation. It is said he was carrying at one time 200,000 barrels on his own account besides speculating for other firms. The market today, which broke away to 78¢, created the wildest excitement yet experienced, but it rallied somewhat at the close to 81¢.

"18830122","MY PARTNER On Wednesday evening next Aldrich & Parsloe open in My Partner, concerning which, though the play has already been seen here, we may quote the New York AW as to its performance at the Union Square Theatre: My Partner is entitled to much praise for its strong, pure, no surly, its intense situations, and its forcible but natural presentation of California scenes and California life. My Partner is distinctly original throughout. Mr. Campbell's use of material shows decided variations in construction, and a great deal of the earnestness and feeling which are indispensable in good work. The acting throughout was unusually good. The attempts to make the personages distinct and unlike were very successfully carried out by both playwright and players. The two partners were wholly unlike in their temperament, character and language, and indeed, in everything but the effects produced by the same environment. The remorse, terror, pity and grief of Joe, as manifested by Mr. Aldrich, betokened no mean art. MORE WEATHER FOR VENNOR'S ROOM Well, Vennor in all right; his prediction has come true. The warm weather between the 6th and the 8th actually came. It was a little late this time, delaying it until the night of the 9th to twain, but that was owing to his dropping a cooler when hurried. In the throng up here, people said to Nat, ""Oh, Vennor has ruined it this time,"" and seemed to chuckle over it, but now they laugh on the other side of the fence. Vennor has made a great deal of the hardest man in Bucks County, and we can hear him make smiles all the way from Punxsutawney. We hope there is no collusion between Aaron and Vennor. Douleittown Democrat, PA Our hills are now fairly alive with coasters of both sexes, and they imagine they have good times. It would hardly be right to undeceive them. Friday morning, Field-Marshal Kratz's train passed through Doylestown loaded with sleighs, going south, where the most snow fell. NEWTON NOTES During the past week the owners of trotters have had their wishes gratified, in regard to sleighing, and daily State Street has been alive with teams, and so far no one has been fined. Winter is fairly with us now. Vennor's entry January has come. Snow set in on Tuesday night, continuing on and on until about Thursday noon, and closing with a total fall of six inches. With sunshine yesterday afternoon, a cold wave came, the mercury rapidly falling, and this Friday morning, January the 12th, we find it at zero. Plenty of work in the stone quarries, but the stormy and excessive cold weather interrupts it. Center Bridge, Bucks Co., PA Quite a snowstorm prevailed in this section on Wednesday, the 10th instant. Sleighing may now be indulged in without fear of striking bare ground. Vennor is sure to get out all right if left unmolested. Science and common sense have heretofore prevailed, and will in the present and future. One grand law pervades the universe; one master mind guides the helm; and whenever science once fully comprehends these laws, success will be attained. DURHAM AND BRISTOL, PA The snow I wrote of last week did not amount to very much, but the one that followed, commencing on Tuesday and lasting until Thursday morning, is the biggest snow of the season, and has made very excellent sleighing, which is being taken advantage of by everybody who can get a horse or sleigh. It is quite remarkable that with the heavy fall of snow, accompanied with exceeding cold weather, the river up to the time this is written has not been frozen up. MARKETOWN NOTES Contrary to expectations we now have good sleighing, and as cold as Greenland; in some places there is very little snow on account of the high winds prevailing at the time. Sleighing parties are now in vogue. Our ice houses have nearly all been filled this week with a very good quality of ice. The elegant sleighing brought out a number of people, who are taking advantage of it. JARDLEYVILLE, PA Now that the transit of Venus and the comet are things of the past, there seems little for newspaper correspondents to write about; but they have been well commented upon, and the subject should be allowed to rest. The snowstorm predicted by Vennor was a little late in coming, but has left the ground well covered with snow. It is hoped the thaw predicted to follow it will keep off long enough to allow each and every one to get a sleigh ride. Your correspondent can fully sympathize with News-About-Town, in having the bells without the sleigh. Chicago (Farmer's Review) January has been kind to Mr. Vennor and proportionately unkind to the frost-bitten, shivering denizens of this portion of the earth. Severe cold, blustering winds and heavy snows have so far marked the opening month of the new year. In Virginia rivers are frozen and sleighing is going on, and even from the Golden Horn comes the news of heavy snow. A private letter to the manager of the Review from Solano Co., California, says: ""From Sunday morning (Dec 31), until now (the evening of Jan 1) we have had a steady fall of snow, which now lies 18 inches thick on the ground; it is really a wonderful and beautiful sight to see the bright red roses and green leaves peeping out from the heap of snow."" January 18th, E. Inland than to go West to the great prairies. There is no denying the fact that the winters of the Northwest are colder than those of the Maritime Provinces. Winter sets in early, and in nearly the whole country it is very constant; but spring opens generally ten or fourteen days earlier than on the Island. The heat in summer is pretty much the same as with us by the sea. The extreme of heat at midday is occasionally riper than it is here, but not more so than in the interior part of the neighboring provinces. The nights in the Northwest, even in the warmest weather, are for the most part pleasantly cool. Over the whole of what is called the fertile belt of our Northwest the difference of temperature is inconsiderable. The remote southwest of the prairie country on the Canadian side of the boundary, or what is generally termed by travelers ""the Bow River country,"" has a more variable winter than any other part of the fertile belt. There occasionally a south to southwest wind, called in the country ""a chinook,"" blows for a time, and causes a very sudden rise in the temperature. This wind is supposed by some to come either across the mountain plateau, where the great chain of the Rockies is somewhat broken south of the line, or by a circuit from the Gulf of Mexico along the eastern side of the mountains. This ""chinook"" causes any snow that may be on the ground to disappear very suddenly. Hence the reason that the Bow River country is the best portion of the Territories for raising stock, as, owing to the absence of snow, cattle can feed out all winter. Snowstorms, of course, occasionally occur, and for a few days the herds may have rather a difficult time in procuring their food. On this account, it is always prudent for the careful rancher to have on hand a few stacks of hay. Still, upon the whole, these seasons of deep snow are so seldom that the expense of laying up hay for the whole winter, as in most other parts of Canada, is obviated.

(Applause) The only way to meet Home Rule and a dissolution of the union was by treating the Irish people as we would treat ourselves. (Renewed applause) The extension of household suffrage to Ireland, however, must depend upon the state of that country at the time the new reform bills are introduced. DUBLIN, January 26, Twenty-one prisoners arraigned last Saturday on a charge of conspiracy to murder Government officers, will be examined tomorrow. The investigation will be held in Kilmainham Court House, as the Government fears the prison van might be attacked. The Court House is guarded by military. It is reported astounding disclosures will be made as regards the Phoenix murders, and the evidence will completely eclipse last Saturday's. A Dublin despatch says there is an underground passage between Kilmainham Court House and jail, so that no communication between the prisoners and their friends is possible during the transit from the jail to the Court House. No doubt exists that the prisoners' friends are greatly exasperated at the information the Government has received and will avail themselves of any opportunity to take vengeance. London, January 26, It is stated that, in the event of Davitt, Healy and Quinn refusing to give bail, they will probably be sentenced to solitary confinement and hard labour in Kilmainham jail. They will certainly not be treated as first-class inmates. Neither Davitt, Healy nor Quinn will give bail; they will consequently go to prison.

Visitors during the week have been treated to all varieties of Canadian winter weather, with the exception of the most objectionable, viz., a thaw, which, so much to be dreaded, was kept at a safe distance by the kindly offices of Jack Frost. The blustery snowstorm of Saturday was a taste of what can be done in that direction, and, though severe, did not prevent a large attendance at the Tandem Club drive. The drive was one of the most successful ever held by the Club and excited the admiration and surprise of all spectators, in spite of their having been already treated to two drives of greater magnitude during the week. The display of horses, trappings, and sleighs by the Club was exceedingly fine throughout, from the magnificent four-in-hand, which led, to the toboggan driven by Mr. Colin Campbell, which was an admirable feature of the turnout.

The market for native hides continues fairly steady at the late decline, but we hear of complaints of the poor condition in which some lots are being received. Several good-sized lots have been taken by tanners during the past few days, who consider them good property at present low prices. Owing to the cheapness of green butchers' hides, Western green salted are comparatively neglected, and business therein is very light. There is no change in prices, however, since our last review. We quote prices as follows: Green butchers' at 7c, 6c, and 5c per lb, for Nos 1, 2, and 3 respectively, tanners paying 1c more for inspected. Western hides, No 1 buff at 9c to 9½c per lb, and No 2 at 8c to 8½c; second steers at 10c to 10½c, and bulls at 6c to 6½c; dry salted Western, 17c for No 1 and 15c for No 2; sheep skins, $1.05 to $1.15 each, and calf skins 12c per lb. Very few furs have been received during the week, and what few lots of red fox are coming in meet with rather dull sale at somewhat easier rates, $1.25 being the top figure for good lots. The local demand is over for the season, and arrivals have now to depend upon the foreign outlet. Advices just received from New York advise caution in the buying of marten, mink, and fox. We quote: Mink, $1.00; red fox, $1.00 to $1.25; marten, $1.00; otter, $8 to $10; beaver, $2 to $2.50 per lb; skunk, 60c; bear, $8 to $10 for large and $4 to $5 for small; lynx, $2 to $2.50. Stocks of foreign wool in this market are pretty well concentrated, being nearly all in the hands of one or two firms. A fair demand is reported for greasy Cape, with sales at within range of our quotations. A few parcels of Australian have also been taken by manufacturers. Canada pulled wools are quiet but steady. We quote prices as follows: Greasy Cape, 17½c to 19c; Australian, 20c to 31c as to quality; Canadian pulled Supers, 30c to 33c. Stocks in yards continue to show a gradual reduction, and as more cold weather appears to be at hand, a further impetus will no doubt be given to the demand. Prices remain very firm with no prospect of any immediate change in favor of the buying interest. Any alteration is more likely to be in the opposite direction. We quote prices as follows: Anthracite, stove and chestnut firm, at $7.50 per net ton delivered and $7.25 for egg; Scotch ex yard at $6.75 to $7.00; Newcastle smiths' at $6.75 to $7.25; Heltons at $7.50 to $8.00; Lower Ports at $4.50 to $5.00. A fair local inquiry exists for both hard and soft woods and former values are generally well sustained. There is also an American demand for pine for spring shipment and hard woods for immediate delivery. Dealers report the outlook for the coming year's business as very encouraging. The weather has been all that could be wished for lumbering operations in the woods and a heavy cut of logs is already reported. Prices in this market are quoted as follows from the yards: Pine, 1st quality per M, $35 to $14; pine, 2nd do, $22 to $24; pine, shipping culls, per M, $14 to $16; pine, 4th quality deals, per M, $11 to $12; pine, mill culls, per M, $10 to $12; spruce, per M, $10 to $13; hemlock, per M, $9 to $10; ash, run of log culls out, per M, $20 to $25; bass, do do, per M, $16 to $20; oak, per M, $10 to $50; walnut, per M, $70 to $100; cherry, per M, $60; butternut, per M, $35 to $40; birch, per M, $20 to $25; hard maple, per M, $25 to $30; lath, per M, $1.75; shingles, 1st, per M, $3.00; shingles, 2nd, per M, $2.50.

Low temperatures were experienced on the 26th and 27th ult; a drifting snowstorm occurred on the latter date, and was the precursor of higher registrations than those of the preceding eight or ten days. A dense fog enshrouded this city during the morning of the 29th ult; again on the night of the 30th, and continued until yesterday forenoon, followed by rain, sleet, and snow, there being a difference of 48° between that and the minimum of Friday last. There has, of course, been a rapid thaw.

"18830208","U, 1, (11 Ml, U, 3fttl4, KM 1 st $9 v$10 per ton - iii rli tr Mostk4l, February 7 Exporta In reviewing the wholesale trade of the past week it is impossible to ignore the fact that the increased number of failures has created a feeling of uneasiness and distrust in some quarters, but it is equally true that these disturbing elements in the situation, resulting in many instances from overtrading, underselling, and the indiscriminate granting of credits, have already led to the adoption of a more conservative policy on the part of wholesale men in opening new lines of credit, which shows a determination on the part of our leading firms to discourage, as much as possible, the tendency to foster too keen competition. Cases have come under our notice today, in which firms with limited means, applying for credits, have been absolutely refused, as the parties who received the applications deemed it unwise to open new stores in districts which already had their complement of traders. It would appear by this, that in lieu of wholesale houses pressing goods upon retailers, as has been alleged, the very reverse obtains. We are pleased to observe this caution on the part of wholesale dealers, which, if generally practiced, will not only be the means of averting much trouble in the future, but will tend to restore confidence, which has to some extent been shaken by the recent insolvencies. Perhaps somewhat undue importance has been attached to late developments in business difficulties from the fact that we have enjoyed such a protracted period of immunity from such occurrences. We have made careful inquiries of prominent houses in the leading department of the wholesale trade in this city, regarding the general condition of business, its present status, the outlook for the coming spring and summer trade, payments, etc., and we have arrived at the conclusion that there is not the slightest foundation for questioning the general stability of the great commercial interests of the country. Although business has been considerably checked by the recent snowstorms throughout the country, causing travelers in the northern sections of Upper Canada to be blockaded for periods of four and five days, the amount of orders coming in compares favorably with that at the corresponding dates last year. The paper maturing on the 6th instant was fairly well met, there being much less renewing than was expected. Merchants complain of the difficulty they experience in selling Canadian cottons, as customers prefer English makes containing 20 to 25 percent less pure cotton than the home manufactured goods. Why the English cottons are heavier than Canadian is owing, it is said, to there being a much larger proportion of starch in them than in the latter. Cottons are quiet, and values rule easy, and as production increases lower prices are confidently looked for, hence the refusal of buyers to anticipate their wants to any extent. Iron and Hardware, there is a general feeling of weakness in the pig iron trade, in sympathy with the situation in the United States and Great Britain. Stocks here are light and only barely sufficient to meet present wants. Cartiherrie has changed hands at $26.50, and Caldonit $20.00 in car lots. Coltness is scarce and quoted at $27.00 and Kglinton at $23.00 to $23.25. For spring shipment, however, much lower prices would be accepted. Scotch warrants are cabled at 47s-6d. Bar iron is quiet but steady at $2.15 to $2.25 with sales at both figures, although we hear that the inside figure has been shaded for a round quantity. Tubes are quiet, and prices are about as last quoted. Societies being in attendance in regalia, and the sacred edifice being filled with friends of the society. The services were opened by the Rev.

At the close of the instruction the officers of the various societies renewed their pledges, their example being followed by about one hundred others. The proceedings were concluded with a solemn benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and blessing with the ashes. The collection taken up was for the benefit of the poor of the parish. This society is now one of the most prominent and influential of our Catholic temperance societies, and we bespeak for it a continued success in the noble work for which it is organized, the suppression of intemperance.

"18830216","(US) 111! t)H Railways 714,000 The first natural inference is that during and before the period of emigration referred to there was great acceleration of the rate of increase in population. Physiologically speaking, there is no historical record of a sudden spate of this nature; and the only conclusion which can be come to is that simultaneously with a pressure of the population upon the limits of subsistence there was a reduction of the available means of support. The theory of the Duke is that there was a removal of many checks upon their increase, and this, with the acquisition of a new and abundant food, caused the people of the Highlands to multiply rapidly during the latter half of the eighteenth century. There is no historical proof of this, and it is merely an adaptation of facts to principles which is hardly deserving of comment. The emigration which, it is said, has been the theme of so much natural but ill-formed complaint, is not to be explained away by any theory based upon a belief that the Malthusian laws were suddenly abandoned in the Highlands. In another portion of this article a consideration of the devotion of land to sheep-grazing is entered into. It is averred that tillage has not been decreasing, but, on the contrary, has been increasing, and that enormously. Elsewhere the Duke affirms that no fertile land is being given up to sheep, but that the conversion of the mountains into sheep-grazings was as much a reclamation of waste lands as if the whole of that vast surface had been for the first time reclaimed from the sea. The correctness of this argument regarding the conversion of hill-country into grazing land is illustrated clearly by the prosperity of the Border counties, where sheep farming on a large scale has long been established, and the extent of arable land is small compared with the mountain pasture. The movement, therefore, in the direction of establishing grazing grounds in place of tilled land is one in the direction of prosperity. The Duke declares that it was nothing but the poverty, ignorance and barbarism of the Highlanders alone which had prevented a similar system of agriculture being sooner adopted there. It is difficult, however, to compare the Highland mountains to the Cheviot hills with any prospect of credence. Nature, it is affirmed, has pointed out the agricultural uses to which the Highlands are specially adapted. Though the description of the Western mountains of great elevation as being covered to the top with a rich and luxuriant vegetation is certainly overdrawn, there are certain other facts overlooked in this article which bear out the argument more fully. The Western Highlands have practically little snow compared to the Border Counties. The heavy snowstorms which necessitate special provision for sheep-feeding during the winter months are unknown in the West, and though the moss of the Lowland hills is not found in the Northwest, there is generally a sufficiency of grazing to enable the sheep to live through the spring months. The attempts of the Western Highlanders to confine their labor to tillage of unproductive ground could only result in a recurrence of famines and constant destitution. Their primitive conception of land treatment did not go further than that of many starving land grubbers in Ireland, and the reclamation of bogs which were essayed in such places as Lewis were always complete failures. The Border Counties at first sight appear certainly more suitable for tillage than the Highland mountains; and yet non-recognition of the most fundamental laws of agriculture prevented the Highland Crofters from knowing that their efforts to force such land to produce grain could only be futile. While all the land which is capable of production is being retained, the devotion of the remainder of the country to grazing purposes is neither an infringement of moral laws nor of economic principles. The Duke of Argyle fails to give more than a partial view of the question, for the possibilities of the Western fishings are not sufficiently described. The population which will become surplus when the land becomes devoted to its natural uses will not require to take refuge in emigration when the fisheries of the West coast are developed to the point of which they are capable.

Tonight the wind is higher than it has been all day, but there has been no approach to a storm, though snow fell to a considerable depth during Saturday night. Some excitement was created yesterday afternoon when telegrams were received stating that severe gales and a tidal wave had occurred on the coast of Nova Scotia and the eastern coast of the United States, and in consequence, Wiggins' stock went up, but it had a downward tendency tonight. Mr. Wiggins claims Saturday's snowstorm as part of his great blow. IN THE EASTERN TOWNSHIPS AN EARTHQUAKE Waterville, Que, March 11, The severest storm known for years is in progress today. Snow began falling yesterday afternoon and continued unabated through the night. The wind has been blowing a gale all day, and the snow is piled almost mountains high, making traffic of all kinds absolutely impossible. It will take some days to clear the snow blockade so that business may resume its normal condition. The mayor is engaging a large force of men to open the streets. Between 10 and 11 o'clock two distinct shocks of earthquake were felt, the wave passing from east to west, and causing great alarm. The country roads will be impassable for days. The mails between here and Magog are to be carried by team, trains being cancelled. In the meantime, the Central Vermont and Southern railways are making almost superhuman efforts to get their lines open. Wiggins was regarded as rank on Saturday, and today he is looked upon as indeed a prophet of the prophets. St. Johns, Que, March 11, There was a heavy snowstorm last night and part of today, the wind approaching a gale at 2 PM. Two shocks of earthquake, following each other, were felt at 10:57 this morning, and a third at 11:07. During the first hopes were entertained of the prospects of a new railway station, for which Prof. Wiggins would receive the thanks of the whole community. The storm has abated, and it is gradually growing colder. AN1, WEMBLEY, March 10, The twenty-fifth snowstorm of the season is raging tonight. It is the heaviest storm this season.

It caused a fresh or heavy gale at most places in eastern Canada, accompanied by rain in Nova Scotia and a snowstorm in Quebec and New Brunswick. The weather has now cleared in the Maritime Provinces, and it has been generally fine and colder in Ontario, and very fine over the greater portion of the continent. Storm signals were ordered up at all ocean ports on Saturday morning, and lowered on Sunday."

Representations having been made to the British Government Foreign Office, it is said they have telegraphed instructions to land forcibly if necessary. A stricken town, Forest City, Cal, March 17. The fire on Friday destroyed the entire business portion of the town. Hundreds of people are homeless in the streets. Scarcely anything was saved. Many barely escaped with their lives. There are no provisions in town except what is contained in Heintzm's fireproof cellar, which is safe. One thousand pounds of flour is said to be all that is saved. Much suffering must ensue before the destitute can be provided for. Only a few small buildings on the outskirts of the town are left. The Bald Mountain Company's mining buildings, dump, lumber house, lumber yards, and flume are all safe. This renders it possible for many of the poor to go to work as soon as they get housed. Seventy-six buildings were burned, with an estimated loss of $50,000. The insurance is believed to be quite small. A gang of Chinamen stole half of the flour left, and organized bodies of men are now starting to exclude or drive them from the town. The people were provided with some food and shelter last night, but all the teams are gone, and any hour may bring a snowstorm, preventing all communication. No lumber is to be had until teams can be brought from the valleys. The fire originated in the kitchen of the Forest House. The water works were insufficient and the fire apparatus in bad condition.

LeUolne, of Spencer Orange, Quebec, gives the following interesting account of an incident which came under his observation: Chance made me today the witness of an occurrence which may, perhaps, be worthy of notice in your journal. Yesterday a frail boat of only twelve feet keel, manned by two vigorous young Canadians, arrived at Bio after a successful passage with oars alone from Mill Vaches on the north side. The distance is at least twenty-one cities; it is well known how chequered the river is with ice in the month of February. I questioned Mr. Napoleon iJlaricint, one of those intrepid adventurers, as to the dangers of such a voyage; he replied as if the undertaking was a matter of course, and told me that in the following week he was preparing to cross from the south side at Portneuf to the north side, where the distance from shore to shore is still greater. Are you not afraid, I asked him, of a snowstorm or gale of wind arising during so long a passage, and that your vessel would be bound adrift? You have not any sails, nothing but simple oars to take you across. He said in reply: We select a time of fair weather, and leave the rest to Providence. What a true type, I said to myself, of the Canadian of the days of old! When D'Iberville set out in April two centuries ago for Hudson's Bay, perhaps the forefather of Napoleon lIanuhet was one of his crew. At any rate, he ought to have been. Bio, or, as Champlain named it on the 20th of May, 1603, the I'lo, is a place as celebrated in our history as it is picturesque. Where is the Canadian mariner who does the lllo, Blquot, the Cap Enrage, the lie ikrulee, Cap a l'Urlgual, the lie au Masnaore and the Aloide Legend, during the time of Jean Alpuonso de tlntouge? Bio was called Qf 4 Murbre. Jacques Cartier, in 1535, gave to Bio Harbour the name of Isle aux Saint Jean, because it was on the anniversary of that saint's beheading that he entered it. The Baron d'Avangotir, in 1715, and thirty years later the celebrated Vauban, assigned to Bio an important role in their plan of defense for the consolidation of French power in Canada. In 1861 Bio helped to maintain British power by furnishing the Allan steamship Persia a place to disembark the English troops, who, with our native militia, had the charge of vindicating the honor of our flag, commanded by Wilkes. Who knows but in the future still more important role may be reserved for us? THE BIIALSA BOHIMS.

The merchants claim that there is an evident necessity for increased protection this year, as aside from the announced intention of the ship laborers to hold out for higher wages and their determination not to give in to their demands, which may result in trouble, the accommodation of the harbour is being increased and the force at its present strength is not adequate to the protection of the shipping along the extended line of wharves. Trains Delayed. The heavy snowstorms of the last day or two have seriously impeded the train service, and most of the trains have been greatly delayed. The Western yesterday morning was six hours late, and the New York trains on the Vermont Central and Delaware & Hudson, about three hours.

Qristc, March 20. In the Private Bills this morning consideration of the Montreal bill was postponed until tomorrow, owing to the non-arrival of an important deputation, known to be on board the delayed North Shore train. There were no meetings of the Committees on Privileges and Elections, Railways and Public Accounts owing to the absence of quorums in consequence of the late hour at which the House adjourned this morning. Seven or eight witnesses, summoned from Montmagny, were, however, in attendance on the first-named committee to give evidence in the petition matter, the investigation into which was adjourned until tomorrow. Owing to the snowstorm, Crown Lands Commissioner Lynch was only able to leave this morning for K now 1 tori to attend his father's funeral. The Premier intends to move a resolution respecting the employment of official stenographers. He has also given notice of certain resolutions respecting railways. The possibility of proroguing this week is no longer in question, the Premier virtually admitting, towards the close of tonight's sitting, that the necessities of business still before the House might necessitate the prolongation of the session into next week. FROM QUEBEC. Personal matters here rally. Mr. Graham of the Montreal & Toronto. The snowstorm of last night and this morning has interrupted railway communication. Two mail trains are fast in the sand at Three Rivers. The English mail per S.S. Circassian, at Halifax, and the western mails per Grand Trunk were delivered here at 4:30 p.m. The storm is said to be the worst of the season. The Lower Town Street Railway Company carried more passengers last year than in any year since they have been running.

He died within a few hours. Advice from Voreplg state that the long Nercpll bridge, at the mouth of the river, was carried away yesterday. Sections of the bridge are standing, and the ice piled so high that it is impossible to see across the river from this point. The cost of the bridge was in the vicinity of $33,000. The ice in the Kennebunk River was broken loose above Bloomfield by the flood of Tuesday and ran down into the basin, jamming up against the Bloomfield Bridge; the water falling, however, and no damage to the bridge is anticipated. Yesterday morning, in the vicinity of Sussex, on the Dutch Valley road, the water was from one to four feet deep.

Several barns and shops were moved from their foundations and broken up, and others were badly damaged. A number of families have been compelled to desert their homes. An Annapolis despatch says that a freshet has carried away one mill dam and part of another. The rush of water, ice, and logs has partly destroyed the bridge at Lequillo, two and a half miles from the town. Fatal Fire Danville, March 23.

New York, March 23. The Sun's Washington despatch says it is reported that Minister West has informed the State Department that Lord Granville has instructed him to say that the violent expressions of certain professed United States citizens since the dynamite explosion in London may disturb the amicable relations of the two governments. West, when questioned, would not admit this, but the Government has been notified of such instruction to him, but he said that the British Government could do no less than take cognizance of the utterances of Rossa and others, and he had expected some such instruction from Lord Granville. Mr. Frolitton was non-committal and believed some communication had just passed between the British Minister and the State Department, but had reason to doubt if it took anything like the menacing form ascribed by rumor. Washington, March 23. Secretary Frelinghuysen, being questioned this afternoon regarding the alleged representations of the British Government concerning the utterances of Irish sympathizers, said: ""The relations between the two countries were never more cordial, and better understanding never existed. I do not see the slightest reason to apprehend that those relations will be impaired."" Assistant Secretary Davis said: ""It is no doubt very annoying to the English Government and people, to feel that men are harboring in another country, and to some extent encouraged in their sympathy with and direct aid to assassins and dynamite plotters who are giving them so much trouble, but the Government can deal only with facts and act under the law as they stand upon the statute book.""

"18830718","THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, WEDNESDAY, THE HIDDEN HAND, BY MR. SOUTHWORTH, AUTHOR OF THE BOOK OF AMERICAN NOVELS, THE DESK AT THE WIKS, CHAPTER 1, THE KNOCKING VISIT, Whence is that knocking? How is it that every sound appalls me? I hear a knocking in the south entry! Hark! More knocking! HURRICANE HALL, is a large old family mansion, built of dark red sandstone, in one of the loneliest and wildest of the mountain regions of Virginia. The estate is surrounded on three sides by a range of steep gray rocks, spiked with clumps of dark evergreens, and called, from its horse-shoe form, the Devil's Hoof. On the fourth side, the ground gradually descends in broken rock and barren soil to the edge of the wild mountain stream known as the Devil's Run. When storms and floods were high, the loud roaring of the wind through the wild mountain gorges, and the terrific raging of the torrent over its rocky course, gave to this savage locality its ill-fated names of Devil's Hoof, Devil's Run, and Hurricane Hall. Major Ira Warfield, the lonely proprietor of the Hall, was a veteran officer, who, in disgust at what he supposed to be ill-requited services, had retired from public life to spend the evening of his vigorous age on this his patrimonial estate. Here he lived in seclusion, with his old-fashioned housekeeper, Mrs. Condiment, and his old family servants, and his favorite dogs and horses. In person, Major Warfield was tall and strongly built, like some iron-limbed Douglas of the olden time. In character, Major Warfield was arrogant, domineering, and violent; equally loved and feared by his faithful old family servants at home, disliked and dreaded by his neighbors and acquaintances abroad, who, partly from his house, and partly from his character, fixed upon him the appropriate nickname of Old HURRICANE. There was, however, other ground of aversion besides that of his arrogant mind, violent temper, and domineering habits. Old Hurricane was said to be an old bachelor, yet rumor whispered that there was in some obscure part of the world, hidden away from human sight, a deserted wife and child, poor, forlorn, and heart-broken. It was further whispered that the older brother of Ira Warfield had mysteriously disappeared, and not without some suspicion of foul play on the part of the only person in the world who had a strong interest in his taking off. However these things might be, it was known for a certainty that Old Hurricane had an only sister, widowed, sick, and poor, who, with her son, dragged on a wretched life of ill-requited toil, severe privation, and painful infirmity, in a distant city, unaided, unsought, and uncared for by her cruel brother. It was the night of the last day of October, eighteen hundred and forty-five. The evening had closed in dark and gloomy. About dusk, the wind arose in the northwest, driving up masses of leaden-hued clouds, and in a few minutes the ground was covered deep with snow, and the air was filled with driving sleet. Upon this evening, then, there was left at the hall only Major Warfield, Mrs. Condiment, his little housekeeper, and Wool, his body-servant. Early in the evening, the old house was shut up closely to keep out as much as possible the sound of the storm that roared through the mountain chasms, and cannonaded the walls as if determined to force an entrance. As soon as she had seen that all was right, Mrs. Condiment went to bed and to sleep. It was about ten o'clock that night that Old Hurricane, wrapped in his quilted flannel dressing-gown, sat in his padded arm-chair before a warm and bright fire, taking his ease in his own bedroom. This was the hour of the coziest enjoyment to the self-indulgent Sybarite. And, indeed, every means and appliance of bodily comfort was at hand. Strong oaken shutters and thick, heavy curtains at the windows kept out every draft of air, and so deadened the sound of the wind that its subdued moaning was just sufficient to remind one of the stormy weather without in contrast to the bright warmth within. Old Hurricane, as I said, sat well wrapped up in his wadded dressing-gown, reclining in his padded easy chair, with his head thrown back, and his feet upon the fire-irons, toasting his shins and sipping his punch. On his left hand stood his cozy bedstead, with its warm crimson curtains festooned back, revealing the luxurious swell of the full feather bed, and pillows with their snow-white linen and lambswool blankets inviting repose. Between this bedstead and the corner of the fireplace stood Old Hurricane's ancient body-servant, Wool, engaged in warming a crimson cloth night-cap. ""I take this,"" said Old Hurricane, as he sipped his punch and smacked his lips, ""I take this to be the very quintessence of human enjoyment, sitting here in my soft warm chair before the fire, toasting my legs, sipping my punch, listening on the one hand to the storm without, and glancing on the other hand at my comfortable bed waiting there to receive my sleepy head."" ""I wonder now if there is anything on the face of the earth that would tempt me to leave my cozy fireside and go abroad tonight? I wonder how large a promise of pleasure or profit or glory would it take now?"" ""Much as ever Congress itself could give if it gave you a penance for all your servants,"" suggested Wool. ""Yes, and more! For I wouldn't leave my home comforts tonight to insure not only the pension but the thanks of Congress,"" said the old man, replenishing his glass with steaming punch and drinking it off leisurely. The clock struck eleven. The old man again filled his glass, and, while sipping its contents, said: ""You may fill the warming-pan and warm my bed, Wool. The fumes of this fragrant punch are beginning to rise to my head and make me sleepy."" The servant filled the warming-pan with glowing embers, shut down the lid, and thrust it between the sheets, to heat the couch of the luxurious Old Hurricane. The old man continued to toast his feet, sip his punch, and smack his lips. He finished his glass, set it down, and was just in the act of drawing on his wool night-cap preparatory to plunging into his well-warmed bed, when he was suddenly startled by the loud ringing of the hall-door bell. ""What the foul fiend can that mean at this time of night?"" exclaimed Old Hurricane, dropping his night-cap, and turning sharply around toward Wool, who, warming-pan in hand, stood staring with astonishment. ""What does that mean, I ask you?"" ""Deed, I dunno, sir, if it's some benighted traveler in search of shelter out in the storm."" ""Humph! And in search of supper, too, of course, and everybody gone away or gone to bed but you and me."" At this moment the ringing followed by a loud knocking. ""Wool, don't let him and me listen to it, and then we shall tire ourselves with answering of it,"" suggested Wool. ""Was, sir! Do you think that I am going to turn a deaf ear to a stranger that comes to my house for shelter on such a night as this? Go and answer the bell directly."" ""Yes, sir."" ""But stop! Look here, mind I am not here to be disturbed; if it is a traveler, ask him in; set refreshments before him, show him to bed. I'm not going to leave my warm room to welcome anybody tonight, please the Lord."" ""Do you hear?"" ""Yes, sir,"" said the darkey, retreating. As Wool took a shaded taper and opened the door leading from his master's chamber, the wind was heard howling through the long passages ready to burst into the cozy bedroom. ""Shut the door, you scoundrel!"" roared Old Hurricane, folding the skirt of his warm dressing gown across his knees, and hovering closer to the fire. Wool quickly obeyed, and was heard retracing down the steps. ""Whew!"" said the old man, spreading his hands over the blaze with a look of comfortable appreciation. ""What would induce me to go abroad on such a night as this? Winds blowing great guns from the northwest, snow falling fast from the heavens and rising just as fast before the wind from the ground! Cold as Lapland, dark as Erebus! No telling the earth from the sky. Whew!"" and to comfort the cold thought, Old Hurricane poured out another glass of smoking punch and began to sip it. ""How I thank the Lord that I am not a doctor! If I were a doctor now, the sound of that bell at this hour of the night would frighten me: I should think some old woman had been taken with the pleurisy, and wanted me to get up and go out in the storm to turn out of my warm bed to ride ten miles through the snow to prescribe for her. A doctor never can feel sure, even in the worst of weathers, of a good night's rent. But, thank Heaven, I am free from all such annoyances, and I am sure of anything in this world it is of my comfortable sleep,"" said Old Hurricane, as he sipped his punch, smacked his lips, and toasted his feet. At this moment, Wool reappeared. ""Shut the door, you villain! Do you intend to stand there holding it open on me at night?"" vociferated the old man. Wool hastily closed the offending portals and hurried to his master's side. ""Well, sir, who was it rang the bell?"" ""Please, master, sir, it was the Reverend Mr. Parson Goodwin."" ""Goodwin? Been to make a sick call, I suppose, and got caught in the snowstorm. I declare, it is as bad to be a parson as it is to be a doctor! Thank the Lord I am not a parson, either! If I were, now, I might be called away from my cozy arm-chair and fireside to ride twelve miles to comfort some old man dying of quinsy. Wool, here help me into bed; pile on more comforters, tuck me up warm, put a bottle of hot water to my feet, and then go and attend to the parson,"" said the old man, getting up and moving towards his inviting couch. ""But! But! Stop, Wool, if you please!"" cried Wool, going after him. ""Why, what does the old fool mean?"" exclaimed Old Hurricane, angrily. ""But, the Reverend Mr. Parson Goodwin says how he must see you yourself, personable, alone."" ""See me, you villain! Didn't you tell him that I had retired?"" ""Yes, master, I told him how you were gone to bed and asleep more than an hour ago, and he ordered me to come wake you up, and say how it were a matter of life and death."" ""Life and death? What have I to do with life and death? I won't stir! If the parson wants to see me, he will have to come up here!"" exclaimed Old Hurricane, suiting the action to the word by jumping into bed and drawing all the comforters and blankets up around his head and shoulders. ""Must I fetch his reverence up, sir?"" ""Yes, I wouldn't get up and go down to see Washington! Shut the door, you rascal, or I'll throw the bootjack at your wooden head!"" Wool obeyed with alacrity, and in time to escape the threatened missile. After an absence of a few minutes, he was heard returning, attending upon the footsteps of another. And the next minute he entered, ushering in the Rev. Mr. Goodwin, the parish minister of St. Mary's. ""How do you do? How do you do? Glad to see you, sir! Glad to see you, though obliged to receive you in bed! Fact is, I caught a cold with this severe change of weather, and took a warm negus and got to bed to sweat it off. You'll excuse me! Wool, draw that easy chair up to my bedside for worthy Mr. Goodwin, and bring him a glass of warm negus. It will do him good after his cold ride."" ""I thank you, Major Warfield; I will take the seat, but not the negus, if you please, tonight."" ""Not the negus? Oh, come now, you are joking! Why, it will keep you from catching cold, and be a most comfortable night-cap, disposing you to sleep and sweat like a baby. Of course you spend the night with us?"" ""I thank you, no; I must take the road again in a few minutes."" ""Take the road again tonight? Why, man alive, it is midnight, and the snow driving like all Lapland!"" ""Sir, I am sorry to refuse your proffered hospitality, and leave your comfortable roof tonight, and sorrier still to have to take you with me,"" said the pastor, gravely. ""Take it with you? No, no, my good sir, no, no, that is too great a joke! Ha! Ha!"" ""Sir, I fear that you will find it a very serious one! Your servant told you that my errand was one of imminent urgency."" ""Yes, something like life and death."" ""Exactly! Down in the cabin near the Punch Bowl there is an old woman dying."" ""There! I knew it! I was just saying there might be an old woman dying. But, my dear sir, what's that to me? What can I do?"" ""Humanity, sir, would prompt you."" ""But, my dear sir, how can I help her? I am not a physician to prescribe."" ""She is far past a physician's help. Nor am I a priest to hear her confession."" ""Her confession God has already received."" ""Well, and I am not a lawyer to draw up her will."" ""No, sir; but you were recently appointed one of the Justices of the Peace for Alleghany."" ""Yes. Well, what of that? That does not comprise the duty of getting up out of my warm bed and going through a snowstorm to see an old woman expire."" ""I regret to inconvenience you, sir; but in this instance your duty demands your attendance at the bedside of the dying woman."" ""I tell you I can't go, and won't! Anything in reason I'll do. Anything I can send she shall have. Here! Wool, look in my breeches pocket, and take out my purse and hand it to me. And then go and wake up Mrs. Condiment, and ask her to fill a large basket roll of everything a poor old dying woman might want, and you shall carry it."" ""Spare your arm, sir! The poor woman is already past all earthly, selfish wants. She only asks your presence at her dying bed."" ""But I can't go! The idea of turning out of my warm bed and exposing myself to a snowstorm at this time of night!"" ""Excuse me for insisting, sir; but this is an important duty,"" said the parson, mildly but firmly. ""I'll throw up my commission tomorrow!"" growled the old man. ""Tomorrow you may do that; but meanwhile, to-night, being still in the commission of the peace, you are bound to get up and go with me to this woman's bedside."" ""And what the demon is wanted of me there?"" ""To receive her dying deposition."" ""To receive a dying deposition? Good Heaven! Was she murdered, then?"" exclaimed the old man, in alarm, as he started out of bed and began to draw on his nether garments. ""Be composed; she was not murdered,"" said the parson. ""Well, then, what is it? Dying deposition! It must concern a crime!"" exclaimed the old man, hastily drawing on his coat. ""It does concern a crime."" ""What crime, for the love of Heaven?"" ""I am not at liberty to tell you. She will do that."" ""Wool, go down and rouse up John, and tell him to put Parson Goodwin's mule in the stable for the night. And tell him to put the black draught-horses to the closed carriage and light both the front lanterns, for we shall have a dark, stormy road."" ""Shut the door, you infernal! I beg your pardon, parson, but that villain always leaves the door ajar after him."" The good pastor bowed gravely. And the major completed his toilet by the time the servant returned and reported the carriage ready. ""The Devil's Punch Bowl!"" was the order given by Old Hurricane, as he followed the minister into the carriage. ""And now, sir,"" he continued, addressing his companion, ""I think you had better repeat that part of the church litany that prays to be delivered from battle, murder, and sudden death; for if we should be so lucky as to escape Black Donald and his gang, we shall have at least an equal chance of being upset in the darkness of these dreadful mountains.""

"18831112","V Piano Co Incivility There are two ways in which duty may be performed, civilly or uncivilly. The latter is seldom excusable, especially in a public servant. The man whose duty it is to close the doors of the post office when ordered to announce ""10 o'clock"" on Sunday mornings would do well to remember this. The hour for closing being fixed and known, no one has a right to entrance after, however much inconvenience the refusal may entail on them, but it is totally unnecessary that the applicant, if behaving properly himself, should be roughly jostled and thrust back as was the case with a well-known French newspaper proprietor yesterday morning, still less that the action should be accompanied by foul language. Instances of this sort of thing have occurred in the same place a good deal too frequently, and the Postmaster would do well to see that they are not repeated.

On Saturday, Itevaux went to her house during her absence and took the child away, placing him under the charge of his sister's husband, Mr. Pricer, a lawyer of this city. The result of this was that Itevaux was arrested by his late brothers on a double charge of assault and of stealing a fowl. Detective Cinq-Mars, taking advantage of the domestic troubles, stepped in and took the child, who was brought before the board yesterday morning together with another party intended. His Honor decided that the boy should remain where he was. Itevaux was remanded on the charge of assault and was sent over to the Police Court to answer to the charge, which was, however, dismissed.

The detective, with some assistance, entered the house, finding Mrs. Goderre throwing something into the fire. Quick as thought he pulled open the door of the stove in which there was a hot fire and discovered the purse he was looking for in flames, and before he could get it out it was totally consumed. He found the lady's bank book in which there was an entry of $7 deposited that day and a Persian lamb jacket which she had just bought. A few hours later, feeling sure that the balance of the money was hidden somewhere around the house, Detective Gladu made another search but only succeeded in finding a receipt for which Mrs. Goderre had paid for rent in the morning. The trio will be brought before the Police Magistrate this morning.

The schooner Hen Klower, Captain Bentley, had a very rough experience in the bay on Friday last, during the southerly storm. She was bound from River Herbert to this port, with coal, and when off Tuaeo hove to, the sea at the time making a clean sweep over the deck. It was impossible for the men to remain on deck and they were compelled to take to the rigging, where for four hours they hung half mast high, the sea sweeping over the deck to the depth of ten or fifteen feet, carrying with it the boat, wood, water and everything moveable. At midnight the little vessel drove up Ouaeo harbour with the speed of a racehorse, the seas completely hiding her front view, when she grounded. She was afterwards got off and arrived here to-day. The schooner Prussian General, from this port on Friday morning, drove ashore at Canco and struck the bottom with such force that a hole was punched in her and some of her timbers broken. She is now full of water. The court of enquiry which has been investigating the loss of the barque Minnie Gordon at North Point, Prince Edward Island, on the 8th November, concluded its work to-day, when a decision was given declaring: From a consideration of all the circumstances connected with the case, I have come to the conclusion that the barque was wrecked upon the north coast of Prince Edward Island, through the gross carelessness of the master and mate of that ship, and that the certificate of the master shall be suspended for the space of one year from this time, and in the event whenever he returns to this country, he brought to trial for his misconduct on the above occasion. Melligorm, after hearing the judgment, applied for a mate's certificate. He was recommended to apply to the minister. He further stated that the light on North Point, Prince Edward Island, was deceptive, and has caused a large number of wrecks.

A vision on the water! What do you think of that!

Chateauguay was fought in the autumn In 1813, the battles of St. Denis and St. Charles took place, also in November, when there was doubtless much more mud than snow If no information can be gleaned on this point, the next interesting piece of information would be when the use of snow shoes was first introduced among the troops stationed at Montreal and Quebec While we are in the martial vein, let me jot down another paragraph I was lamenting to a military friend the other day that to save War rakes had not thought it well to keep at least one battalion of Imperial troops in the old Citadel of Quebec, in their territorial administration In the course of the conversation, my friend mentioned this remarkable coincidence, that the 1st Battalion of the 60th Royal Americans, who were the first to enter Quebec after the victory of the Plains in 1759, were the last to leave it on the final evacuation in 1860 Vanguard and rearguard on the same spot in an interval of 100 years According to the testimony of every guest the St. Andrew's dinner of this year was among the best ever held Mr Hogan's table was perfection The haggis was grand to eat, but grander to look at I know of one unsuspecting Englishman who tackled a spoonful of it and survived to boast of the same the next day But the canny Scotsmen wisely contented themselves with gazing thereat One new feature of the banquet, which was very much admired, was that the name of each subscriber was printed at the front of the menu Why not introduce another novelty into these National Society banquets?

"18831211","1TTI K, who might be called the pioneer lumberman of Western Camilla. His operations beginning on the Grand River in 1833, or just half a century ago, afterwards extended over nearly the whole of the Niagara peninsula. It sounds strange to-day to hear of Canadian pine lumber being a novelty in the Albany market, and yet Mr. Little could speak of encountering the same difficulties in introducing the clear white pine of the Grand River into the American markets that the Ottawa lumbermen did into the British markets, the Americans objecting to its softness, a quality now considered one of its most valuable characteristics. And as showing the changes taking place during the business life of an individual, he could speak of shipping single cargoes of lumber not exceeding 100 thousand feet to overstock the markets of Cleveland and Toledo, whereas these cities now find sale annually for about 200 and 300 millions respectively, while Chicago, not then in existence, finds markets for over 2,000 millions, or about as much as the entire sawn product of pine of the whole Dominion. Seeing during his business life such extraordinary changes in the consumption of lumber, it was hardly to be wondered that Mr. Little should in his later years become, as we all knew him, one of the most ardent advocates of forest protection. A BIT OF AUTOBIOGRAPHY. After serving an apprenticeship of five years learning the trade of joiner and carpenter in the Isle of Man (the F. llian Vanum of the Manx), my native place, so that I am a British subject by inheritance and a Canadian by choice (some contend that there is more merit in choosing to do well than to do so when you have no option in the matter, and the contrary when we decide to do wrong), I emigrated to America when still young. I landed in New York in 1842, almost forty-two years ago, after a passage of fifty-three days, with just half a dollar in my pocket. After paying a few necessary expenses, and after spending a day there in a vain attempt to find employment, I worked my way up the Hudson in the steamboat Swallow, which was afterwards lost in a snowstorm near Athens, thirty miles below Albany, in March 1843. I found employment at my trade, longing sadly for my old home and friends, but determined to propitiate that fickle dame, Fortune, with strong hopes, yet anxious to peer into the unknown and untried future. I, to some extent, succeeded in getting into her favour, so that after some years of hard work, patient industry, aiming to do right, following almost any sort of employment, always keeping in view that I had my trade to fall back upon, but often in those hard times I had to turn my attention to other work, and in the course of events got down to driving a horse to unload canal boats; afterwards got to the rank of captain of one of the Hudson River barges, with a crew, all told, of two, which included myself and a young Scottish until. Well do I remember the night, dark and at midnight, when in New York Bay we came very nearly being capsized, had our deck-load not rolled off (it was beer in barrels); perhaps some might not consider it a great loss, maybe less than it had been the speaker. If it had been the latter, you might have had from another something better than you have been treated to tonight. Boating having become unprofitable or unsuitable, I tried my hand at candle making and soap boiling, having acquired some experience in this line with my first employer who followed this business in Albany, and for whom I superintended the building of two houses. After trying for nearly a year along with another, to make this a success I abandoned it, as my partner imbibed too freely. That is the risk on which too many wreck their hopes. One day he allowed the soap pan to boil over; much of the contents ran into the drain, which was fully as bad as if the fat went into the fire. I then concluded it was best to dissolve, which I did by selling out. I fell back on my trade again. You can gather from this the advantage of having a trade: it is equal to a fortune and often better, as it cannot be dissipated as long as you have health and strength. It need not prevent boys from getting a good education, one that will fit them to mix in any society or to fill any position in business, and giving them great advantages in the event of becoming employers of labour. Mr. Ward then gave some particulars of his lumbering experience and concluded: If what I have said will aid or encourage any young man who may be listening to me, to take heart and never be weary of trying, I would say, there is nothing like trying, even though he be without friends, with only half a dollar of capital to commence with, remember that ""Honour nor fame from no condition rise, Act well your part, there all the honour lies."" At the conclusion, a hearty vote of thanks was passed to Mr. Ward for his interesting and valuable lecture. ""EXE YOUR Hop Bitters have been of great value to me. I was laid up with typhoid fever for over two months and could get no relief until I tried your Hop Bitters. To those suffering with debility or anyone in feeble health, I cordially recommend them."

THE SNOWSTORM The trains delayed by the heavy snow incidents of the storm. The heavy snowfall of the last few days had the effect of delaying the trains considerably yesterday. The train from the West was delayed eight hours, having encountered heavy snow drifts at various points east of Kingston. Train No. 2 East was detained six and a half hours, and No. 4 East due at Bonaventure at 12:03 was five hours late. The Delaware and Hudson and Vermont Central trains were also delayed. The Sorel train for Montreal became blocked at Boucherville and had to remain until a snow plough could be sent to its relief. It arrived in the afternoon. The trains were all late last evening. The Canada Atlantic train due at 8:30 last evening did not arrive until nearly 1 o'clock this morning, having been delayed on the way from Ottawa by the heavy snow. The Canadian Pacific trains were also delayed. It was rumored last evening that an accident had occurred on the line between St. Martin's Junction and Montreal, but on inquiry the only information that could be obtained was that the train had been blocked up by the snow at Thereson. The train had not arrived in the city up to a late hour. The Grand Trunk train which left Toronto on Wednesday night did not arrive until 8 o'clock last night, being twelve hours late. The train was delayed some nine hours between Port Hope and Bowmanville by the heavy snow, and about three hours' time was lost during the remainder of the journey to Montreal.

Several had to return to the city this morning, failing to drive to Cataraqui. The Kingston & Pembroke Railway sent out a snow plough last night and this morning, therefore the trains were delayed very little. The train from the West this morning was eight hours late. It got stuck about three hundred yards from the depot, but, with the assistance of two engines and a snow plough, it passed the city about 11:30. The train from the East got stuck a little below the depot also, and was delayed five hours. Clinton, Ont., January 3 A severe snowstorm raged all day.

A resolution was also passed asking the Mayor to communicate with the Dominion Government, respectfully requesting that one or more persons be appointed to visit the scene of the accident, make full enquiry as to the cause of the same and report thereon, so that means may be taken whereby a repetition of such a calamity may in future be prevented. Another resolution was passed that the committee appointed be also an advisory board if desired by the chairman to lay their cases before the Grand Trunk authorities and assist in making settlement to their best advantage. Hopes are now entertained that all the wounded in hospital will recover. This morning it was definitely arranged to have a public funeral tomorrow afternoon at two o'clock.

"18840116","CLEAKING THE SIDEWALKS A large number of householders were fined in the Recorder's Court yesterday for not keeping their sidewalks in proper order; ten more will be brought up today, and a number of new actions were issued which cannot be heard for a few days owing to the press of business in the Court. The Chief of Police thinks that if the fine were raised to $10 or even $20, the nuisance would soon be abated. In regard to the city taking the work in hand as was proposed at the last meeting of the Council, Chief Paradis feels sure that the plan would never work, as after a heavy snowstorm they would have to employ a very large number of men who could not possibly get over the city in less than four or five days. Then one party here and another there would commence shoveling the snow off their roofs, making the streets as bad as ever. Thus the work would never end, whereas if each householder cleared the sidewalk in front of his own door it would only take a few minutes, and the whole city would be gone over at once. The trouble, he says, is not with poor people who shovel their own snow, but with merchants and business men who leave it to be done or neglected by their servants. When the poor people are so ready to do the work for themselves, he thinks it would be unjust to make them pay for someone else to do it."
"18840117","The steamer Montreal sailed for Portland. The barque Tallin, from Tahiti for Halifax, with a cargo of sugar for the Moncton refinery, was wrecked on Sunday night on Elmwood Island, one of the Tuskets, near Yarmouth. Being deceived by the strong current and thick snowstorm, the captain was considerably out of his course, and when the vessel struck those on board could not make out where they were, and as the wind was blowing and the sea was beginning to break over the vessel, the crew took to the boats, remaining in them until Monday, and arrived at the lighthouse. Shortly after, a tug was sent from Yarmouth, when a small portion of the cargo and materials was saved. The vessel is a total loss. She was owned in Greenock, and is partially insured there. The cargo is insured in Boston. Vital questions!

Many persons were injured. The glass roof of the Westminster Aquarium was demolished, causing a panic among the audience, in which several persons were hurt. A printing office in the Haymarket was unroofed and a boy killed. Many vessels were wrecked off the coast, and a large number of lives lost. Reports from all parts of the kingdom agree that the gale was one of almost unparalleled severity. At Hastings the seas dashed over the streets, making walking dangerous. At Monmouth, the Wye and Monnow Rivers overflowed and the highways were flooded, and Southampton and Eastbourne suffered severely. At Torquay there were many casualties. Trees were uprooted and many boats swamped. Shops on the Isle of Wight closed early on Saturday owing to the hurricane. At Newry many houses were unroofed. At Leeds the roof of a dwelling collapsed, killing the daughter of a workman. The mail train between Durham and Darlington was twice stopped by the gale. The large Nokomis, Capt. Murphy, which sailed for Londonderry on January 10th for Baltimore, and which returned to Lough Foyle for shelter, parted her cables and was driven out to sea. It is feared the vessel and all hands have been lost. The iron chapel at Newcastle was demolished, and the roof falling killed a woman and two children. A heavy snowstorm raged in many places. There have been numerous marine casualties around the coast, the trisia reports having had a rough passage, with heavy gales and tremendous sea.

"18840207","THE CARNIVAL Splendid Success of Yesterday's Events - STORMING THE ICE PALACE A Scene of Magnificent Brilliancy THE VICE-REGAL RECEPTION - Continuation of the Curling Bonspiel THE GREAT SLEIGH PARADE The now famous procession, hockey match, promenade and skating concert Vice-regal movement Carnival notes Today's programme The third day of the Carnival, despite somewhat unfavourable circumstances as regards the weather, which was not so bright as could be desired, proved in every respect fully equal in attraction and the success with which the events of the programme were carried out to the two previous days. The impression being that it would be the crowning day of the week, large numbers of visitors had timed their arrival for it, and consequently, large as had been the crowds on the streets before, they were far surpassed yesterday. And the events of the day proved fully worthy of the interest they excited. Nothing finer of its kind, or more unique in feature, than the grand sleigh parade could be imagined, and from end to end of the route along which the procession passed, the streets were lined with spectators so thickly that driving became a matter of great difficulty. And it is a matter for congratulation that no serious accident occurred to mar the pleasure of the occasion. Another great attraction and one of character novel alike to citizens and strangers, was the tobogganing masquerade of the Lansdowne Club, which brought together on Fletcher's Hill thousands of eager sightseers, including His Excellencies the Governor-General and the viceregal suite, who also took part in the slide. It was a graceful and very thoughtful compliment of Lord Lansdowne to appear in the picturesque costume of the club, and the club deserves congratulation on its having been paid them by their noble patron. It may not be out of place to mention a word of caution to those who have the management of the slides. Of course, with so large an assemblage it was a hard matter to preserve perfect order, but there certainly should be some measure taken to prevent people crossing the track with their toboggans while gliding is going on. Several slight accidents occurred from this being done, and in one case the daughter of a well-known medical gentleman was upset, receiving several severe bruises and a deep cut in the head which had to be attended to by a doctor and stitched. The hockey matches, notwithstanding the snowstorm and the raw cold, were witnessed by large numbers, who seemed to enjoy the spectacle. But the ice palace still continues to be the great object of interest, and the special features in connection with it at night sufficed to gather together probably the largest open-air assemblage ever seen in this city. Novel and beautiful beyond description, the attack and defence, with the attendant illumination by electric light, the pyrotechnic display, and the eager excitement with which it was witnessed, furnished a scene simply indescribable. Another notable event of the day was the reception by the Governor-General and Lady Lansdowne, which enabled so many of our citizens, and it is pleasing to add, so many American visitors, to meet personally the viceregal pair who have already won so high a place in the affections of our people. Today the programme will be continued and the events will be found no less attractive than those which have already taken place, the chief being the skating carnival which takes place at the Victoria Rink in the evening. Alex Caldwell, the secretary, and others THE HIGHLIGHT PLEASE Montreal has reason to be proud of the number and variety of its winter vehicles, and the sleigh parade of yesterday afternoon served better than anything else could have done to show them off to the best advantage. Never before, we venture to say, has such a sight been witnessed in Canada or on the continent of America as was presented yesterday afternoon on Dominion Square and along the whole route of procession. Long before two o'clock, vehicles of every description and of all sizes commenced to arrive at the meeting place, corner of St. Catherine and Peel Street, and soon the whole of the street from St. Catherine to Dorchester Street was completely blocked with sleighs. The rush was so great in fact that the three marshals who had been appointed to superintend the affair seemed to be taken by surprise, and soon the street presented a most unmanageable scene of disorder, all kinds of vehicles being mingled together without the least approach to order. At the corner of Catherine and Peel Street, the scene was quite animated, and the excitement was palpable as the procession began to move. Braver Hall Hill, St. James, Notre Dame, which requested a b, T. Shedje Lymmr Jhenet, Sherbrooke, and other express vehicles, which were expected to row or precede the whole in, were gaily decorated with flowers. The only thrill with this new event was the unfortunate attempt and the near collision that will no doubt cause them to remember the snowshoers and their turnout. The last stroke had been put upon the ""tolly ho,"" the snowshoers had mounted their seats, the colored coachmen had taken their places, and the boys were indulging in all kinds of noises more exciting than musical, when a splendid pair of horses, attached to a handsome sleigh, frightened by the noise quickened their pace and took to the narrow space between the turnout and the sidewalk. But unluckily there was an incline at this point in the road, and in quicker time than it takes to write it, the occupants of the sleigh were reclining in the snow. With the exception of a slight shock to the sensibilities of the ladies, who were evidently not used to such happenings, fortunately no one was hurt. Time wore on apace, however; 2 o'clock, the time appointed for the drive, had gone by, and still there was no appearance of a start; the members of the Driving Committee were stationed in front of the Windsor endeavoring, as best they could, to produce some kind of order out of the chaos; marshals were galloping to and fro, striving to get the drivers to obey them. This was more than an easy task, however. At last the snowshoers' turnout commenced to move amid sundry blowings of horns from its occupants and the wondering remarks of the onlookers. The driver seemed to be quite an expert jehu, but the progress amid the thick mass of sleighs was slow, and it took some time to reach Dorchester Street. Here a most amusing incident occurred. Suddenly the expression was heard ""It's over""; the crowd rushed to the place indicated, and behold! the splendid equipage was lying on its side and the snowshoers were floundering in the road, while the Union Jack for once was trailing, not in the dust, but in the snow, but the flag that has braved a thousand years was soon raised aloft again by the jolly snowshoers. Once more they took their places, the incident only serving to raise their spirits, if anything, to a higher pitch of excitement. Gradually the different sleighs commenced to form behind the snowshoers, and finally the procession started on its way. To give a description of all the novelties in winter vehicles that composed the procession, to picture the drive with all its scenes and incidents, and to give an idea of the vast number of people that entered the drive at different points of the city, would require the imagination of a poet and would test the patience of the reader. The drive, in fact, was a thing to be seen and not to be written about, and, once seen, it would always be remembered. Taken altogether, it was truly a grand sight, and must have made our American visitors truly envious of a city that could make such a splendid display. Though a mild snowstorm continued during the afternoon, the weather was pleasant and fine and the roads were in good condition. The crowd of spectators was, without doubt, greatest at Dominion Square. Every available spot where a good sight could be obtained was taken advantage of, and the square was literally black with people. Through this dense crowd of spectators, progress was at first slow. The marshal of the procession, however, led the way, followed by a handsome four-in-hand attached to a covered sleigh, containing Aid. Hixsi and lady; then came the snowshoers' turnout, which attracted general applause. After several single sleighs, another four-in-hand express, containing more snowshoers, passed by. Then followed a countless number of all kinds of vehicles, from the gorgeous six-in-hand to the miniature pony sleigh. Each vehicle came in for its share of attention. One of the most splendid turnouts in the procession was that of Mr. Andrew Allan. The vehicle was the magnificent box sleigh which obtained first prize at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, and with a handsome set of choice black bear robes, trimmed with red green, and drawn by three pairs of thoroughbred chestnuts, ridden by Messrs."
"18840209","THE CURLING BONSPIEL Although by far the best contested and most interesting matches of the bonspiel were played yesterday, the attendance of spectators was very poor, a fact which was probably due to the snowstorm which lasted all day. The ice was in splendid condition, and the play was exceedingly good. Of course, the greatest interest centred in the international match for the Gordon medal, and quite a crowd gathered around the rink expecting to see the visitors beaten, but in this they were disappointed. The Americans appeared cool and confident, and soon secured a lead of a few points, which they gradually increased until they finished with eight points to the good. The excitement had by this time risen to fever heat, and when the visitors were declared the victors they were greeted with rounds of hearty cheering. The match lasted from half-past nine till two o'clock. Several changes have been made in the personnel of both teams, as will be seen by the following: UNITED STATES"

Again was the weather capricious, and instead of the bright and sunny skies on the previous day, Saturday was marked by a heavy snowstorm which lasted until late in the afternoon. But this fact was not allowed to interfere with the closing events of the Carnival, which were all carried out in a most successful manner. The hockey matches and curling conspicuously were concluded, as were also the trotting races at the driving park. The Tandem Club's drive in the afternoon was a splendid display of fine horseflesh and splendid equipages and justly excited the admiration of visitors, many of whom, including His Excellency the Governor-General and Lady Lansdowne, were guests of the club. At night a grand illumination on all the tobogganing hills attracted thousands, and the second carnival at the Victoria Skating Rink was attended by a very large number. The snowshoe race, despite the unfavorable weather and the heaviness of the track, was very interesting, and the spectators filled the stands. The viceregal party took their departure in the afternoon, an enthusiastic crowd bidding them bon voyage. The final display of fireworks at the ice palace took place in the evening, and the beautiful edifice was once more the center of an admiring throng. The week's gaiety is over, leaving behind it yet the fairy-like edifice which has been its crowning glory, a host of good feelings, and for the hotels and stores a good surplus of profit. Its success continued to the close, and to the last the enthusiasm was unabated. The end too was a happy one; amid a blaze of electric light, the ice palace a few minutes before the hour of twelve on Saturday night was the scene of a shower of rockets, with the strains of the national anthem and Auld Lang Syne resounding through hall and corridor of the Windsor as the snowshoers dispersed, midnight struck, and the Carnival of 1884 was a thing of the past. THE TROTTING, Saturday's racing at the Driving Park on account of the heavy snowstorm was rather a disappointment to many who looked forward to a gala day's sport. The crowd was less numerous than on Thursday, and only one race took place, the gentlemen's race for the Carnival Cup being postponed for a fortnight. The judges were Mr. H.

New York, February 14 Despatches from London to the Herald say Mr. Mackay, president of the new Commercial Cable Company, has concluded all the arrangements necessary to make the success of the Mackay-Bennett cable an absolute certainty. The company, wishing to be independent of any land lines, which, as the experience of other companies has shown, are subject to constant interruptions caused by gales and snowstorms, have ordered their cables to be laid double, not only across the Atlantic, but also throughout their entire distance to their landing points in New York and Massachusetts. One cable, landing at Cape Ann, will be able to carry messages direct to Boston and the eastern States. The other will run up to Fire Island, and thence through the Great South Bay to Coney Island and right into New York by means of an underground cable. This route has been carefully chosen with the view of avoiding the danger of possible damage from ships' anchors. Both cables will run down the coast from Nova Scotia in a depth of water not less than 100 fathoms. From the same consideration Fire Island was selected as the point of destination in preference to Sandy Hook. Mr. Mackay has looked after every detail and has procured every means which a liberal expenditure can command and the skill of the most experienced electricians can suggest for providing against all eventualities. A steel repairing steamer of 1,500 tons and 1,400 horsepower, capable of carrying 750 tons of cubic, besides its coal, and steaming eleven knots, has been ordered from Messrs. Elder, who will build it under the supervision of St. Clare Byrne, for many years manager of Laird's shipbuilding firm. A satisfactory arrangement has also been concluded with Sir Julian Goldsmid, of the Submarine Telegraph Company, which possesses the monopoly of the right of laying cables across the channel. The Submarine Company, besides granting the right to the Commercial Company to lay their cable, also undertakes in case of interruption or accident, to convey all their messages directly through their own lines across the channel until the completion of the necessary repairs. The new cable, instead of stopping at Brest, will run directly into Havre, by which more prompt and reliable service will be obtained, as it was found in the case of the other companies that the land lines between Brest and Paris were often interrupted by gales, thus causing a delay of several hours. Dover Bay, on the Nova Scotia coast, has been selected as the landing place of the new cable. It is simply a little sheltered cove in the rocky coast about five miles to the south of Cape Canso, the northeast corner of Nova Scotia. The shores of this bay are inhabited by six families of fishermen, and the only industry of the place is fishing. No attempt is made to cultivate the sterile ground in the vicinity and no possibility of communication with the rest of the world excepting by cable or boat suggests the idea of commerce. Its availability as a cable landing lies in the fact that it is little out of the track of the large masses of floating ice that drift southward under the northerly and easterly winds that prevail here much of the time. These ice floes are heavy enough to crush a cable flat against rock, and the difficulty is to find a course from sea to land that shall be free from this danger. Already Dover Bay has been utilized by the American Telegraph and Cable Company, whose cables are landed on the west side, nearly opposite the landing place selected for the new cable. The station of this company is situated in Canso, the cable being brought from Dover Bay thither in a trench six or seven miles in length."

"18840303","THE EHOWSTOBX, The delay to the train service stranded bound passengers. The snowstorm which began on Thursday evening and which did not abate until Saturday was one of the severest that has been witnessed in this part of the country for many a year. The train on the Canadian Pacific Railway which left Montreal at seven o'clock on Friday morning managed to reach Ottawa at half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, being three hours behind time, but strange to say the fast express which left the city at 8:45 the same morning did not get any further than St Martin's Junction and the passengers were obliged to return to Montreal on Saturday night. The departure of the fast express from Ottawa on Friday afternoon was delayed for an hour, and at 1:20 a start was made, two engines being attached to the train, and a snow plough having been sent on ahead to clear the track. Before the latter reached Buckingham, however, some twenty miles from Ottawa, it had been so badly damaged that it was useless to send it any further. With the train everything went well until L'Ange Gardien was reached, being then a quarter of an hour behind the regular time limit. Here several of the passengers, fearing that the train would not be able to reach Montreal that night, as the train which left Montreal in the morning had not yet been heard of, alighted and stopped overnight. The train then proceeded on its way but got stuck in a snowdrift within a mile of St Augustine. The shovellers were at once set to work, and after a delay of three hours and a half, the train got through and proceeded until St. Andrew was reached. Here another delay occurred, which was accentuated by the fact that the snow-plough which had been left at Buckingham was observed struggling in the snow-drift through which the train had just safely passed, and it was thought that it would be better to let the plough go ahead of the train. After waiting for over two hours, however, it was evident that the plough was not equal to the task, and the train actually got under way but had only seen a couple of miles when a most annoying snowdrift was encountered, it being then about two o'clock Saturday morning. The drift at this point, which was heavily packed, was five or six feet deep and extended for over a mile, so there was no help for it but to camp there overnight. In the morning, the conductor, Mr. Dwyer, drove to St. Therese, a distance of about five miles, where he secured an additional gang of men, who at once went to work and shortly before twelve o'clock they had sufficiently cleared the track to permit the train to proceed. On reaching St. Therese, however, still another drift was met with, which took the shovellers about four hours to get rid of, when the train again proceeded on its way and reached St. Martin Junction about six o'clock, after having experienced several short delays on account of minor drifts. At St. Martin the passengers on the train which left Montreal at 8:45 the previous morning were taken on board and the train again got under way. Before coming to the bridge across the Back River at Sault aux Recollets, another drift was encountered, occasioning a delay of about an hour, and the train came in contact with another very heavy snow drift within about two miles of the Mile End Depot, which occasioned a delay of about four hours. At this point several of the passengers discussed the advisability of attempting to walk to the city, but all finally decided to remain on board. About eleven o'clock the shovellers had cleared the track and the train again proceeded, reaching the Dalhousie Square Depot about 11:30 on Saturday night, having taken thirty hours to make the journey. Much credit is due to the conductor, the engineers, and the other officials of the train for the manner in which they acquitted themselves under the circumstances, the opinion of all being that it was one of the worst storms they ever had experienced. Many of the shovellers were completely exhausted; in fact, some of them were so fatigued that they were unable to work when the last snow-drift was reached. The snow in several places blew into the railway cut almost as fast as it was shovelled out. ON THE CANADA ATLANTIC, matters were not much better. The trains which left the city on Friday did not reach Ottawa until early Saturday morning. The early train from Ottawa on Saturday was cancelled or rather its departure was delayed until eleven o'clock, when the conductor expressed a belief that he would make the usual time to Montreal. Everything went well as far as Glen Robertson, the track being clear and the regular time limit being observed. At that point it was ascertained that the train which left Montreal in the morning was stuck a short distance west of St. Polycarpe. The train going east got orders to meet it, and, if possible, help it through. About halfway between Glen Robertson and St. Polycarpe a serious snow drift was encountered, the snow being heavily packed. The shovellers went to work, and after a delay of about an hour and a half the train got through and proceeded until it reached within about a mile of St. Polycarpe. At that point the locomotive of the train which had left Montreal in the morning was found frozen stiff in the drift, which it had attempted to break through, and to do which it had left the passenger cars at the station at St. Polycarpe. The drift at this point was six or even seven feet deep and packed very heavily. The shovellers had been at work and had so far cleared the track that the locomotive of the eastern bound train was able to get up to the other, but that was found to be so firmly frozen that it took fully two hours to move it, several ropes being snapped in the operation, and at one time the prospect being that nothing could be done until greater locomotive power was obtained from Montreal. By dint of perseverance, however, the track was at last cleared, and each train was enabled to proceed on its way, that for Montreal reaching the city about 8 o'clock, having taken nine hours to make the journey. All the testimony of the railway hands is to the effect that no such storm has been experienced for years. Another train was despatched from Ottawa at 9 o'clock yesterday morning, arriving here at two in the afternoon, so that the road is now clear, and the regular trains will be run today."
"18840305","J. McDevitt recently caused the arrest of Rev. Father O'Boylan of the Catholic Church here for permitting the use of a wheel of fortune at a fair. O'Boylan denounced McDevitt from the pulpit as a villain and a murderer. On Sunday night friends of the priest compelled McDevitt to march out of town in a blinding snowstorm at the point of a pistol. When he had reached a secluded spot they made him remove all his clothing, which was cut into shreds and cast to the winds. The victim was then ordered to kneel in the snow and swear he would never set foot in Corning again. He complied and has not been seen since. It is feared he has perished. His friends vow vengeance. Later, the sheriff has arrested the persons who assaulted McDevitt. McDevitt reached New Lexington today. He was heavily armed. A warrant is out for Rev. Mr. O'Boylan.

A WIDESPREAD STORM Delay to railroad travel The Ottawa trains- Telegraph wires damaged The blockade at various points. The storm of the past two days has greatly impeded railway travel, and all trains have been delayed and in several cases entirely cancelled. Of the liners out of the city those to Ottawa have suffered most. The train leaving on Saturday morning at 7 o'clock on the Canadian Pacific was fortunate in getting out ahead of the storm and passed through. That at 8:45 succeeded in getting through as far as Mile End only, and after waiting all day her passengers returned to the city in the evening. The 4:30 train did not leave. It was intended to dispatch a train yesterday morning but the hour was changed until 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and there being no change for the better it was finally cancelled. Information was conveyed to the hotels last night that both the 7 o'clock and 8:45 train this morning are cancelled, but it is expected that the line will be clear by noon. Of the incoming trains on the same line none arrived; that which left Ottawa on Saturday morning got as far as St. Scholastique, where it remained, and up to two o'clock this morning was still blockaded there. Of the Canada Atlantic trains only one left Ottawa on Saturday, and that was blockaded at St. Polycarpe, not having reached the city up to two o'clock this morning, but was then expected at any moment. None of the outgoing trains on the same road got out, the passengers returning to Montreal. The Western on Saturday night left as usual and also that of last night. Trains from the south yesterday evening were fairly on time. L'Isle, March 9 The storm which set in yesterday still continues. The railways are nearly all snowed up.

"18840902","S and about 150 miles northeast of Halifax, and is well known to mariners as a dangerous spot. The continued action of the sea during heavy weather is gradually washing away the land at the west end, while new land appears to be steadily forming on the bars at the eastern end, where vegetation is now seen. The length of the island is about 22 miles, and it varies in breadth from a quarter of a mile to a mile. Life-saving stations are established at the east end and at the main stations. In addition to the life boat, there are surf boats kept in readiness for any emergency, and the men are practiced once a week. At the main station is also kept a complete rocket apparatus, and a life car at the east end station. There are five stations in all on the island and a staff of 17 men. Mr. Smith, in this connection, denied the exaggerated reports in American papers to the effect that the passengers of the K.S. Amsterdam, wrecked on Cable Island in July last, had been ill-treated by the natives, the fact being that no persons are allowed to reside on the island excepting the staff. An abundant supply of provisions is kept by the government in case of an emergency, besides forty or fifty head of cattle. During fogs and snowstorms, men patrol the beach on horseback to ascertain wrecks. The British Government contributes £100 annually towards the maintenance of the humane establishment. What is still wanted to make the life-saving station more efficient is connection by telegraph cable with the mainland, and telephone connection between each end of the island. Mr. Smith then referred at length to the organization of the department of marine and fisheries, the character of the staff and the scope of their duties. Since the department was organized in 1867, three hundred and fifty-one new lighthouses have been built, and the amount expended for this purpose, including the cost of 23 fog whistles and 9 steam fog horns, has been $1,095,620, which gives an average of $1,000 for each. A number of these lights were for inland waters, built of wood of an inexpensive description, costing under $1,000. During the current year 20 new lights will be added to the list. All the lighthouses erected since confederation have been built of wood, as being much cheaper and more expedient of construction. The extent of sea coast in the Dominion to be lighted up and provided with tug whistles, bell-buoys, etc., is 3,200 miles; and of inland coast 2,600 miles. To effect this object there are 308 sea-coast light stations, 224 inland light stations, and 17 light ships. In Quebec there are 147 light stations, in Ontario 139, New Brunswick 82, Nova Scotia 110, Prince Edward Island 39, British Columbia 7. The number of light stations in Canada with fixed lights is 468, and with revolving lights 82, and the number of persons employed is 650. Since confederation the number of light stations has increased from 138 to 570, and of fog whistles from 2 to 38. Mr. Smith dwelt at length on the character of the lighthouses constructed, the apparatus employed, etc., and closed his exhaustive paper amid loud applause.

In the Prime Meridian Conference yesterday the French delegates warmly opposed a proposition made by one of the United States representatives to adopt Greenwich time as the standard. No action was taken. A madman's freak. Eaii, Pa, October 3. A terrible tragedy was prevented today through the interference of the authorities. Leo Schreck and wife, and John Flick had $118 deposited in the Erie County Savings Bank, and when the bank suspended the loss of the money drove them insane. Thinking afterwards that they were committing a great sin they inflicted self-flagellation. Today two officers observed the man and wife digging a grave back of the yard. The house was entered, where it was found that they intended to enact the death of Christ, which was to be followed by the killing of children to represent Herod's slaughter of the innocents. They are now in custody. Terrible railway fatality, St. Paul, October 3. Particulars of a railway accident near Bayfield say a crew of twenty, two men were all riding on an engine and tender when the engine plunged into a washout. The boiler was staved in and every man but one killed or injured. Two were killed outright and nine others badly scalded, who were removed to Ashland, where four died before morning, including the conductor, engineer, and fireman. It is believed three more will die from scalding. Coal and coke workers' strike. Connellsville, Pa, October 3. Miners and coke drawers of the Worrell and Cambria Coke Works in the Connellsville region struck today against a proposed 10 percent reduction by the Cambria Co. Works and ovens which employed 4,000 men are now idle. The rate of wages paid, which is uniform throughout the region, is 35 cents for digging coal and 60 cents for oven-drawing coke. A remarkable temperature. St. Paul, October 3. Last night was the hottest night on record. The thermometer never fell below 72 all night, rising as high as 80 at midnight. A strange sensation was felt by the citizens. Many feared an impending disaster of some kind. The air was stirring. At other points in the Northwest the thermometer was low. At Helena a snowstorm is reported. Anti-Jewish feeling; Philadelphia, Pa, October 3. Hars, Field & Co, shoe dealers, refuse to sell any goods to Hebrews.

A Queenstown despatch to the friends of Miss Carpenter, who has been missing several days, says a lady registered on the Bothnia as Mrs. Blake was missed after the second day. Her friends fear that this may prove a solution to her disappearance. A fatal mistake. Des Moines, October 3. Wm. Harrison was blown to pieces and ten other miners injured, some fatally, by the explosion of a keg of powder in a saloon at the Excelsior Mine yesterday. Harrison supposed the keg contained fruit or jelly, and while examining it dropped a spark from his pipe. A bad showing; Washington, October 3. The liabilities of the collapsed banking house of Middleton & Co. are $648,000 and the nominal assets $200,000.

All along the harbour the cellars of the warehouses in lower town are flooded also buildings as far back as the hills. In some instances along the front streets the water reaches over the first floors. The extent of the damage cannot be fully ascertained tonight. The principal streets flooded are Dalhousie, St. Peter, Bault au Malot, St. Paul, and Commissioners streets, extending as far as St. Rochs and the entire length of Champlain street. The tide has now receded, and the water is making its disappearance. It came so suddenly that none of the merchants were prepared. They were generally notified of an unusually high tide being expected, but this morning's tide was only of the usual height and gave no idea of the approaching flood. Hence there were no precautions taken. The water rose to a depth of three feet on Dalhousie street, and about one foot on St. Peter street. A number of the wharves and pontoons have been badly broken up and loosened. The names of the principal streets affected are: DAMAGE AT RIMOUSKI, Rimouski, November 5 The spring tides, which are usually very high at this season of the year, visited this place last night and today, and, helped by a raging snowstorm and high northeast wind, were swollen tremendously. The sea which is now running is the heaviest that has visited this vicinity for years. The whole town of Rimouski is inundated and almost forms a part of the sea itself. A large number of homes, barns, and stables, as also various wharves, about 15 to 18 in number, have been carried away with their contents. So far as heard, no lives have been lost. Part of the I.C. track is inundated and trains are delayed. The people are leaving their houses in boats. Cattle have been turned loose and have taken to the interior of the country. Several stores where goods were placed have become almost worthless. Further fears are entertained for the next high tide. The loss so far is estimated at between $25,000 and $50,000. AT FATHER POINT, Father Point, November 5 A fearful snow and wind storm from the east has been raging since midnight yesterday all along the coast. The wind averages 70 miles per hour. The sea is tremendous and has crossed the highways and inundated the fields of all the parishes along the coast. Here the lighthouse and telegraph office is completely surrounded by the raging waves. The roads are all undermined. The watch-house here and several buildings here and at Bic are carried away, besides fences, etc. Great numbers of people have vacated their buildings at Rimouski, and much uneasiness is felt for tonight's tide if the storm does not go down. The Intercolonial track and roadway is washed away between Rimouski and Bic. No lives are lost, so far as is known yet. 8:50 p.m. The signal and telegraph men have now abandoned the station, having to take to their boats. The greatest storm that has visited this vicinity for forty years is now playing havoc with everything. RIVIERE DU LOUP, Riviere du Loup, November 5 There has been a heavy snowstorm raging here since last night, and still continues with a heavy wind from the northeast. The sea is sweeping over the wharf and has carried off a lot of lumber piled on it, and has also swept away the store where the telegraph office was, and the kitchen of the house belonging to L.

"18841107","B, November 6 Information from reliable sources says that out of eight ships off Kamouroska yesterday two are missing, supposed to have lost their anchors or run for Quebec. Two schooners at the Brandy Pots broke their chains and went adrift. The old wreck of the Margaret M, which was lying about twenty yards from the house of Mr. Puize at this wharf, was washed alongside of the house, and quite likely this, with the help of some fifty men, is what saved the building. The steamer Union had a very narrow escape from being wrecked while lying at the wharf at Eboulements. The passengers were all landed at the commencement of the gale, but the cargo was more or less damaged by the rolling of the boat and the seas shipped. One schooner is aground at the wharf. WHARVES SWEPT AWAY; Trois Pistoles, Q, November 6 We suffered much damage here by the rise of water. Three yachts were partly destroyed and a schooner damaged. The wharf is nearly all destroyed; all that part made of stone and sand has been swept away, and the bridge and a lot of wood washed off. The loss is estimated at between $20,000 and $30,000. Green Island, Que, November 6 A heavy wind and snowstorm visited this place yesterday. Up till this morning about two feet had fallen. No casualties are reported. AT LITTLE METIS; Little Metis, November 6 A most severe snow and windstorm visited this coast yesterday, clearing everything in its way. All the houses along the shore have been carried off, also boats, fences, bridges, etc. The shore today is strewn with debris and household effects. The suffering will be intense from cold and hunger to those left destitute. L'Islet flooded; L'Islet, November 6 The damage by yesterday's storm is considerable, amounting to nearly $7,000. All the principal streets and shops in all quarters of the village were flooded, some merchants losing heavily. All the wharves have been more or less damaged. The pavements in the streets have floated off. The whole village is in a very dilapidated condition. AT MATANE AND TADOUSAC; Matane, November 6 The storm of yesterday was the most severe that has been felt for many years past. The tide rose upwards of two feet over the ordinary November spring tides. Two parts of the Prince Bros. & Co. wharf were carried away and quite a number of deals floated out. Several persons here were obliged to abandon their houses. The damage will be about $3,000. Tadousac, Que, November 6 The wharf at this place and other property have been considerably damaged by yesterday's cyclone. It is stated that there has not been so severe a storm for the past fifty years. The damage cannot be estimated at present. St. Thomas (Montmagny), November 6 The most severe snow and windstorm that has ever visited this town commenced yesterday afternoon and continued during the whole night. Considerable damage was done to the breakwater by the high tides. Ice is forming here very quickly. Car Rocs, Que, November 6 The steamer Champion, with five schooners in tow, bound for Quebec put in here for shelter last night. One of her tows was cast adrift. The market steamers Etoile and St. Louis, with about 200 passengers on board, had also to seek shelter here, a violent hurricane blowing. The tide rose about four feet above the normal spring tide mark, accompanied by a mild cyclone and snowstorm which lashed the waters into a fury. Part of the village was inundated; damage light. Two feet of snow had fallen this morning. Sleighing is excellent and the weather cold. FASSTIVA, LC, November 6 Yesterday afternoon, at a point about three and a half miles east of Bic station, on the Intercolonial railway, the road of the Intercolonial for a distance of about a hundred feet was washed away by the extraordinary high tide. The damage was luckily discovered before the eastbound express reached Bic, and it was stopped at the station. A special train was then brought from Campbellton, with the intention of having the passengers and mails from the express train carted across the dangerous section, it being evident that the track could not be made passable for many hours. Unfortunately, about a mile east of the first was another and far worse washout, the lower part of the road for about three hundred feet having been swept away, but there was nothing on the surface to denote that such was the case. The engines and two cars jolted over the place safely, but the remaining cars of the train careened into the river. A brakeman named Perrin and a telegraph repairer named Lefrere were injured, neither seriously. A gang of men immediately set about building a temporary trestle, while another gang bored the track inward at the western washout. About two this afternoon both places were fit to traverse, and the express train, after its long delay, pursued its way eastward in safety."

It consisted of 21,000 bushels of wheat and 10 cars of flour, flax and sundries. An exchange says: Very few sailors or other persons engaged in marine business have the remotest idea of the number of vessels in service on the lakes. They know in a general way that there are a good many, but beyond that they could not come within 1,000 of the right figures if they were asked the question. The talent vessel registers, and they are very complete, show that there are 1,070 American sailing vessels (including barges) and 1,188 Canadian sailing vessels. There are, besides, 840 American steam vessels of all classes, and 328 Canadian steam vessels, making a total of 2,188 steam and sail vessels. Those figures do not include the St. Lawrence river barges. Careful estimates place the average tonnage of these vessels at 350 tons, which would make the total tonnage of the lakes, exclusive of the river barges, 87,760 tons. This is not a high estimate. Milwaukee, November 25. The gale has greatly damaged sailing craft on the lakes. The crews suffered terribly from cold and exposure. Port Colborne, November 26.

While David Williams, a teamster for P. Burns, coal merchant, was driving over the crossing, the Montreal express dashed into the cart, instantly killing Williams and the horse he was driving. He was a widower, about 50 years old. Last night Thomas Kroner, aged 22, one of the crew of the schooner Ariadne, now lying here, started for a row to row ashore. A few minutes afterwards those on board heard cries for help, but not having a boat were unable to leave the vessel. Eraser has not been seen since, and it is supposed he has perished.

LATEST FROM UTEHIX, fall of a meteorite Cariboo caught at a strange cloud appeared in the sky over this city which gave forth two distinct flashes of light, accompanied by loud noise. At first it was thought to have been lightning, but the phenomenon was not solved till this afternoon, when news reached the city from Chateau Richer, fifteen miles below, that the same thing was observed there, and which is said to have been caused by the fall of an aerolite upon the farm of Mr. Lefrancois at that place, which buried itself in the earth to a depth of 5 or 6 feet. It has been dug up and found to measure about five feet in circumference. Last week an immense shoal of fish were observed in the river opposite the city, so great in number as to stop a canoe which was being pulled over the river. Half of the fish were dead. It is thought that they were leaving the upper waters for the gulf and were driven back by the recent heavy storms and killed. Cariboo are seemingly plentiful in this district at present. Yesterday two of these animals, growing bold, entered as far as the church door at Chateau Weber while service was being held. One of them was captured. A violent snowstorm set in early this morning and continued all day. This evening the weather has become milder. The men who have been acting as a watch at the departmental buildings were regularly sworn on Saturday. Heretofore they had no legal authority to make arrests. The Hon. MIDIOCITY IN HIGH PLACES, a writer in Truth maintains that there is not a really clever man among all the crowned heads of Europe or their families. The King of Spain, he declares, has stopped all his intellectual growth since he became king. The Austrian arch-dukes have elegant tastes, but no ability. The King of Italy has nothing beyond occasional spurts of fine feeling; and in the royal houses of Saxony, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, and Bavaria there is nothing above a second-rate dilettante. The brother of the Empress of Austria, who is an oculist, is no exception, for though he has astonishing dexterity and firmness of hand, and a good memory, he is only a seeker after pathological curiosities, and is completely at sea on a new case. The rest of the family, like the empress herself, grew up amid horses and dogs, and she learned to speak English from her stableman. The same is true of the nobility. The bats used in the Faubourg St. Germain are smaller in circumference than those of the Quartier Latin. There is much talk about an intensely disagreeable but very powerful novel entitled A Mummers Wife, by a young Irishman named George Moore, and a controversy of a lively character is stirred by the announcement that Mudie, the king of the circulating library business and the autocrat of the novel businesses, is boycotting the work. It is announced that a similar measure has been dealt out to Marion Crawford's To Leeward, to Katharine Bauer's Revelations, on which Labouchere drew so largely to abuse the Queen's relatives; and to a small primer, by Prof. Stuart, the successor of Fawcett as member for Hackney, on the ground that he is an atheist. MISS FORTESCUE'S LOSS, Miss Fortescue, the pretty actress who recently obtained $50,000 from Lord Garmoyle for breach of promise of marriage, has again become engaged to Mr. Harry Quitter, the bank clerk and musical critic, whom she jilted for the son of Lord Cairns. Mr. Quitter has been a faithful and persistent suitor, and he renewed his offer of marriage to Miss Fortescue long before it was certain that she would ever get a farthing from Lord Cairns. It is understood, however, that he is perfectly willing to accept the $50,000 as the bride's dowry. THE PREVALENCE OF PRIZE FIGHTS, Sir Win. Vernon Harcourt, secretary of state for home affairs, is said to be horrified at the frequency and brutality of prize fights in England. He has resolved to suppress them in future, if possible, but his success is doubtful, as the magistrates persist in inflicting only nominal penalties as long as the fighting is fair. ALPINE STORMS, The snowstorms in the Alpine regions of Switzerland have been unusually early and severe this season. Many unwary tourists have been caught on the mountains, and the great hospital of St. Bernard is full of wounded people. Many travellers are still missing, and it is believed several of them have been frozen to death.

"18841218","TIUS GAZETTE MONTREAL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1884 UNITED STATES DESPATCHES Possibility of Another Telegraphers' Strike METHODIST CENTENARY PASTORAL New York's Proportion of the Trade of New Orleans, December 17 The telegraph operators say a telegraphic strike is imminent today or tomorrow. Operators here are ready to give the signal. Plans have been matured for some time, and New Orleans will sound the key note, being the most favorable point, as it would be difficult to get operators here in case of a sudden strike. It is claimed that the brotherhood is more capable of making a strong fight than ever before, having shaken off the traitors who caused the disastrous failure of the last strike. The grievances complained of are that those who were promised $85 a month get only $60 to $70, and operators have to do extra work on weekdays without pay. The manager of the Western Union Co. says he does not believe there is any foundation for these statements. He admits that there is some dissatisfaction about the cutting off of emergency and extra work, but does not believe it warrants a strike. He says there are many idle operators who would not hesitate to take any place offered. General Eckert has been appealed to to remedy the grievance, and it is probable no action will be taken until his reply is received. It is said the checkers on duty at the Western Union office here quit work yesterday afternoon, owing to the introduction of a scrub at $15 a month. A Methodist Pastoral Baltimore, December 17 The pastoral address of the bishop read at the closing of the centenary conference this afternoon is a Christian congratulation on the state of the church, and a review of its doctrine and future mission. It is addressed to the Methodist people of the United States and Canada. The address urges the maintenance of family religion, speaks of the Sabbath as a pillar of Christian civilization, and says a spiritual church without a Sabbath is an impossibility. The address concludes: The grand march for the conquest of all lands for Christ has begun; the voice of the Lord bids us go forward. We dare not accept a secondary place, with our schools and colleges, wealth and culture, social power and vast numbers; we must have a large share in the world's evangelization. A love feast closed the proceedings of the day and of the conference. Threatened War In the Month Baltimore, December 17 Capt. Forbes, of the barque Albermarle, which arrived yesterday from Rio de Janeiro, says when he left (November 12th) there were rumors of war between Brazil and the Argentine Republic. The Conde d'Eu had gone to the frontier to investigate, and it was thought the matter would be settled by the cabinet when he returned. An American who had arrived from Buenos Ayres told Forbes that the Argentines had 120,000 men ready to throw across the frontier as soon as war was declared. Cold Wave in the West Chicago, December 17 Reports from all points in the West and Northwest indicate severe weather. Trains over all lines are delayed. West of the Mississippi snowstorms prevailing threaten serious blockades. The polar wave extends south to St. Louis. Heavy snowstorms and blizzards are reported throughout Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Dakota and Montana. The thermometer here ranged from 2 to 1 below zero today. It was 17 below zero at Duluth this morning. A Scurrilous Letter Writer New York, December 17 It is said Henri M. Braem, who is well known in society, has been compelled to resign as vestryman in Trinity Church because he became known as the author of various anonymous letters of a scurrilous character which have been received by members of August Belmont's family during the last few years. It is stated that a woman in Boston wrote the letters under Braem's instructions. The latter's motives are unknown. A Powerful Gun Sandy Hook, December 17 A shot weighing 152 pounds was fired from a Haskell multicharge gun this morning with 116 pounds of powder. The velocity of the shot was 1,801 feet per second, the elevation 81 degrees, range 654 yards. The muzzle energy of the shot was 3,422 foot-tons. This is the most powerful shot yet fired from this gun, and much exceeds that of any gun in the world of the same caliber. The Trade of the Year New York, December 17 The annual report of the chamber of commerce shows the value of the merchandise imported into the United States for the fiscal year ending June last was $705,123,000, of which there passed through New York $486,355,000.

More refreshments were here taken and the members then resumed their tramp via Dorchester, Mountain, Joseph, McGill and Alexander streets to St. Patrick's church, where they participated in the midnight mass. Next Monday evening will be the ladies' night of the club. THE KORTUKAL TRAMP. Despite the stormy weather on Wednesday evening sixty-five members of the old Tuque Bleue met at the gymnasium and tramped over the mountain to Lumkin's. As was natural in the face of the heavy snowstorm prevailing, the track was very heavy, but this only put the trampers in better humour, and by the time they reached Cote des Neiges it would have been hard to have found a more contented lot of men in the world. At Lumkin's they were joined by forty-one more, making 100 in attendance, a very good muster for Christmas Eve. In honour of the occasion a special programme had been prepared and was exceedingly enjoyed. Mr. Willie Brown, a new member, at once became a prime favourite by the manner in which he accompanied the piano on his violin, an addition to the musical strength of the club which had been much desired. In addition to the usual dance a number of new choruses were gone through, the solos being sung by Messrs. Rodden, Fraser, Lowe, Hildin and Brodie."
"18841227","S, December 20, The government steamer Latimowne, Capt. Guildford, from Sable Island, brought the sole survivor of the French brigantine A.H. of St. Malo, Capt. Lemarchand, which was wrecked near the west end light on the night of the 11th. The vessel was bound from St. Pierre-Miquelon with a cargo of fish to Boston. A heavy gale and thick snowstorm on the 19th drove the vessel toward Sable Island. Her captain, seeing the west end light, endeavored to take off shore, but a heavy squall striking the ship she was thrown on her beam ends, upsetting her. Four men were immediately washed away. The only survivor, with the captain and another of the crew, then took to the boat, which was at once capsized and the occupants swept ashore in the surf, two being drowned. The survivor managed to crawl to the door of the lighthouse and gave the alarm. Searchers were immediately sent out and four of the crew were found on the shore. The captain and second mate, Baptiste, and steward, were found near the wreck. Another body, that of a sailor named Noblong, a native of Brittany, was found three miles distant. Those missing are Arcueland, Geraldine, seamen, and an apprentice named Donahue. The vessel was completely broken up. The name of the first mate, who was the only one saved out of the crew of seven, is Thomas Huct, of St. Malo. THE SPA"
"18841229","TUB CATTLE TRADE A large export cattle trade is being carried on over the lines of the road, and is rapidly increasing. There are at the present time on Canadian ranges about 60,000 head of cattle, 8,000 head of horses, and between 10,000 and 20,000 head of sheep. As these are very profitable the numbers will be nearly if not doubled this time next year. In consequence of this large increase in the grazing interest there will be no more shipments of dressed beef from Ontario in the spring, nor of any ordinary beef cattle, but instead of that there will be a considerable export trade in cattle from Canadian stock farms. At the present time (Mr. Kerr said) better beef could be bought in Winnipeg than was offered in Toronto, and at lower prices. COAL MINING IN THE NORTHWEST A fourteen-foot vein of bituminous coal has been found at a depth of 135 feet at Crowfoot Crossing, 700 miles west of Winnipeg, and this will be developed during the present winter. The Gait mines at Fort McLeod are being opened up, and a narrow gauge line is being built from the mines to Medicine Hat, a distance of some 110 miles, and when this is completed the distance from the mines to Winnipeg will be about the same as that from Crowfoot mines. The coal from the Saskatchewan mines, which come in at Stair, 660 miles from Winnipeg, now supplies the latter city with its bituminous fuel, and is being rapidly developed. Some very valuable deposits of anthracite coal have been discovered at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, and it is anticipated that the importation of coal into the Northwest will cease next year. At the present time anthracite coal from the Pennsylvania mines is selling at $10 a ton, and the bituminous coal from the Saskatchewan mines at $7.50 per ton. IMMIGRATION AND BUSINESS A little over twenty-one thousand immigrants, Mr. Kerr said, had arrived at Winnipeg and had settled in various parts of the Northwest. Business in Winnipeg and along the whole line of the Canadian Pacific Railway was generally good, though there was no great boom. It was simply in a good condition, and there was every prospect that the state of affairs there would show a considerable improvement in the coming spring. TILL CATTLE READ THE ROCKIES The winter climate near the foot of the Rocky Mountains was no more severe than in Ontario, and though there were heavy snowstorms in that neighborhood and enough snow remained on the ground to make excellent sleighing, the chinook winds had a peculiar effect on the snow which did not melt under their mild, gentle influence, but simply disappeared as if it were absorbed by the atmosphere. Mr. Kerr appeared enchanted with the country, and said that the cold in Winnipeg was not felt any more severely than it is in Toronto. A Canadian exhibit What Canada can do in the way of agricultural produce may be seen also in the Arcade gallery, at the lower end, a position possibly which does not admit of the stand coming under the general observation it deserves. The exhibit is that of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, to which the Marquis of Lorne on Monday devoted considerable time. Two or three years ago some extraordinary vegetables from Manitoba were exhibited at the Smithfield Club show, but the present collection is the best we have seen in London. The same company's show at York was universally admired; the winter of Manitoba, as is now well known, is severe, but when the land is unlocked things grow apace, and the soil, with ordinary attention, will produce almost any crop. The quality of the roots and grain speaks for itself in the samples on the stand. The apples from the southern portion of the province of Ontario are lovely to look upon. Amongst the exhibits, thrown in to please the eye, are a bison head, fish from the lake, and a prairie hen. The really practical objects are the wheat, oats, barley, peas, maize, linseed, beans, potatoes, carrots, swedes, beetroots, mangolds (the largest nearly 50 lbs in weight), onions, and wild prairie grasses, grown by emigrant settlers along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The wheat is of high quality, the average yield being 30 bushels to the acre, and the average weight 64 lbs per bushel. London Daily A text THE BESTIGOTUCHE SALMON CLUB Chester A. Arthur elected President and a plan laid out. The Grand Restigouche Salmon Club, whose membership comprises Chester A. Arthur and most of the eminent fishermen of the country, held a meeting last week, at which the annual report of the treasurer, superintendent, and board of directors were presented. The board of directors reported that in March Daniel Fortier and Oliver K. King, the Secretary, visited Fredericton and took a lease for the year of 22 miles of the Upper Restigouche, and a lease of the Patapedia Branch for one year. New leases were also taken above and below the clubhouse, the latter controlling the fishing on Willie Belle Island, for terms of three and five years, so that at present there is fishing in that neighborhood for from nine to eleven rods, while the upper waters, including Indian House and Tom Brook, and exclusive of the Patapedia Branch and Tros Point, will afford angling for from eight to nine rods. The board also reported that Messrs. Sage, Lawrence, Rogers, and Drummond had very kindly given the club the use of their water during the latter part of the past two seasons, and that about 15 members and guests availed themselves of their privileges during the last summer. The board recommended the purchase of that portion of the Kiligar, the Kiligar in New Canaan between Toad's Brink and Tom Brook, including the Kiligar and part of the River, which is now under a new government for sale next spring, if it is to be purchased at a reasonable price. It was announced that a reciprocal arrangement has been made with G. Fleming for next year that will allow members of the club to fish in his water, thus providing additional angling for four additional rods. Steps are now being taken to purchase, if possible, Mr. Drummond's valuable waters at the mouth of the Patapedia with one or two pools lower down, and if this negotiation is successful the board is of the opinion that there will be waters for angling for all members who visit the river next season. The number of members who visited the clubhouse last season was 26, and the angling guests numbered 22. These killed 322 salmon and 124 grilse. During last winter an act was passed by the New Brunswick Legislature at the request of the club, authorizing the club to hold real estate in that province. Resolutions were adopted that the directors be authorized to make such purchases of lands and fishing privileges and make such leases as shall in their opinion be advantageous to the club, and that the annual assessment be placed at $200. The following directors were elected for the coming year: Chester A. Arthur, A. Lawrence Mason, John L. Cadwalader, George K. Pollock, Oliver K. King, James C. McAndrew, Wirt Dexter, Henry W. De Forest, William Hall Penfold, Daniel T. Worden. The directors elected the following officers: President Chester A. Arthur; Vice-President A. Lawrence Mason; Secretary and Treasurer Oliver K.

At Laconia, N.H., a shock lasting half a minute was felt on Friday night. Madrid, January 3 An earthquake shock was felt yesterday on the coast of Valencia. Fresh shocks were also felt in Granada and Malaga. The people in those sections live in but built in the field and in carts and carriages in the streets. In the vicinity of Granada, numerous sulfur springs ceased to flow when the first shocks were felt, but burst forth again on the following day with loud subterranean explosions and a volume of hot vapour. They have since flowed as before. The scene at Alhama is described as terrible. Despite the loss of property, MADRID, January The king has subscribed $5,000, the queen $2,000 and the infanta Isabella $1,000 for the relief of the earthquake sufferers. The balance of the fund raised for the Murcia flood sufferers has been devoted to the same purpose. Official statistics show that 673 corpses have been recovered from the ruins in the province of Granada and 269 in Alhama. In the latter city, 1,400 houses were destroyed. At Alhama, 160 persons were killed and 280 injured, and at Arena del Rey, 135 were killed. Additional earthquake shocks have occurred in various parts of the southern province. At Loja, Alhama, Jaen, Velez and Malaga fissures in the earth have appeared. Great panic prevails among the inhabitants owing to the continuance of the shocks. The people throughout Teruel, Granada and Malaga sleep in railway trains or occupy tents at night; they congregate about huge bonfires. Religious processions are frequent. In some villages, the inhabitants are suffering from famine. The bodies of the unburied victims are beginning to decompose. The ruins of Alhama present an imposing appearance. The upper portion of the town was built upon a hill and fell on the lower portion. The bodies of over 300 victims have already been recovered. Ten thousand head of cattle were killed. All the public buildings were demolished. Seven thousand persons are camped in the fields and hold religious services in the open air. The remaining houses at Alhama are in a dangerous condition and it will be necessary to blow them up. A meeting was held by the military and literary societies and clubs and journalists of Madrid, and it was decided to raise a relief fund for the benefit of the sufferers. A heavy snowstorm accompanied by severe frost prevails here.

"18850119","D. McEachran, manager of the Walrond Cattle Ranch Company, of which Sir John Walrond, Bart, London, Eng., is the chairman, from the official inspection, a representative of the Ontario Cattle Association stated on that gentleman last evening. Dr. McEachran was busy in the home comforts of his snug parlor after a long time with a sleigh drive in the great Northwest, with the thermometer registering 51 and 63 below zero. Dr. McEachran told his experiences as follows: On the evening of the 13th of December, accompanied by Mr. Louis O. Barnett, the doctor left Montreal for the Walrond ranch, which is situated about forty miles west of Fort McLeod. He experienced the full brunt of the cold snap in December, and when he reached Winnipeg it was 51 degrees below, at Moose Jaw 63 degrees, at Regina 50 degrees, at Calgary 40 degrees, and at Fort McLeod about the same register. Notwithstanding the opposition from snow drifts, the train journey from Winnipeg to Calgary was accomplished in pretty good time, and a delay of a few hours was the only inconvenience of the trip. By constant firing up and a liberal use of fur coats and buffalo hides, the doctor and his companion made themselves very comfortable and enjoyed a very fair Christmas dinner in the Pullman car. The sleigh drive was accomplished in two hours. The thermometer was 40 degrees below, and taking this into consideration, fifty miles per day was very good traveling. The first day's run was on a bob-sleigh, but on the second day wheels were resorted to. The cold at McLeod was intense and the snow lay about eight inches deep. Cattlemen were anxious, and everyone was expressing a hope for a Chinook. Old-timers ventured predictions from their experience with the confidence of the weather prophets. New Year's greetings were mingled with wishes for the hot wind. The drive from McLeod to the ranch was the most disagreeable of the journey. A start was made on the morning of New Year's Day. When halfway, the wind began to rise. It soon increased to the fury of a gale, and carrying the light powdery snow before it, the high bench lands were left almost denuded of snow. In such a storm, a drive across a trackless foothill was far from a pleasant experience. Soon after arriving at the ranch headquarters, Dr. McEachran set out for his work of inspection, and he expressed the great pleasure which he experienced in finding the 9,000 head of cattle on the ranch in excellent condition, streaming from the shelter of the river bottoms and spreading out on the hillsides. Not a single animal had succumbed to the severity of the storm. With the exception of a few of the oldest cows, which calved late in the fall, the herd never was in better condition. The cowboys, who had returned from visiting all parts of the ranch during the day, brought in similar cheering reports. ""Then it is not true that losses have occurred amongst the cattle?"" asked the representative. ""No losses to speak of,"" said the manager of the ranch; ""the cattle never were in better winter condition."" Dr. McEachran and Mr. Garnett, after spending a few days on the ranch, returned to Fort McLeod. When the report was made, the cattlemen were highly pleased and returned congratulations on having escaped the loss they expected from the cold and storm. The Chinook wind came; the temperature moderated, and on the 5th of January, the snow had disappeared from the highlands. On the 7th of January, the thermometer was 48 above, which shows a variation of 88 in a few days. ""How do you think the present snowstorm will affect the cattle?"" ""They did not get the storm out there at all."" It is the prevailing opinion amongst old residents that most of the winter is over, and if this prediction proves true, the future of the Foothills country as a cattle-raising district is assured. The calf crop of last year on all the ranches was large, and the ranchers will be warranted in proceeding with the contemplated increase of herds and improvement of the stock. It has improved beyond all expectation since it was taken up in 1861."

The heavy snowstorm which has prevailed in the Western States has prevented the movement of freight from the east, and in consequence of this the Canadian roads west of Toronto are blocked with freight trains. This is especially the case at such points as Guelph, Stratford and Sarnia, and the yards there are crowded with empty and loaded cars waiting to be moved.

The special correspondent of the New York Journal of Commerce, writing from Chicago on January 20th, says: The wires have informed you of our great snowstorm and terrible cold weather. Of course the moving of grain and live stock has been at a standstill, and for the present week corn, wheat, hogs or cattle will not come on the market very freely. Before the present storm the area comprising the winter wheat belt, the States of Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, were thoroughly wet by the continued heavy rains, the ground alternately freezing and thawing. The general opinion, founded upon natural causes, was that since the 1st of January until the 15th instant winter wheat sown broadcast had been more or less injured, and that the drilled wheat so far had withstood the sudden and severe climatic changes. All know one fact with a degree of certainty, and that is that the general condition and final outcome of this most important crop is not as favorable as it was at this date in 1884. South of the Ohio river winter wheat is even more backward and unpromising than north of the river. This situation was brought about by a long dry term, and not over 50 percent of the winter wheat was seeded by the 1st of November. The present cold weather must have been exceedingly trying upon the wheat in the States of Kentucky and Tennessee. With the country roads bad all over the winter wheat belt, the movement of wheat has been extremely small. Wheat has not come out as was expected. An opinion which seems founded on facts is that the winter wheat farmer very largely marketed his crop at harvest, and that local mills are able to absorb the remaining surplus. The spring wheat situation shows very little change since the opening of the year. Sad but true, the farmer, as he generally is, sold his wheat at the bottom and since then, rise is no better off. Early in the season the spring wheat grower could have been paid 10 cents more per bushel than he finally took. Ever since the corn crop matured and the authoring begun I have been a firm believer in the fact that it was very largely over-estimated. From the very best corn growing regions of Illinois corn has already been imported for feed from Kansas and Nebraska. In Southern Illinois there has not been in many counties more corn raised than will carry them to another crop. Iowa says the same, and Kansas says that she will be as bare of corn in the summer of 1885 as she was in the summer of 1884. Another very significant fact about corn is that the receipts do not increase as the price advances. The very telling point in corn is that no matter how large the crop of 1884 was it is not backed up by a bushel of corn of a preceding crop. There is no corn point today in the Northwest where cribbed corn in the hands of dealers bears any comparison in volume with this date in 1884. AUSTRALIA. Sydney, January 20, The coal trade is more unsettled because of competition from within and competition from without. A break in the selling combination is predicted, and manufacturing interests will not rest from protesting until much more favorable rates are obtained. The Reading company has thirty-two mines idle. All the companies will have completed the mining of their January quota this week, and shall resume for the rest of the month. Last year the Wyoming region produced 51 percent of the total production for the year, 30, 71 percent. Stocks are increasing. Local and outside manufacturing requirements are being withheld as far as possible. Bituminous supplies are increasing and likely to be very greatly increased by the opening of spring. Very few bituminous contracts are being negotiated in eastern markets. The Clearfield operators are hampered with freight rates, and no relief is in sight from the new Vanderbilt line. Everything is unsettled, and the trade is expecting interesting developments within a few days. The small industries are improving under a slowly improving demand, but a conservative pricing policy will be continued until there are better prices. Wage reductions are probable in the coal and iron industries, and until a level is reached no widespread improvement can be looked for. THE IRON MARKET REPORT. Philadelphia, January 20, The iron market is unsettled due to failures, and trade prospects, which begin to brighten, are temporarily hindered. There are no large orders on the market in any branch, and but few inquiries during the week on which much hope of large business might rest. Everywhere the spirit of improvement is exhibited. Railroad requirements are light. Shipbuilders, machinery and car builders are all waiting, complaining of not enough material to continue the work in hand. The iron works throughout the interior of the state are only partially employed. An occasional large pig iron order is reported, on a basis of $11 to $12 per ton, and $13 for foundry; in the meantime consumers are all waiting, afraid to buy in the present unsettled condition of things. The demand for finished iron is much behind, and on a large order the cutting renders the sheet and plate mills at a standstill for small orders. The structural mills have negotiations pending for large lots; pipe mills are securing good orders. Merchantile mills are finding sale for more material. The demand for steel mill billets improves, though prices weaken. Nails are in the range of $2 to $2.50. In Western markets are weak. Southern iron orders are going out, and southern furnaces have in many cases large contracts. Bridging iron inquiries are presented, but contracts are bound to close. Confidence needs strengthening before much in the way of business is done."
"18850126","ACKII 0 pm It has been ascertained that a large quantity of explosive matter was placed in the great ornamental gates leading to the crypt under Westminster Hall. The gates were blown off the hinges, all the windows on the north and south sides of the immense building were blown to atoms. The concussions shook down the firm roof, annihilated soot of dust made such a dense cloud that the room in the lobby silhouettes were for a time thick as flakes in a blinding snowstorm. They were propelled in many cases with dangerous force. They cut and stripped the leather from the seats and tore out and scattered the horsehair stuffing all over the house. The statues of King William IV and King George IV in Westminster Hall were overturned. The fact that an unusual number of ladies visited the parliament buildings today has given rise to a suspicion that the miscreants who perpetrated the outrages were women, or men in women's attire. The attendants say parcels were carried by many of the women, and they seemed to be very careful in guarding them. Count Minister, the German minister, and the Lord Mayor visited the scene of the explosion at the Tower. The crown jewels and regalia stored there were not damaged. The explosion was preceded by a blinding flash, followed by great clouds of dust. Additional guards have been placed on guard tonight round the Tower, the parliament houses and all the public buildings."

"18850209","S, February 7 A serious accident and fire that is nearly being accompanied by loss of life is reported to-night on the Intercolonial railway between the Richmond and North street (city) stations. The day express from St. John was coming into the city an hour and a half late, having been delayed by heavy snow on the track. When about halfway between the Richmond freight yard and the city, and while proceeding at a rate of about five miles an hour, she struck the frog of a rail that was covered with solid ice. Two locomotives in advance with their tenders and the baggage car passed safely over it. The next one, a second-class car, ran off the track, crashed as a portion of the switch gear, and proceeding a few feet further toppled over an embankment ten feet high. It made two revolutions in its descent, landing on its side, lying partly in the water and partly on the beach. The postal car, immediately behind the second-class, was dragged by the latter down the embankment while the other end rested on the top. Fortunately, there were but two passengers and a brakeman in the second-class car, and only three aboard the postal car. Those in the former escaped serious injury in a most miraculous manner, sustaining not even a cut or bruise. While speaking of this, they were stunned for a moment by the violent pitching, but as soon as the car came to a standstill they clambered through the windows and gained the ground. The men in the postal car also received only slight injuries, but their danger was not nearly so great as was that of the people in the main-class car. The passengers on the first-class car, numbering about fifty, which brought up the rear of the train, were greatly alarmed and almost panic-stricken. Conductor K, who was standing on the front platform of the first-class car when the other two went over the embankment, jumped to the ground when he saw them go over. He complains of a slight injury to his legs by sinking the track, but otherwise is thought to be all right. Immediately after the accident, the train was gone through by the officials to see that everything was right. About ten minutes later flames were observed issuing from the second-class car lying at the foot of the embankment. The distance from the city fire service was so great, and the fire being hard to get at, by the time water was got on the whole car was a mass of flames and was completely destroyed. The trucks of the postal car were badly damaged by the accident. A few rails were torn up. The track cannot be repaired until morning. The heaviest snowstorm of the season raged in this region today. Traffic through the streets of the city is greatly impeded, the drifts in many places being nine and ten feet high. Snow began at 11 o'clock last night and fell thickly up to 7 o'clock. The steamer Saturn, the weekly mail boat for Liverpool, is ready to proceed to sea, but is detained awaiting a subsidence of the storm. The mails and passengers from the upper provinces are onboard. Should the steamer Alaska, replaced by the City of Chester at New York as making for this port, be on the coast, she will not likely be able to enter the harbor tonight. The steamers Newfoundland and Miranda, which arrived tonight from St. John's, report seeing nothing of the vessel which is towing a heavier line steamer, supposed to be for the purpose of towing the tug. Captain Mosher of the barque Lady of the Lake, which arrived about the first of the week from Liverpool, has been arrested on a charge of cruelty and ill-treating members of his crew and compelling them to undergo such exposure that several were seriously frostbitten. On a warrant for his apprehension being issued, Mosher disappeared, but his capture was effected in this county today by Detective Power. THE EGYPTIAN CAMPAIGN In all the Anglican churches yesterday, a special prayer for the preservation of the British troops in Egypt and the success of the expedition, prepared personally by the Archbishop of Canterbury and sent to bishops of the Church of England all over the world, was read. Pulpit references were also made in many of the churches to the crisis, and special hymns were sung in many cases, including ""God Save the Queen,"" which was sung in a most hearty manner. In most of the Presbyterian churches there were also special prayers offered, and references were made in the sermons to the gravity of the situation. Colonel Van Straubenzee favors sending a Canadian regiment for service in the Soudan. He advocates choosing only the most efficient men, picked from the various volunteer regiments who have served at least one full term. Those gathered from all parts of the Dominion would, he thinks, make a fine regiment, and could be quickly got together. He also thinks that the movement would be very popular both in Canada and England. Rev. Mr. Friedlander, in the course of his sermon at the St. Constant street synagogue on Saturday morning, made some very patriotic remarks on the Egyptian campaign. Taking for his text, ""Honor thy father and thy mother,"" he went on to say that there is another whom we are to honor, respect, and love after God and our parents, and that is the sovereign of our country where the Jewish race enjoyed liberty and freedom. The Hebrews had great freedom under the British flag, and had they draped their synagogue with crape to express their regret at the fall of Khartoum it would not have been at all out of place nor have been a desecration of the Sabbath. The British were now trying to benefit the human race by the war in Egypt and had not self-aggrandizement for their object. His hearers were not to judge between Christian and Mussulman as to creed. They knew that where the British ruled there was liberty and equal justice to all mankind, whilst a cloud of darkness overhung the Mussulman's country. The Rev. Mr. Friedlander finished his address with a warm appeal to them to pray for a speedy deliverance of the British in Egypt from danger, and that God would deliver them from what might be a desperate death, even as he had delivered the children of Israel of old."

This afternoon, however, the limit was quoted at 11c as to size of lot. There is no yellow obtainable now under 11c, and the range of values is from 11c up to quality, the low grades being very scarce. A good fair trade has taken place during the past week within range of the above quotation. The late dullness in syrup has given place to a more active demand, and a good many sales have been made at from 21c to 50c per gallon as to quality, there being not little at the latter figure in the market.

Lumber: The volume and form of demand is about the same as for some time past, business being quiet and the distribution very moderate for all outlets. Good desirable lumber is steadily held, but on the low grades the valuation has been shaded. The following are the prices at the yards, large quantities being quoted lower: Pine, 1st quality, $35 to $40; 2nd quality, $22 to $24; do, shipping culls, $14 to $16; do, 4th quality deals, $10 to $12; do, mill culls, $8 to $9; spruce, $10 to $13; hemlock, $9 to $10; ash, run of log, culls out, $13 to $17; bass, run of log, culls out, $12 to $18; oak, $40 to $50; walnut, $30 to $100; cherry, per M, $60 to $80; butternut, $25 to $35; birch, $15 to $22; hard maple, $20 to $25; laths $1.85; shingles $2.03 to $2.25; do cedar, $1.50 to $3. Leather: The situation in leather has presented a quiet appearance and from no quarter can the demand be called full or anxious. The distribution has been of an ordinary character, without activity in any department. In fact, the receipts have run ahead of the outlet, which has caused some accumulation of stocks, and the quantity now offering is more than ample. Prices are nominally unchanged but to move round lots would require concessions. Sole leather has been arriving freely and has a somewhat easier undertone. A moderate trade has been done in black leather and the feeling is barely steady. A lot of 1,000 hides upper sold at 34c.

It is expected the reservoir will be dry by morning, and if a fire should occur the result would be disastrous. Hopes are entertained that the engine will be repaired and in running order again by tomorrow afternoon. At the annual meeting of the Industrial Exhibition association, the reports showed that the profits of the last exhibition over all expenses had been $7,127.

LATENT FROM ICEBERG: The Lake Simon accident-Know block and insolvency law delegate. Quebec, February 11: Nothing is yet known as to who are the victims of the Lake Simon holocaust, reported yesterday. The coroner was unable to leave on account of the snow blockade, and the telegrams which have been dispatched to St. Raymond for information have received no satisfactory reply. From the latest despatches received today it seems that the bodies, which are being conveyed to St. Raymond, are still snowbound at Black River. All incoming trains today were late, owing to the recent snowstorm. The Lake St. John and Quebec Central did not get in at all.

He at least made use of expressions which now come under that head.

The cooperative movement in central Italy has had a marvelous growth. In 1892 the cooperative societies in the United Kingdom comprised 911,000 members. In 1892 the number had increased to 1,341,000, and the probability is that during the last three years there has been a further expansion. The increase of capital is not less remarkable. In 1892 the capital amounted to £12,000; it is now close upon £11,000,000, and the sales amount to no less than £25,000,000, showing a profit of nearly £1,500,000. These figures indicate a vast improvement in the condition of the working classes, among whom the movement has been most general. The Boston Commonwealth says: A quiet tone runs through the reports from all sections, and it is evident that the volume of business is not up to expectation. The heavy snowstorms in the west have materially impeded the transportation of merchandise and have also prevented traveling salesmen from getting the usual orders. The industrial situation is still in an unsatisfactory condition. Enforced reductions of wages, strikes, and stoppages of works continue to be reported, and the outlook for next month is not encouraging. While there has been a gradual improvement in the general tone of business, prices have not gained much strength, and manufacturers in nearly all branches find it necessary to curtail expenses or stop work for a time. All this is in keeping with the process of liquidation, which has been in operation for some time past, and is a requisite preliminary to the restoration of business, which is confidently looked for in a short time."

On the continent, though the iron and steel trades are no worse, they are certainly not improving. In the early part of the current month, Belgium orders for 9,200 tons of steel rail were given out, the average price being 130f, as against 131f for 14,000 tons in July last. The Belgium production of pig iron during 1884 was 738,105 tons (32,500 less than in 1883), and of this, 542,372 tons were forge quality. Of finished iron, the output was 468,185 tons (10,000 tons decrease on 1883), and of steel ingots, 179,803 tons (increase 2,100 tons on 1883). Belgian bars are now reduced to 18s per ton, and the common forge pig to 32s per ton. In Germany, the demand for rails is well maintained, and the price for home consumption is now 37 per ton, but for export, very much less is accepted. The Boston Commercial List says: Reports which have been gathered from various parts of the country show no substantial improvement in the general business situation. In some places, distribution has increased and a hopeful tone prevails, whilst in most others, trade is still backward, owing to the extremely cold weather. In the north and east, severe snowstorms have made the roads almost impassable and trains have been blockaded for several days. In the west, there is a better movement, but the rough weather is a hindrance. In the south and southwest, a moderate spring movement is reported, but it is not up to expectations. In most of the manufacturing districts, the outlook is unfavorable, owing to the enforced idleness in all branches of industry. The cotton mill operators are steadily curtailing production and the indications are that a large portion of the machinery will be idle during the summer months unless there is a radical change for the better in the goods market."

Joseph Ruben, a fellow-countryman, who took them in charge Mr. Ruben stated that that morning his attention was called to the men, who were standing at the corner of McGill and Notre Dame streets, speaking to the passersby He first spoke to them in German, then in French, then tried several dialects, and at last spoke to them in Polish The men instantly replied with a shout of joy and gathered around him and began all at once to tell him their story They said that they had gone to Hamburg to go to America People understood them there, and sold them tickets Then they came to New York, and no one knew what they said, but they showed their tickets and were sent to Montreal They got here yesterday morning, and had some breakfast, but their money was all gone and they could buy nothing more They wandered up and down the streets, but though they spoke to many persons no one understood what they meant At last, when too tired to walk farther, they lay down by the side of the road In the morning they started off again, and wandered on until they met their fellow-countryman Mr. Ruben at once supplied their need for food as well as he could, and took them to the Austrian consul, Mr. Edward Hhullze Further than giving the men some dinner he could do nothing for them They were taken to the provincial emigration office, but it was a holiday and nothing could be done for them there,

Mr. Louis Lesage, superintendent of the Montreal waterworks, who has returned to the city from a tour of inspection at the junction of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence rivers The western portion of the island, for a distance of four miles long and a considerable width had been completely inundated and all the houses and farms in that strip flooded The first rise took place at midnight, on the 18th of February, when the worst storm of the season was at its height, the ice below the Cascade moving suddenly en bloc towards the island Striking the shore it piled up in many places thirty feet high The front was torn down from a large stone house where some fifty people, men and women, were assembled celebrating the feast of St. Valentine They were all driven into the storm and made their escape through a perilous lake to some houses on an elevation about a mile away All the stock in the stable, consisting of four head of cattle, a valuable horse and some smaller animals, were drowned in their stalls The river continued to rise until by noon the next day all the people at that portion of the island were driven from their houses to find refuge on higher ground some distance off About the 10th of last month the second rise took place, also in a heavy night storm It came on suddenly, but the people were more prepared for it, and the loss was consequently not so serious Numbers of cattle, however, perished, and the people, especially the sick, suffered much The loss by both floods is estimated in aggregate at about $12,000 The people whose property has been damaged are said to

snowstorm which would have been more seasonable in January or February than in the month of April when people are anxiously looking out for the springtime The snow fell heavily all day and vehicular and pedestrian traffic was impeded to a large extent The streets were pretty much deserted and what with the war news and the storm business was very dull The trains coming into and leaving the station were remarkably well on time The Canada Atlantic, due from Ottawa at 11:35 a.m., was only thirty-five minutes behind No. 4 east, due at 12:02 p.m., was twenty minutes late The Delaware &

The drivers of all the trains report deep snow on the track in many places, especially south Snowplows, however, were put into requisition throughout the night, and the track kept open Some difficulty was experienced in moving the cars for the making-up of trains at the station early in the morning, the snow drifting on the shunting tracks nearly as fast as it could be removed, but all eventually went right through the energy of the station officials The Canadian Pacific trains were also on time, the authorities announcing that the storm has not in any way interfered with the transport of the troops to the Northwest The effects of the storm may most conspicuously be seen on the river opposite the city The roads to St. Lambert, Laprairie and intermediate points are completely blotted out in

A detachment of troops is going to Handoub to protect the railroad work and to form a zareba. The whole force is likely to follow on Wednesday. TWO FATAL TRAGEDIES, A Man Mays His Wife's Paramour and a Boy's Home Incident, St. Thomas, Out., April 4, A horrible tragedy was enacted at 1:15 this afternoon. Samuel Mitchell, employed as a teamster at Reiser's brewery, came to the residence of Chief Fewings, while that officer was at dinner, and, taking a huge Colt's navy revolver from his pocket, handed it to Chief Fewings with the remark: I have just shot Alex McIntosh. He is lying dead at my house on Isabella street. I could not stand it any longer, and I want to give myself up. The chief accompanied Mitchell to the house and found the body of McIntosh lying in the hallway upstairs dead, the brains oozing from a hole in his head. The chief at once took Mitchell to the lockup and notified a coroner. Mitchell is well known in the city, and formerly kept a hotel at Lawrence. McIntosh, until recently, kept the hotel at the Air Line station, Aylmer. He had long been intimate with Mitchell's wife, and when Mitchell came home this morning and found McIntosh there he lost control of himself, and the tragedy was the result. Hamilton, Ont., April 5, Will Mitchell, aged 10, son of the cook at the Boys' home, was accidentally and fatally shot today by a young companion named Herbert Gaivin. The latter had been working and saved enough from his allowance of pocket money to buy a pistol. Investigation after the accident discovered that two other boys at the home were the possessors of pistols. The boy Gaivin is in custody. An inquest is to be held.

A heavy snowstorm visited Calgary last night, said to be the most severe of the winter. Capt. Steele's scouts, under command of Lieut. Coyelle, will go tomorrow north to the crossing of the Red Deer River, one hundred miles. They will be preceded by Rev. Mr. McDougall with four faithful scouts acting as an advance guard of the route. The officer has instructions to take possession of the settler's house nearest the ensuing of the Red Deer, fortify it and hold the position at all hazards until the arrival of troops. The mounted rifles will leave as soon as possible. Capt. Cotton, at Fort McLend, was sent orders yesterday to send a detachment of twenty mounted police from McLeod to Calgary together with one 0-pounder gun and this detachment with twenty mounted police from Beaver Creek, K0, will leave as soon as possible for Edmonton. Capt. Cotton has received instructions not to await the arrival of the company of the 92nd Battalion from Winnipeg which under command of Lt.-Col. Osborne Smith, arrived at Calgary this afternoon, one company being left at Gleichen, about twenty-five miles on this side of Calgary, near where there is a large number of Blackfeet camped but to have Inspector Perry make forced marches there. The 116th Battalion, under Lieut.-Colonel Hughes, with the balance of Col. Smith's battalion and a part of the Alberta Mounted Rifles, will advance to Macpherson's Coulee on Monday. General Strange will take command in person. Macpherson's Coulee is twenty miles north of Calgary. A number of the 65th are under arrest for plundering the stores of their officers, including whiskey, and will be tried by a court martial ordered to be held by General Strange. A mounted policeman is also under arrest for threatening to shoot Lieut.-Colonel Hughes of the 65th. Fifteen thousand rounds of Winchester and forty-five thousand rounds of Snider cartridges arrived by train at Calgary yesterday. There was a general inspection of the 65th day by Major-General Strange. BLACKFEET ON THE WARPATH A despatch from Medicine Hat this afternoon reports that a band of Blackfeet had left their reserve and started on the warpath. It is also reported, from the same source, that the Blackfeet and Piegan and Bloods will rise in a body and put on war paint should the command under Gen. Middleton be defeated in the first encounter with the rebels, which it is expected may take place tomorrow. There are no troops and only six mounted police at Medicine Hat, the region through which the rebel fugitives are sure to escape to the United States if a reverse is suffered on the Saskatchewan. AT BATTLEFORD A telegram from Battleford announces that a small party of Indian horsemen yesterday drove off Wylde & Hauke's cattle from their ranch north of the Saskatchewan. There is no immediate prospect of following until reinforcements arrive. Harry Nash's house, nine miles north of Battleford, was burned yesterday. Other fires were seen last night in different directions. Two Indians seen near the barracks by half-breed women were pursued by the police, and when last seen were crossing the Saskatchewan on a cart. The Stonies threaten to burn the barracks at Battleford and then move south. No news has been received from Fort Pitt since the third, which makes it hopeful that the fort holds out. A courier sent up was captured last week and despatches taken from him, but another will be sent out tomorrow. A contingent of Gen. Middleton's force is expected at Battleford on Saturday week. Everything is ready for action when reinforcements arrive. It is estimated that 1,000 head of cattle and 600 horses have already been carried off by Indians around Battleford. Instructor Peyne's body was chopped up after the murder and thrown around the barnyard of the reserve. Instructor Jefferson is a prisoner with Pondmaker. The number of persons within the stockade at Battleford barracks is now 506 souls. The Crees are awaiting the return of Big Bear from Fort Pitt before again attacking. DESPATCHES FROM CALGARY state that in consequence of disquieting reports from the Red Deer country, where small bands of Crees are said to be wandering about fully armed and annoying settlers, Lieut. Carjill with ten of Oswald's scouts will go north this morning. The Edmonton stage has not yet arrived, and it is hoped that it was never sent out. Mr. Lucius, Indian agent at Peace Hills, took refuge with his family in Edmonton, and probably deterred. Omney has brought in five Cree Indians who have volunteered their services. They will join the scouts at Calgary."
"18850427","C, Lieut Doucet, wounded in the last encounter, was doing well, but would have to be sent to the hospital. A fearful snowstorm was raging in the Saskatchewan district, and it was extremely cold. The troops were also reported eager to meet the insurgents. There is an evident discrepancy between this report, which would indicate that the rebels had left their position on Friday, and those received from Clarke's Crossing yesterday, the latter stating plainly that General Middleton was still in his camp near the battlefield, and tending to show that the half-breed occupied the ravine. No fighting seems to have taken place on Saturday. Gazettik, A despatch was received this morning by Mr. Hay, M.P., from his son, who is with General Middleton's forces, stating that seven men were killed and fifty-five wounded in Friday's engagement. Two of the wounded are since reported to have died. CAMP (UNNIL), 1 Mill Anl, Ihh. Since my last letter, dated Fort Qu'Appelle and Touchwood, the troops have made excellent progress, and we are now encamped on a beautiful slope overlooking the two ridges that dominate all that locality, known in the town or village, or whatever else it may be called, of 1 1 n m I m tllt. The route of the troops through which we have passed are, reported and forlorn, an empty habitation with nothing but the name indicated on the map. To the back of the army these have been great disillusionments, and they have trudged on daily from point to point with the hope of adding a few luxuries to their exceptionally hard fare by having up any of the trailing stores which they had expected to encounter. Fort Qu'Appelle, much the same, has been the only place of importance through which the troops on this division have passed. Touchwood, on the northern limit of the hills known under the same name, consists of merely a Hudson Bay post of only one building. The next structure met with was a low shed in the middle of the Salt plain, a large tract of country forty miles in width, extending northward from the Touchwood hills on the road to Humboldt. This building is used as a halfway house or stopping place for the mail carrier and stage conveyance. I do not know exactly how to convey in words to your readers the really creditable work of the troops now in the field during the past week. First it must be remembered that it was widely asserted and assented to by the majority of those supposed to be well informed on the subject in Winnipeg, that from Qu'Appelle troops could not possibly reach Clarke's Crossing on the South Saskatchewan in less than six weeks. On Monday last, the 6th instant, the General commanding ordered the advance from Fort Qu'Appelle. The force then consisted of the first battalion, Winnipeg Rifles, 300 strong, the Winnipeg Field Battery, two guns and 60 men, so scouts and about 20 Winnipeg sharpshooters. Along with this force were taken ammunition and supplies for thirty days in wagons. The line of march, along the prairie trail, of this comparatively small force extended nearly three miles in length. The troops were all required to march on foot and they have, every day for a week now, been on the march. The roads for heavy marching have been something terrible, and the sufferings of the volunteers have been such as cannot be readily conceived. The first day's march, on Monday, 6th inst., was short, being only nine miles. The start, however, was made late in the day. Camp was pitched that night on a wild, bleak country, low and wet as a sponge. An hour after, a severe windstorm and a heavy snow blizzard from the north set in and continued all night. The cold was so intense that a few of the men suffered any such. The next day's march was a surprise to the physical extremities of the corps, being nineteen miles, through frozen water eighteen inches deep and over a frozen road, which for wagon ruts would put to shame many of the roughest of corduroy roads to be met with in the thick townships of an Ontario constituency. Although personally, as a correspondent, I enjoyed whatever comforts and privileges the expedition afforded, yet I could sympathize with the sufferings of the men of the 90th battalion, many of whom are personal acquaintances of mine in Winnipeg. The 90th, to a great extent, is composed of young business men, either in commercial or financial pursuits of their own, or employed in banks, law offices, railway and government offices, besides a great many of the respectable tradesmen and mechanics of the city. They have been accustomed to no such work in their lives as that which they have lately performed, and even those who have seen their hardest days either home-steading or surveying for the Dominion, have never done so much hard work in their career on such miserable and inadequate food. Of the fare, I shall say something later on in this letter. The boys of this corps, however, set out with a determination to go through everything and show the people what they can do. This is partly prompted on account of the ""COLD SEND OFF"" they received from the citizens of Winnipeg when marching from their headquarters to the station for embarkation. This send off might be accounted for from the fact that there was at that time very little excitement over and very little importance attached to the rebellion in the west, and when the troops marched out of Winnipeg the people fully expected to see them march back again in a few hours. Nevertheless the boys feel aggrieved all the same, and hope to make as good a name for themselves as possible as a sort of retaliation. After the second day's march the blisters on the feet were so numerous and the stillness of the limbs so great that they began to feel that a halt would be appreciated. A battery from Quebec being a day's march behind the general ordered a halt on Wednesday in order to rest the force and allow the battery to catch up. During the previous week's delay for supplies at Troy and Fort Qu'Appelle the troops had improved so much in their steadiness and drill that on the inspection by Gen. Middleton on the day of the halt he was so pleased that he caused the following brigade order to be published to the troops: ""The major-general commanding has been pleased to express his great satisfaction with the steadiness and steadiness of the 90th when inspected by him this morning, and with the manner in which the regiment has performed the arduous duties devolving upon it since called out for active service."" (Signed) ""M. P. R. S. Lt.-Col. Chief of the Staff."" On the next succeeding days, from Thursday the 8th instant to last evening the 13th instant, the troops were rushed forward without a rest, leaving at 6 a.m. each day and marching until 5 p.m. The distance covered each day was on an average 22 miles. To bank clerks and law students twenty-two miles day after day in succession in heavy order is no small feat. The country passed over was full of sloughs of water, intersected with small creeks three feet deep. Through this water the force plunged, in their short laced boots and leggings, and for the next few yards the crossing of water in the legs of the men's boots told of additional blisters to appear that night. When I speak of the inclement weather, I wish it to be understood that their lot has been a single unmitigated struggle along the line. The men seem to have rallied and they do their work and duty well. The add to the discomfort of the day's march, the men have the labor of pitching their tents and the guard and police duty each night. The work of a volunteer here just at present may be laid down as follows: Rise at 5 a.m., have a light breakfast of a cup of tea and a ""hard-tack,"" strike tent and march at 6 a.m., all done within half an hour. The march during the day is continuous with the exception of a short halt at noon for something to eat and rest. The halt for the night is generally made at 5 p.m.; tents are pitched, supper prepared and the first two hours is all taken up in drying socks and clothing over the camp fires. The nights are very cold, the ground is wet, and in spite of all the drying efforts of the men, their hands in the morning are generally frozen stiff, and they are thus obliged to tramp ahead in instruments of toil until the warmth of the sun and the water in the sloughs have again made them pliable. In addition to the day's heavy marching, a certain number of the men are detailed off to act as an outlying picket. This necessitates additional tramping throughout the night, and at present the picket comprises almost a fourth of the force each night. On Friday night last the force reached Touchwood, and on Saturday morning the great Pall Plains lay before. This region, nearly 15 miles in width, is a veritable desert, and crossing it during the present windy weather caused a decided depression in the spirits of the men. For the whole distance there was not a stick of wood, and nothing but alkali water to drink. Brigade orders were issued to old-timers to avoid drinking any of the water. The halt Saturday night in the middle of these plains was a disagreeable experience. Lime juice tea had been issued to the men that night, and the fires, owing to the small supply of wood the ox wagons were able to procure, were very meagre. The next day, Sunday, tired as the men were, they gladly prepared for the regular all-day march, in order to get out of such a homeless region. With the endurance and willingness of the men in these heavy marches, to which they were evidently unaccustomed, the general was so well pleased that he caused another complimentary order to be issued to the following effect: ""The major-general has seen with much pleasure, the willing manner in which the troops under his command have endured the long and wearisome marches which have been required of them, and he feels sure that should the troops become aware that the safety of women and children depends upon their efforts, he may in the future fully rely on their exerting themselves to the utmost."" It is an oft-repeated saying here that the army in the field never hears anything of the news even in their vicinity, such is the strict and cautious discipline as regards the suppression of the publication of the news in the camp. But the reports of several small skirmishes in the north and the massacre at Frog Creek had just been passed around, and the allusion in the orders to the RESCUE OF THE PRISONERS made the boys determine to do their best cheerfully. Thus with the exception of the day's halt referred to, the march from Qu'Appelle to Humboldt, 85 miles, has been covered in just one week, or about a fifth of the time currently prophesied in Winnipeg before the departure of the troops, and we are now just two days' march from Clarke's Crossing in the South Saskatchewan. The average rate per day has been about twenty miles. This is decidedly big work. ""Otter's guide,"" the Canadian authority, I believe, on most military matters, says that troops when not on forced marches, should begin with six miles a day and then work it up to thirteen miles a day, and the latter distance should not be exceeded if possible. Otter's estimate is evidently child's work, and the rate performed here means business. I may say that the general says we have not begun to do any forced marches as yet. The boys who are halted at this point for a day are particularly cheerful under the influence of a warm sunshiny day and beautiful scenery. The band of the 90th accompanying the force is playing lively airs and camp songs to make all cheerful and gay. Two days ago half of the Toronto School Infantry joined us forty strong and we are now waiting for the 10th Royal Grenadiers of Toronto who will possibly join us tomorrow. The march will then again be resumed. Of course nothing definite is known outside as to the whereabouts of the enemy, further than an engagement may possibly take place the day after tomorrow (Thursday). A few of the mounted police who rode back to meet us report Kiel and his force about forty miles to the northwest of us. The consequences of an engagement will no doubt be severe. The fighting will be what might be called bush fighting. It is hardly possible that Kiel's force will meet us in any organized shape. Were they to do so, they would, without hardly a doubt, be dispersed in a very few minutes by a few shrapnel shells from the field guns. Were they to attempt to throw up any fortifications the shells again would be very much in our favor. But it is generally thought throughout the camp that the enemy will be scattered individually in the bush all over the country. To fight a body of men so scattered means A PRETTY SERIOUS BUSINESS. If our force charges in any one particular place, the benefit derived would be the possible killing of one or two of the enemy while the bullets, no doubt, would be pouring in from many hundred different directions. The troops here do not expect to handle the enemy in a hand-to-hand conflict. The tactics pursued by the general will be to keep in the clear country as much as possible and advance all the time, and thus to draw out the enemy from the bush. The presence of ""A"" Battery lends a great amount of confidence and the force hopes that the engagement will be such as to enable the artillery to work to advantage. Although there is every chance of an early engagement, there is nothing which the soldiers in this camp think less about than the coming fight. The heavy marches, their hunger and the poor food supplied them occupy their attention to such an extent that they neither find the time nor the inclination now to think about any engagement which might soon arise. I remember well Colonel Burnaby's description of his cold drive across the snows of Russia on his way to Khiva, where he describes that all he and his followers could possibly think of was what they could get to eat at the different posts. Here there has been some great mistake made in the matter of the men's food. The food issued is simply tea and hard tack and canned beef. So far, on two occasions, I believe there was a slight change, when some fresh beef and a little pork were issued. But in the main canned beef, hard biscuit and tea has been the sole fare. The men, unused as they are to the fare, would not perhaps grumble so much if a sufficient ration or allowance was issued to them. For instance, during the first three days' heavy marching when the men felt the necessity for good nourishing food, all that was issued to them was three ""hard tack"" biscuits each a day, which had to do three meals or one biscuit a meal. The government ration is a pound and a half or ten biscuits a day. The men also complained at so much canned beef being given to them instead of pork. The canned beef, the manufacture of a Chicago firm, has a peculiar flavor. It is dry and seems to contain very little nourishment. At least the men tire of it to such an extent that they cannot eat sufficient to give them any very great staying quality. I have known the food of the men as I understand them has been quite a howl over the matter in the Winnipeg press. That they do not wish for any exceptional favor. They require no luxuries, but they modestly ask merely for what they are no doubt entitled to, that is the government rations, including pork and beans. As it is just now, they complain bitterly of the canned beef and hard tack being their only food. The Commissioner of the department controlling the matter should remember that the men in the field are nearly all volunteers, and not regulars. They are for the most part gentlemen, who have given up most lucrative positions in the city. They have thrown up their business interests at almost an hour's notice, and have voluntarily entered the field for their country's cause in suppressing the rebellion, and they should be treated to some extent if not liberally at least fairly. These volunteers are making sacrifices patriotically to an extent that can hardly be realized. Of the men, two-thirds of the corps went either making or held situations worth to them from two to fifteen dollars a day. A great many of them had businesses of their own which they at once closed up. A number of them small tradesmen and storekeepers, with whom I have some acquaintance, turned the key in their shop doors and came on with the boys. The officers are a great many of them lending bits of business, who at interests will suffer to a considerable extent. When the rebellion commenced they went eager to go to the front. They felt it was the chance of a lifetime to serve in that capacity, for Canada does not indulge in many campaigns, and this promises to be the most serious military affair that Canada has yet had to deal with. So all who had the fortune to belong to the corps were glad of the opportunity to take a hand in. When doing so, however, they had no idea of how serious the matter was, nor of the great length of time they might be called upon to endure. I venture to say that to the majority of the young men at present engaged in this campaign the cost individually will range from three hundred to a thousand dollars. Many of the young lawyers' and tradesmen's businesses will have to be built up again. In consideration of the sacrifices made, a private's pay of fifty cents is but a poor remuneration, and by the volunteer it is accepted as being merely nominal. When he came out here, the private did not come to earn a PERMANENT REWARD. He knew full well that there was no money to be made in the business. The sacrifices, though no doubt hard to bear, were accepted with a sort of trusting willingness. It was duty's call and the interests of the country in the main, besides a certain amount of chivalry inherent to a more or less extent in most of mankind which no doubt prompted them to rush to the ""tented field."" But in doing so even the small pay of fifty cents should be left intact. In a case of this kind the volunteer should not even be called upon to furnish his own boots and socks. If the roads and the weather were ordinarily favorable the matter would not be so important. But during the present season the volunteer has found it necessary to draw extra boots from stores every few days, his other pairs having become so stiffened and frozen in the early morning that it is almost impossible to get them on. The hurried marches, the picket work at night and the tired spirits of the men do not permit them to devote any time to the work of drying boots and socks over the camp fires. These extra boots have been charged to the account of the men, and, in fact, almost all the necessaries actually required as necessaries are charged up. On active service, under such circumstances, if anyone is entitled to reward it is the Canadian volunteers and the Winnipeg corps, who have so nobly sprung to their posts when called upon. No doubt a great many of the papers will make what political capital they can out of the treatment of the men. But, after a careful observation, I cannot see what political capital can be made. There is no doubt that, under the hurried circumstances, the best that could possibly be done has been done. The men feel that many things have been accidentally overlooked, and consequently have not indulged in any petty grumbling, but have accepted the discomforts of the campaign as cheerfully as possible. On the boot question, the government, no doubt, will assume the cost. The men, while they have not claimed anything more than they feel they have a right to, expect to be treated squarely on that point. In time of peace the volunteer provides his own footwear, as he properly should, but during active service, now going on, the boots are worn out in the interests of the country and if the footwear amounts to more than the whole of the private's pay, he should not be called upon to put his hand in his own pocket to meet the difference. There has been quite a great deal said as to the advisability of issuing a daily ration of liquor to the men. The General has adopted Wolseley's plan, I understand, and discountenances such a course. There is probably a great deal of truth in the fact that if a man grows accustomed to take a daily ration of half a gill of liquor each day, he would, after the campaign, become or likely to become a confirmed ""ration drinker."" But while a daily ration would not probably be well, yet I believe that after a long twenty-four miles march through mud and half frozen water, to a dreary camping ground, with a snowstorm looming up from a forbidding array of windy clouds in the southwest, that little of something strong would go ""TO THE RIGHT PLACE."" There are men in the camp who have been strictly temperate for years, who feel that such a ration under the circumstances described might well be called a necessity. No one can be capable of judging on this question, unless put through a similar day's hardship during cold weather to see how he would feel on the matter. One thing is certain and that is a daily ration of grog is not at all necessary, although it stands open how much life and spirit an occasional ""horn"" would throw into the tired spirits of the men. I might say here that so far the men of the volunteer corps have done the same work, and endured the hardships equally as well as the regulars, namely, A Battery and the Toronto School of Infantry. This may be somewhat of a surprise to many who are fond of running down the qualities of the Canadian militia. But the conduct and the work of the militia here in the field have been eminently satisfactory to the Major-General and Lord Melgund. In fact, the general has on several occasions expressed his surprise at the manner in which the 90th has performed its arduous work. The general is already, to a certain extent, popular with the boys. At the campfires he readily joins in the choruses to their songs, and has even unbended sufficiently to dance to several Irish airs played one evening by the band. The boys like him better for it too, although they meet his keen-eyed glance with some trepidation when on inspection or parade."

It is believed he was murdered by a countryman named Agustin Gilardo, who was preparing to return to Italy. Gilardo knew Killippo had money, and recently imported him for little. It amounted to fifty but was exchanged over. The man was last seen in company with Gilardo and one Hugo. Francisco thinks he was choked and then disfigured by hand. A detective left for New York, the authorities to head off Gilardo, while Caruso went back to Chicago to secure the rest of his remains. How Hoytston got even, New York, May 7 On Tuesday night, Hoytston took a late torpedo shell, in which he placed a brick, and approached the British man-of-war Gurnet, intending it to the hull. He was discovered while leaving the vessel, and shouted to the officer on deck that there was a torpedo on the bottom of his ship. The lark pursued Hoytston in a steam launch, capturing him and several friends who accompanied him in a small boat. The party were taken aboard the Gurnet as prisoners, but were released when an explanation had been made and the torpedo shell examined. Hoytston says the British admiralty once made fun of his rubber dress, and he wanted to get even with them. A New War Balloon, Pittsburgh, May 7 The ordnance board of the United States army has recommended the construction of a minister war balloon for the use of the government, and General Russell Thayer, the inventor, has received instructions to begin his work. The board recommends that a balloon of seven tons ascending force be constructed, and that trials be made with it. It will cost $10,000, be the largest balloon ever constructed, with a diameter of 60 feet and length of 135 feet. The ""Dirigible war balloon,"" as it is called, is a cigar-shaped machine, pointed at both ends, and sails through the air longitudinally. The balloon is said to be the most destructive implement of war known to modern science. Thayer claims that he can lay a city in ashes with it in a night. A Catastrophe, Janksville, Wis, May 7 A powerful windstorm set in from the Northwest last night. The thermometer dropped to 28 degrees above zero, making ice a quarter of an inch thick. Tobacco beds suffered severely. The thermometer stood at 158 degrees above zero today, which is the coldest ever known in May. At Des Moines, Iowa there was a hard freeze last night, ice forming three-fourths of an inch thick. Fruit and growing crops were injured.

Gen. Lumsden had made arrangements a long time previously to fix his camp at Tirpul. The British commission started for Tirpul directly after the Penjdeh battle. Reaching the Parapamisus mountains, a terrific snowstorm rendered progress slow and many camp followers were lost. The defeated Afghans retreated by another route. The Penjdeh Valley is a most fertile oasis and lovely country with splendid pasture land. In the springtime, the ground is literally carpeted with flowers. The valley abounds in game. The party killed one hundred and fifty pheasants daily. The Murghab abounds in waterfowl. The hills are stocked with wild gazelle, antelope, wild sheep, and pigs.

"18850515","AS REGARDS THE OTHER LINES, the Montreal and Champlain Junction is only 62 miles long. The profit on that altogether has been 7,000 for the year; the Midland is 472 miles long, and the net profit on working it was 12,000, while the charge for interest was 1,500, but the net value of the Midland increased which was 8,000, and the revenue derived from it held with 9,000, so that the profit arising from it was 12,000. Taken in that way, and without accounting for the interest on the remaining capital, the profit was 6,000. The Champlain, Georgian Bay and Lake Huron, 171 miles long, reported the net profit of working it was 1,000, and the charge for interest only 1,500. The net value of the traffic interchanged with it was 10,000, and the revenue from it held 1,800. Without including the interest on accounts, the net profit on working that line, and on the traffic interchanging with it for the year was 15,000. Then there is the Wellington, Grey & Bruce. Although it did not earn the interest paid on the bonds, it brings us a very large amount of traffic, and there is thus a large net profit derived from the control of that line; but, taking the principal and subsidiary lines together, the net profit on the interchange of traffic and the working of the lines, without counting any revenue from the traffic held in them, is something like 3,500 for the year. Now, gentlemen, I would ask anybody to look into that subject, and to satisfy himself that we have not been accumulating a great number of lines as a burden upon this concern. Well then, there is another point, as to the fusion between the GREAT WESTERN AND GRAND TRUNK companies. There are certain people who say that the union was a very serious mistake, that the Great Western got the best of the bargain, and that the Grand Trunk Company made a great mistake in joining them. Now, if there is one thing we have done which is a wise measure it is the fusion of those two companies, and this is the time when the wisdom of that fusion has been tested, because if the Great Western had formed, as it was intended to form, and in it would otherwise have formed, a union with the Canadian Pacific Railway, and had been working with the Canadian Pacific during the past year, I do not know what would have been the result to the separate companies. I am sure neither of them could have earned the full interest on their debenture stocks. I have had a good many figures prepared which show that, but I do not think I need trouble you with them, because it is merely necessary to state it in order that it may be admitted. Well, I suppose you will expect me to say a few words about the Canadian Pacific Railway. It was always held out to us that that was going to be a very serious competitor to us. It would have been so if we had not joined the Great Western Company; but as it is the competition has not been so very serious. Now the Canadian Pacific, let us distinguish between the Canadian Pacific and the Ontario and Quebec Railway, which is promoted to a great extent by the same individuals; I do not know how the Canadian Pacific, whether it will earn any interest for itself, is another question can fairly be considered to be in a position to guarantee another line. However, the Ontario and Quebec is a line said to be guaranteed by the Canadian Pacific. If the Canadian Pacific Railway had been constructed merely from Montreal on the one side to the Pacific coast on the other, nobody would have been more disposed to assist the government, or to assist THE CANADIAN PACIFIC COMPANY, than we all should have wished to do, directors and proprietors. There is nothing we desire more than to contribute to the prosperity of Canada in every way by extensions of railways through that country, and by opening out those lines which will tend to develop the resources of the Dominion. But, gentlemen, when certain gentlemen connected with the Canadian Pacific Company were foolish enough to undertake the making of the Ontario and Quebec railway, for the purpose of uniting it with the Credit Valley railway and with the Great Western of Canada, and for the purpose openly boasted and proclaimed of competing with us between Montreal and Chicago, then they naturally set us all against them. Now that the Ontario and Quebec railway has been opened, I have been at a good deal of pains to attempt to discover how much we have lost by the competition with the Ontario and Quebec railway during the last year, because it is a matter of great interest to us all. We can ascertain how much we ourselves have lost on the traffic between Montreal and Toronto, and we can ascertain what the Ontario and Quebec have been carrying. We have taken some pains to do that, but it is very difficult to see how we are to arrive at another factor in the question, and that is, to ascertain how much we should have lost in consequence of the commercial depression existing in Canada if the Ontario and Quebec railway had not been constructed. That is an element which it is excessively difficult to arrive at, but, making all the allowance that we can in the matter, after all the calculations we have gone through, as far as I can understand, the total gross loss during the past half year in consequence of competition with the Ontario and Quebec has been something like 20,000, and the total net loss to the company has been something like 6,000. That is not a matter which should make us very uneasy, or which, looking to what the Canadian Pacific may do with or without the Ontario and Quebec, need give us any great alarm for the future. They may do us as much good by opening out a vast country and bringing fresh traffic into Canada as they will do us harm, and very likely they have got their own struggles to go through. Their troubles will begin, their difficulties will really begin, when they have their lines finished from ocean to ocean. You may form some idea of what it will be to work a railway for 3,000 miles, with very little population upon it, with a very severe climate to contend against, and with all sorts of disadvantages, much greater than those we labor under. Now, gentlemen, the question is not how much profit they will make in the first few years, but how much loss they will experience in working their railway? and how much more money they want now to complete it? We all know they have been beseeching the government of late for further assistance to complete the line, but have not yet succeeded. It appears to me the best thing for them and for us, and for the government and I think it will come sooner or later would be that the Canadian Pacific company should be taken over by the Canadian government, and when that happy time arrives there will be an end to undue competition, and the Grand Trunk proprietors will all be glad to help the government in any way they can in making as little loss as possible in working the Canadian Pacific railway. But the most important point I have to call upon to-day is the question of pooling arrangements. We can stand a good deal of commercial depression, we can stand a good many snowstorms, but we cannot withstand the effects of unprofitable rates for the vast amount of work that we are doing. No company can successfully struggle against such a state of things. Therefore the important matter we have to consider, and the all-important matter I want to deal with when I get out to Canada, is how it is possible we can induce the various companies who are competing with each other, and with us, to adopt some system which shall prevent this suicidal competition going on any longer. The history of the pooling arrangements for the last half-dozen years is a very long one, and I will not weary you in going through it. There are a good many east-bound pools for east-bound traffic on railways merging upon New York, pools from Chicago and other places on railways running towards New York. Then there is the Chicago and New York pool, and there are also pools from New York and from New England, while some of these pools have been in an utter state of disorganization, and some are still working. For instance, we pool with the New York Central to New England. That pool is still working, but many of the other pools are utterly inoperative. About two years ago the Grand Trunk originated a nothing system to do away with the undercutting of rates, and the Grand Trunk have resolved nothing since ever than to continue it, even at a diminishing rate. If I have told you in a manner over and over that we thought it was a good policy even to accept less than we were entitled to, if only the other companies could be induced to adhere to the regulations of the pool. Well, we have gone upon that principle. We have found time to claim receipts even a great deal lower than we have been entitled to. We have, during the last three or four years, lost very largely on account of traffic which we have overpaid in the pool, and to even up, as it is termed, and on account of the pool expenses. We have been able to carry a great deal more traffic than we have been entitled to under the pool, and have been obliged to pay over excess. Notwithstanding this we have not attained the object for which the pool was established. The object of the pool was that rates should be maintained and that the lines taking part in the pool should carry an agreed share of traffic, should not cut the rates to balance the traffic; and during the past year, I do not hesitate to say, we should have done better if there had been no pool, rather than in working under such a state of things as has been experienced. HARROW, KENT, June 1, 1897. Ten years ago I was attacked with the most intense and deadly pains in my back and I suffered, leading to the end of my toes and to my brain! Which made me delirious! From Agony! It took three men to hold me on my bed at times. The doctors tried in vain to relieve me, but to no purpose. Morphine and other drugs had no effect! After two months I was given up to die! When my wife heard a neighbor tell what Hop Bitters had done for her, she at once got and gave me some. The first dose eased my brain and seemed to go hunting through my system for the pain. The second dose eased me so much that I slept two hours, something I had not done for two months. Before I had used five bottles, I was well and at work as hard as any man could, for over three weeks; but I worked too hard for my strength, and taking a hard cold, I was taken with the most acute and painful rheumatism all through my system that ever was known. I called the doctors again, and after several weeks they left me a cripple on crutches for life, as they said. I met a friend and told him my case, and he said Hop Bitters had cured him and would cure me. I pooh-poohed at him, but he was so earnest I was induced to use them again. In less than four weeks I threw away my crutches and went to work lightly and kept on using the bitters for five weeks until I became as well as any man living, and have been so for six years since. It has also cured my wife, who had been sick for years; and has kept her and my children well and healthy with from two to three bottles per year. There is no need to be sick at all if these bitters are used."

In accordance with the order of the union at the meeting last night, the builders' laborers to the number of 500 struck work this morning. They afterwards held a mass meeting in the Queen's Park, which was attended by a thousand workingmen. Addresses were delivered and the strike thoroughly organized. The pick and shovel men went out with the laborers, and individual stonemasons and bricklayers absolutely refused to accept material from the few non-union laborers secured by the masters. Eight masters have already notified their acceptance of the increased rate, but none of them are members of the Masters Builders' Association. That association will fight to the bitter end. The action of the major of the Salvation Army to provide 200 laborers has caused indignation among the men. The stonemasons' union met tonight and resolved not to accept material from scabs. The bricklayers' union will decide on Wednesday night. Another of the bosses has surrendered, telling his men to be at work on Monday morning.

"18851015","I HIE GAZETTE, MONTREAL THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1888 MONTREAL THURSDAY OCTOBER 15 THE HEALTH QUESTION BEFORE THE COURTS An important victory was gained yesterday when the legality of the action taken by the Provincial Board of Health was sustained by Mr. Justice Taché. A writ of injunction was prayed for against the city by the municipality of Mile End, in order to prevent the use of the Exhibition building for hospital purposes. His Honor had no hesitation in deciding, in the first place, that the municipality of Mile End had shown no interest entitling them to come into court. And he went further, and disposed of the main question; that is to say, whether the Federal or the local Legislature has jurisdiction over matters of public health and the enactment of regulations rendered necessary by the presence of disease of a contagious nature. In this point His Honor set at rest, as far as the decision of a court can settle any question, all doubts which have been entertained as to the legality of the measures taken under the provincial authority. The learned judge holds that the Federal jurisdiction extends merely to quarantine and the establishment and maintenance of marine hospitals, and that the Provincial Legislature has control generally over all matters of public health. The Federal act of 1850 is therefore constitutional only so far as it relates to quarantine, and is without effect in so far as it assumes to legislate on health regulations. In a word, therefore, the authority of the Provincial Board of Health has been sustained, and the uncertainty which existed as to the legality of their action has been happily removed. It may be added that the promptness with which the learned judge has disposed of the question submitted to him is a cause for congratulation in the present emergency. The case involved the examination of several statutes, and was not free from difficulty, yet the decision was given within a few hours after the argument. FIGHTING THE DISEASE The civic authorities are now confirmed in possession of the Mount Royal hospitals, and can proceed unhesitatingly in the work of occupation. The number of inmates is increasing with rapidity, and it is satisfactory to learn that the Board of Health has determined upon pursuing strictly the policy of isolation. By no other means can the spread of the disease be so surely checked, and when the board determines to practically quarantine every infected house in which the patient declines removal to the hospital, it will have the support of public opinion. It is gratifying, too, to know that a committee of medical men of high standing has been named to supervise the management of the hospitals, and report upon the same from time to time, it being of great consequence that confidence in the administration of the hospital should exist. Dr. Gardner, formerly house surgeon of the General Hospital, a physician of large experience and excellent reputation, has accepted the position of superintending medical officer of the Protestant wards, a fact calculated to promote confidence in the efficiency of the hospital management. Altogether the work goes bravely on, and promises from this time forward to earn a reward in the gradual disappearance of the epidemic. NEWFOUNDLAND POLITICS Our Newfoundland correspondent sends a most interesting account of the state of political parties in that island. The split in the Protestant party, and the threatening of Catholic supremacy, have caused the retirement of Sir William Whiteway, the premier, and the selection of Hon. Robert Thorburn, a prominent merchant of St. Johns, as his successor. By this move the Protestant majority is harmonized, but the people at large lose the services at the head of the Government of one of the ablest and most competent statesmen the country has known. The religious quarrel in Newfoundland is evidently deep-rooted and bitter, and in their blind and stupid fanaticism, in their crass intolerance, men fling away opportunities big with benefits for themselves and their country. The experience in the case of the island is by no means singular; even in Canada, indeed in this very city of Montreal, we have learned how intensely men can hate one another for the love of God, but it is a sad commentary on our boasted progress under free institutions and popular government that in a general election the sole consideration of the electors should be the sectarianism of the candidate. Our correspondent pays a high and well-deserved tribute to the late Premier, Sir William Whiteway, and suggests that his appointment to the governorship of the island, rendered vacant by the death of Sir John Glover, would be a fitting recognition of his services to the colony. The appointment would assuredly be an excellent and deserved one, but we must dissent from some of the reasons for which it is urged, as for instance, Sir William's intimate acquaintance with the politics, the wants, the aspirations of the people. A governor requires no qualifications of this kind for the successful discharge of his duties; it is enough that he is intelligent, well-disposed, willing to learn and anxious to please. The military will look after the uplift of the people. Then it is by no means certain that Sir William Whiteway's long participation in party struggle does not rather unfit him for the office of governor, or more properly speaking, make the acceptability of his appointment somewhat doubtful. These objections, if they may be so called, are made to show that our correspondent is not occupying firm ground in his criticism of the present method of appointing colonial governors, but with him we recognize fitness for the office in the late Premier of the island. AN AFRICAN NEGRO REPUBLIC The republic of Liberia, to which the Rev. Moses Aaron Hopkins, of whose remarkable career we recently gave a sketch, has just been appointed United States minister, is one of the most extraordinary philanthropic experiments of the present age. Its name implies the object for which it was established. The idea of testing the capacity of the negro race for self-government had been broached early in the present century by some of the more sanguine of the abolitionists of the time. It was not, however, until after the accession of James Monroe to the presidency that a method was proposed for giving it practical form. In 1821 a body known as the American Colonization Society undertook to procure on the west coast of Africa a piece of territory sufficient for the settlement of, at least, as many freedmen as there were then, or were likely to be for several years in the United States. They succeeded in securing, by arrangement with the native chiefs, about 10,000 square miles in the vicinity of Cape Palmas, between Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast. The efforts of Zachary Macaulay in that part of the continent to provide for the moral and material welfare of the blacks may probably have led to its adoption for the purpose of the larger enterprise. It was not until 1821, after President Monroe had entered upon his second term of office, that the colony was formally established. It was only in 1847, during the presidency of Polk, that the settlement was declared an independent republic. Its existence as such was first acknowledged by England and afterwards in succession by the various European powers, but the United States did not follow the example till 1861. In 1873 the population numbered about 720,000, of whom only 19,000 were colored people from America, the remainder consisting of native Africans. The capital, Monrovia, so called after President Monroe, has a population of about 13,000. The Liberians have churches, schools, missions, and all the ordinary machinery of civilization. The constitution is modeled on that of the United States. There is no restriction as to the number of terms (of two years each) for which one person may be elected president. There are four ministers in the Cabinet: Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Attorney-General and Postmaster-General. According to some authorities, the commerce of the country is nourishing and agriculture is successfully practiced. Sugar, coffee, cotton, maize, wheat, barley, oats, tomatoes, cucumbers, tamarinds, lemons, oranges, guavas, pineapples and African peaches are among the products, besides many of which they export palm oil, gold dust, ivory and hides. The revenue is derived chiefly from customs duties. In 1871 the Government contracted a loan of half a million dollars, which was issued in England, but no interest has been paid on it, the republic being actually bankrupt. Accounts differ as to how far Liberia has proved a successful test of the capability of the negro to advance in the path of civilization, unaided by the white man. Some writers maintain that it has disappointed all the hopes of the founders; others, without being enthusiastic over the result, consider it, on the whole, satisfactory. One strange reproach against the community is its permission, or connivance at, slavery so largely prevalent among the aborigines of Africa. It is generally conceded that the insertion in the constitution of a clause refusing citizenship to any white person has been a fatal mistake. Those who are most intimately acquainted with the Southern negro are convinced that, deprived of white guidance and example, he is sure to sink in the scale of civilization. In Hayti vast numbers of the natives have relapsed into barbarism and paganism. In an article in the June Century, from which we have already quoted, Bishop Dudley, of Kentucky, says that the separation of the negro race from the white means for the negro continued and increasing degradation and decay. The experiment of Liberia, therefore, can hardly be regarded as offering any solution of the negro question in the South. Nevertheless, the fact that a Christian and, at least, as to institutions and habits, a civilized negro state, whose independence is recognized by all the great nations of the world, exists in western and tropical Africa, is not without significance and surely contains some seeds of hope. There is a large amount of American silver currency in circulation in Western Ontario, where it is taken freely at its face value. The Chatham Planet, having in memory the inconvenience and expense the country was put to to get rid of the same nuisance some fifteen years ago, warns the people not to encourage the use of these inferior coins, else some day they will find themselves with a lot of it on their hands, which they will have to submit to heavy discount to get rid of. Chatham merchants have taken steps in the matter already, and will likely continue to require discount on all they receive. The Paris correspondent of the London Times, writing of the prevailing conditions of trade in France, adduces the recent railway returns as affording striking proof of it. To the 22nd of last month, the receipts of the Northern railway show a decrease of 4,131,000 francs, or about 28 percent, on last year's return, which itself showed a decrease as compared with the figures for previous years. The Lyon railway has to meet a decrease of 1,440,000 francs, or nearly 9 percent; the Southern one of 2,140,000 francs, or 1 percent; the Eastern one of 5,131,000 francs, or 6 percent; the Orleans one of 1,000,000 francs, or 2 percent; still the Guiana one of 1,000,000 francs, or 1 percent. A considerable sum, it is likely, will have to be paid by the shareholders at the end of the year to make up the guaranteed dividends. It is not easy to see what spirit other than that of pure ""caution"" could have animated the people of the municipalities to the north of the city in their opposition to the establishment of the Mount Royal hospital. It could not have been fear of infection; the buildings are so situated that there is no danger to the inhabitants of even the nearest houses, and, judging by the statistics furnished to the authorities, the epidemic is much more virulent within their bounds than in the city proper. The true interests of these municipalities are much more liable to suffer from the acts of their own representatives, when they permit themselves to be thus led astray, than from anything Montreal will do, and the bill of costs they will be saddled on to pay in connection with these legal proceedings may have the effect of impressing this on the mind of the ratepayer. In pointing out the risks that arise from the maritime traffic in animals, Prof. Kream, in his paper read before the British Association on ""The Agricultural Situation,"" pays a high compliment to the system of perfection adopted in Canada. ""A method of livestock quarantine,"" he says, ""approaching in its stringency and perfection the admirable system which the Canadians have established at Quebec, is imperatively necessary before our breeders and stock farmers can feel in any degree safe from the disastrous outbreaks among their flocks and herds of the contagious diseases which have in recent years deprived our farmers of so much of their wealth. The maritime traffic in living animals is quite different in its character and its risks from the trade in any other kind of produce, whether agricultural, mineral or manufactured; it demands special precautions and no irrelevant issue as to free trade versus protection should be allowed to stand in the way of establishing such precautions."" In his account of a visit which he paid to Greece last year, Prof. Mahaffy writes, ""Greece is a growing country, both in its youth and in its age. The rapid development of the nation is altering the face of the country, establishing new roads and better communications, improving knowledge among the people, and making many places accessible which were before beyond the reach of brief holiday visits. The insecurity which haunted the Turkish frontier has been pushed back to the north; new Alps and new monasteries are brought within the range of Greece. And this is nothing to what has been done in recovering the past. Every year there are new excavations made, new treasures found, new problems in archaeology raised, old ones solved; and so at every visit there is a whole mass of new matter for the student who feels he has not yet grasped what was already there. Athens is rapidly becoming a great and rich city."" Lieut. Weissmann, whom a telegram received last week represents as having defeated the cannibals and ferocious Amazons of the Congo, is one of the number of German explorers and savants to whom Stanley gives high praise in his latest work. In referring to Prince Bismarck's policy, he instances the ability which he displayed both in sanctioning enterprises of exploration and colonization in Africa, and in selecting fit persons to conduct them. ""German savants,"" he says, ""had explored territories unclaimed by any power; German merchants were honestly established at certain places on the West African coast; out of the most intelligent and enterprising of the sons of Germany twenty-four geographical societies had been formed, and a dozen colonial associations, besides African societies, were being constituted in Germany. Already Bastian, Gussfeldt, Peschuel, Loesche, Buchner, Von Mechow, Pogge and Weissmann had been equipped by a German-African society, and it was preparing to dispatch more."" Lieut. Weissmann and Dr. Pogge had sent in a most encouraging report regarding the portion of territory which formed the scene of their researches, which they described as densely peopled, some of the villages being miles in length, with clean commodious houses, shaded by oil palms and bananas, and surrounded by carefully divided fields, in which the men attended to the cultivation of the soil, while the women confined themselves to their household duties. The tribes to which the telegram relates are of a very different character from those almost civilized communities, so highly commended by the explorers. The Minister of the Interior has been having a somewhat unpleasant experience in his overland trip to Prince Albert. From a letter dated Yorkton, October 4th, it is learned that he left Crescent, about twenty miles from Yorkton, on the previous afternoon, and was getting on swimmingly when darkness set in. The prairie fires had made the whole country black, and the party lost the trail. Getting branches with which to make torches a couple of hours were spent in looking for it, and then the search was given up as unavailing. Unhitching the horses and spreading the buffalo robes, the party lay down to await daylight, supperless and weary. About 10 o'clock a snowstorm came on, a regular blizzard, which continued all night, and by daylight the prairie was covered with four or five inches of snow. It was a long mile then they were walling, and when daylight came the survey found them in a direct line about a mile from their destination, and some two or three miles distant by the road. It was found, however, that there was a most dangerous ford across the river to make, and looking at it as they passed the thought came that a more serious mishap than an all-night outing in a prairie blizzard might have occurred. Hon. Mr. White remained at Yorkton on October 4th and 5th, interviewing settlers in the locality. He has been compelled to abandon his purpose of visiting Prince Albert, owing to the lateness of the season and the difficulty of travelling, and cannot get to the north until next spring. He, therefore, proceeded to Qu'Appelle on Wednesday of last week, and expects to reach Regina tomorrow en route to the Rockies. The delay will not make any difference in the time of Mr. White's return, which will be about the middle of November."

"18851104","EEROHJC AND HUB-BREATH ESCAPES won or own road arrangements Kt JdmVs, NIIJ, October 21 A terrible calamity has befallen this colony, entailing a very heavy loss of life and destruction of property, inflicting great suffering on many hundreds of our population. No disaster so serious has occurred since the destruction of St. John's by fire in 1840; but that involved only the destruction of property. In this case seventy-five lives are known to have been lost, and when all is known, it is probable many more will have to be added to the death list. I send you a brief telegraphic summary of the sad news received from Labrador on Saturday night to the effect that in a terrible storm which swept that country on the 11th and 12th instant eighty vessels had been wrecked, seventy-five lost, and two thousand persons driven ashore on that inhospitable coast, where most of them were without shelter and but a scanty supply of food. The news was first brought by the steamship Panther to St. John's, where she arrived from Turtivak, Labrador, on the 24th instant, late in the evening. The next day the barquentine Nellie arrived at St. John's, from Nuukey, with ten shipwrecked men, women and children. The intelligence brought by these two vessels showed the fearful extent of the havoc wrought by the storm. It appears that the gale commenced on Sunday morning, the 11th of October, and continued to rage with increasing fury till Monday evening at sunset, when it began to abate. Those who passed through it describe it as the most awful hurricane ever witnessed even by the hardy fishermen who frequent that storm-beaten coast. It first blew from the southeast, continually increasing in violence; then it suddenly veered to the northeast and the cold became intense. The fierce blasts began to hurl the snowflakes on their wings of gloom, and at intervals the whole atmosphere was darkened by the drifts. It was a scene of awe and terror, which the imagination can but faintly realize. The sea rose in tumultuous billows mountain high, the watery battalions hurled themselves fiercely against the dark cliffs and when flung back gathered their strength for fresh assaults. In the midst of this war of elements a fleet of little fishing vessels were struggling for life; some were caught in the tempest on their homeward voyage, laden deeply with the produce of the summer's tons; others lay at anchor, loading, in the exposed roadsteads and harbors, where there was no sufficient shelter. On board were hundreds of fishermen, many of them with their wives and children, for it is their custom to take their families with them to aid in handling the fish. As the storm continued and increased in violence the vessels were pressed near to this fatal rock where the white breakers were visible. Others were torn from their anchors and began to drift shoreward. One by one they approached their doom. In imagination we picture to ourselves the plunging vessels, their decks and holds crowded with terror-stricken, white-faced men and women; we hear the crash of the vessel as she strikes, the wild shrieks of despair, the human mass hurled into the seething surges, some sinking to rise no more, others clinging to fragments of the wreck; some flung ashore, more dead than alive, on the huge rollers. Fancy the awful condition of the survivors, flung out here dripping with brine, a blinding snowstorm raging around them, perhaps no human habitation or shelter near. They pass the dreary night shivering and wretched. When the storm abates and the sun shines out new terrors await them. The strand is strewn with the drowned corpses of their comrades, friends or relatives cast up by the pitiless sea; and on that dreary shore they must scoop out a shallow grave in which to commit earth to earth. As the sad task is begun, women are weeping and wringing their hands over the loss of husbands or sons, and heartbroken parents are taking the last look at the lifeless forms of children committed to this lonely grave without shroud or coffin. This is no imaginary picture. It was, alas! sadly realized in many an instance, in this terrible tempest, in which from 70 to 80 souls perished, and over 80 vessels were flung on the rocks. The sorrows of the shipwrecked crews were terrible; while some were driven ashore where there were huts to shelter them, others were wrecked on desolate islands, where they had to await relief, with scarcely enough to sustain life, and some found themselves miles away from any human habitation. The saddest scene of all was at White Bear Islands. Here two vessels, the Release and Hope, with all their anchors out, were struggling to ride out the storm. They held on till Monday morning, when the moorings gave way. The Release drifted on an island to leeward, and was speedily dashed to pieces. Twenty-five of those on board were drowned, all but six being women and children. The Hope was carried on a ledge of rock, near the shore. Two punts were launched and filled with those on board, who reached the shore in safety; but, before the remainder could be rescued, the vessel broke up, and fourteen met a watery grave, most of them being women and children. The scene is said to have been appalling. Poor mothers were seen clasping their children to their bosoms in speechless agony, and children crying for aid and clinging to the hands that were powerless to save. The merciless billows rushed on them and covered all with a winding sheet of foam. Thirty-nine in all perished at this single spot. One man lost his wife and four children. At Black Islands, a schooner belonging to Conception Bay was lost with all hands. At Ragged Islands, a man named Alfred King lost his wife and two children. A girl named Thistle, who was brought here in the Nellie, had a narrow escape. The vessel which she was on struck and went to pieces; she was hurled into the waves and washed ashore, fearfully bruised, one of her fingers having been taken off and one of her legs badly cut. She was carefully attended to on board the Nellie, and is now in a fair way of recovery. The kindness of the poor creatures to one another, when any have been specially unfortunate, is most touching."

STORY OF THE KI, SASTW!, as related by Captain Moore, is that the Algoma passed through Sault St. Marie canal bound for this port last Friday noon. Soon after reaching Lake Superior the wind began to freshen up from the southwest, and a great bank of leaden clouds along the northern horizon denoted the approach of heavy weather. However, the Algoma was one of the strongest and most powerful steamers afloat and well able to contend with even a severe gale, Captain Moore kept her on her course, but as midnight approached the wind continued to increase in violence, and the sea began to rise, and before midnight Lake Superior was lashed into a mass of heaving water. The storm swept completely over the struggling steamer, with waves weighing from ten to thirty pounds, making it more terrible by a blinding snowstorm that set in during the morning. It was impossible to see the length of the steamer. PASSENGERS AND CREW WERE TERRIFIED beyond measure and momentarily expected to see the steamer plunge to the bottom. By the instructions of Captain Moore, the officers went among the passengers and tried to allay their fears; however, they were panic-stricken and huddled together in the cabin, where the screams and prayers of women and children could be heard above the thundering of the gale. On Saturday morning the Algoma was struck, and Captain Moore headed the steamer for Rock Harbor, where he hoped to gain shelter; the island forms a natural harbor of refuge, but near the entrance, there is a dangerous reef, and just as the steamer was nearing the entrance she struck the reef. THERE WAS A TERRIBLE SHOCK, and the steamer came to a full stop. The passengers rushed out of the cabin and besought the officers to tell them what had happened. ""We are on a reef,"" replied Captain Moore, ""but if you will only keep as calm as possible I trust all will be safely landed."" Just then one of the crew reported that the steamer's bottom had been punctured and she was filling with water. The boats were at once got in readiness and all started to leave the steamer, but just as they were about to lower them the steamer slipped off the reef and disappeared with an angry roar. The water was covered with the struggling forms of men and women, and then all was over. THE VESSEL WILL BE A TOTAL WRECK. The weather since she went ashore has been a succession of heavy northeast gales and blinding snowstorms. If no provisions have been saved from the vessel there will undoubtedly be great privations experienced by the passengers and crew, owing to the fact that the supplies at Fox Bay would have been drawn upon by the crew of the NS Titantia, which went ashore near there on the 4th instant. The Algoma has a crew of about seventy and had about forty passengers, of which only three were saloon. The amount of her insurance cannot be ascertained, but it has been given to understand that Lloyds are interested. She had a cargo for Quebec, Montreal, and the west."

Life, the North Shore name: Hon. Henry Starnes and Mr. Archambault, amltault before the Commissioners. Quebec, December 5. Hon. Henry Starnes, of Montreal, and Hon. Mr. Archambault, member of Legislative Council, were examined yesterday before the Royal Commission on the sale of the North Shore railway. Hon. Mr. Starnes deposed that he had voted for the sale of the railway because he believed that its affairs could not be administered economically under Government control. He did not know of any undue influence having been employed with members of the Legislature to induce them to vote for the sale of the road, but from what he since knew of its earnings he believed that the Government obtained a full price for it, and this sale was in the interests of the province. Questioned on the nut lock question, Mr. Starnes said he had been informed by those in whose judgment he had been led to place confidence that these nut locks were a valuable invention for the connection of rails, and that large contracts had been entered into for them by American railways at prices in excess of what his department paid. He denied, however, that he had any knowledge of any portion of the profits derived from such transactions being applied for electoral purposes. The Rice Record, Narrow Escape of Two Families in Iw don, Ont. A blaze near Thorndale, London, Ont., December 4. Between 1 and 2 o'clock on Friday morning, the barns, stables, and outbuildings of the widow Stoddard's farm, in the township of West Missouri, about two miles from Thorndale, were consumed by fire, together with the season's crop. Sixteen head of cattle and a couple of horses, the property of Mr. Adam Turnbull, the lessee of the premises, were burnt. The fire was evidently the work of an incendiary, as no fire had been used about the barns or stables for many hours previous. A fire occurred last night in the double two-storey frame house on the south side of Beech Street, Kensington, owned by Mr. John W. Stockwell, of Toronto. The house was totally destroyed, together with most of the effects of the two tenants. Mr. Bedding, one of the tenants, and his son, had a very narrow escape from being burned to death. The son awakened about 2:30 and found himself surrounded by fire and smoke. Hastily awakening his father, he dashed out of the burning building without a stitch of clothing on him but his shirt, and was badly but not seriously burned. The father fared much worse. In escaping he was badly scorched, and to make matters worse the little clothing he had on caught fire. Delirious with pain, and knowing little what he was doing, he dashed through the blinding snowstorm down to the river and plunged into the cold water. The sudden transformation from the pain and heat of the burning to the frigid temperature of the stream had the effect of dissipating whatever remnant of recollection and self-control he had. Upon striking the current he floated downwards in an utterly helpless condition until his head came in contact with a quantity of ice, some hard portions of which cut him severely. The shock of this aroused him from the state of partial insensibility into which he had lapsed, and he at once started to swim across the river. Finally, he managed to reach the opposite bank, emerged from the water, and proceeded to the residence of Mr. Geo. Walker, where he was taken care of. A man named Mr. Loch occupied one portion of the building with his family of five children, and they managed to escape from the house in their night clothes but lost everything they possessed. They were supplied with clothing by residents of the village, who also donated bed clothes and other articles to them, and today a subscription is being taken up for the benefit of the sufferers."

The CP is getting plenty of business to do, and Mr. Gntj, the general superintendent up there, told me when I came away on Monday last that he was quite well satisfied with the amount of freight they were getting. The line is certainly one of which the country has every reason to be proud. We left Winnipeg at eight o'clock on Monday night, and notwithstanding a heavy snowstorm which delayed us for some time, we arrived in Montreal only ten minutes behind time. The accommodation along the line for passengers is unsurpassed. The dining car system is perfect and reflects the highest credit on the manager of that department, Mr. Swett. The wheat is coming into Brandon and other places around there in such quantities that they have not sufficient elevators to accommodate it, as many as 200 wagon loads coming into Brandon in one day. And now they are also manufacturing their own cheese and butter, and numerous other articles which they formerly had to import, and I should not wonder if in a very short time they will be exporting these articles. They have the very finest grass, and all they want to make it one of the best butter and cheese-producing countries is the proper facilities, which are now being supplied. They also have poultry in abundance now, and everything points to the fact that the Northwest will be a great country in the future. Lieut.-Col. Whitehead also returned to the city yesterday."

KILLED ON THE TRACK An Aged French-Canadian Meets His Death Near Lachute. A fatal accident occurred on the Canadian Pacific railway at Lachute on Saturday night, resulting in the death of a middle-aged man named Auclair. The deceased, who resided in the village, started for his home shortly after seven o'clock with the intention of visiting the station. The unfortunate man proceeded along the track and had accomplished about half of the distance when the Toronto express thundered along, striking him with terrible force and hurling him into the ditch. The engineer immediately brought the train to a standstill, and hastening to the spot discovered Auclair in an apparently dying condition. The unfortunate victim was removed to a hotel, where he died half an hour later. An inquest will be held. The engineer of the train will likely be exonerated from all blame as he blew the whistle to warn the pedestrian of his danger. Observing that the frequent warnings were unheeded, the brakes were applied, but, unfortunately, too late to prevent the accident. A blinding snowstorm was raging at the time, preventing the driver from observing objects more than a hundred yards distant. It is stated that Auclair suffered from deafness.

MONTREAL'S RECORD, observations taken at McGill College on OBSERVATORY JANUARY 9, m t? m Wind, Time 3 8 S Weather, A. Leveque, Km: Dear Sir, I received and have read yours of November 20. I will answer the questions you ask, but I don't wish to be drawn into a controversy, or to take any part in an enquête which, so far as I can see, would have the effect, at this late hour, of producing no better result than ill-feeling between individuals, or give rise to personal quarrels. Having expressed myself on this point, I will answer your inquiries as fully as possible, following the theory you yourself have marked. I am the person who, on the 28th of February last, asked to be admitted to the Montreal General Hospital, and later on in the same evening to the Hotel Dieu. I was not suffering from anything and my disease was recognized by Dr. Rodger, who received and examined me on my arrival from Chicago at 9 p.m. on the above-mentioned date. To say where, or under what circumstances I contracted the disease would be difficult. I have every reason to believe, however, that I took it at Chicago, III. About February 11, I was in that city by a snowstorm from February 14 to February 18, which would have given the disease eight days to develop. The disease showed itself on my face and body under the form of eruption, or rash, the Thursday before admission to the Hotel (Thursday, the 28th of February), during the journey from Chicago to Montreal. On Friday after my admission in the Hotel Dieu, during the morning, an attendant brought a register on which was inscribed my name, my present residence, my age, my religion, etc. I said I wished to be attended by Dr. Rodger. The nurse answered, ""No, Dr. Rodger does not attend the patients in this institution."" I asked that Dr. Singleton's name be inscribed as my attending physician, and this was done. The same day (Sunday) Dr. Rodger told me it would be impossible for him to attend me, but he promised to come and see me from time to time. This he did, and during my stay in the hospital came to see me three or four times. Dr. Hiltga visited me every two or three days during the whole of my illness; the physician attached to the institution did the same, but I have forgotten the name of the latter. Such are the answers I can give to the questions you have asked me. I am, dear sir, very respectfully yours, GIo"

The corpse was found with the eyes bandaged and the skull smashed in. The body lay between the rails on a bridge on the Western railway. It is evident that the murderers intended to throw it into the Seine. His pocketbook, loose money and watch were gone. It is now known that M. Barreme had a large sum of money in his possession. It is supposed the murderers were disturbed in the operation of rifling the clothes of the dead man, as they overlooked a pocket containing 500 francs. Experienced detectives have been detailed to work up the case, but so far no clue has been found, except that just prior to the starting of the train a gentleman enquired of the guard whether Barreme was aboard. On being answered in the affirmative, he purchased a ticket and boarded the same train. Barreme was the father of a large family.

RESULT OF POLICE ENQUIRIES. The incendiary elements are well equipped for the Great Revolution. Chicago, January 14. Investigations made by the city police, private detectives and other persons commissioned to work have disclosed that the Anarchists of this city have been engaged assiduously in manufacturing dynamite bombs and in experimenting with other infernal machines for purposes, as they declare, of destroying the militia and blowing up large public buildings when the ""great revolution"" begins. At the time an infernal machine was found on Judge Tree's premises about three weeks ago, there was an immediate suggestion that it had been placed there by Socialists and might be the opening move of a dynamite war against wealthy property owners. When publicity was given to the fact that a somewhat similar explosive had been left in the building occupied by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy general offices, some people asserted it to be the second gun of the dynamite attack. Believing that these occurrences were sporadic and not symptoms of an organized movement by Socialists or any body of incendiary destructionists, an investigation was instituted into the character of the two suspicious machines and as to the present doings of Chicago Socialists. It was claimed that the Socialists and trades unions had joined hands to carry by force the strike for eight hours as a day’s work on May 1st. The week before last, the metal workers voted funds to arm themselves, and a week ago on Tuesday the cabinet makers set aside one-half of their entire surplus for the purchase of Winchester rifles. The Socialists boast that they have over 9,000 bombs loaded and distributed in the hands of trusty persons. The investigator was only able to catch sight, however, of a few of these. The Socialist brotherhood has the advantage of possessing an organ printed in the German language which, week after week, disseminates incendiary ideas, while from its job press go circulars, maps, etc., showing streets, sewers and tunnels of the city and giving instructions in street warfare and the practical use of explosives. The social leaders claim that they have established depots for the storing of various bombs and that they have lists of prominent persons to be disposed of by dynamite. They further claim that every Sunday morning, for a year, bands of Socialists have been going to the country to practice the throwing of bombs, and that tests of their effectiveness and the manner of explosion have been frequently made. One thing the investigation went far to prove was the improbability that the Socialists had anything to do with placing the infernal machines at Judge Tree's house or in the offices of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway company. The dissimilarity of these from each other, as well as from the dynamite bomb manufactured for the Socialists, is very marked. The package left at Judge Tree's house was in the shape of a laborer's coffee flask and was lined with lead. The diameter was about two inches, and the height 3 inches. From the top, closed by a thumb screw, protruded a homemade fuse, which smelled strongly of nitric acid. It was of good workmanship and had none of the appearance of a commercial article, being highly polished, like a pocket flask, and carefully finished. The package at the C."

A heavy snowstorm prevailing over the winter wheat sections quiets the fear for the present regarding the crop. The bears improved the opportunity and raided the market, resulting in a general stampede to sell by local and outside holders. About the same time the weak feeling was increased by a vague rumor that $1,000,000 in gold had been taken for shipment, but the decline was largely due to natural heaviness of the legitimate situation, there being no export demand.

fireman of the freight jumped and saved themselves James McElroy, fireman of the leading shunting engine, who was shoveling in coals at the time and did not observe the approach of the freight train, was thrown twenty feet in the air and fell in a snowbank He got up to walk away, but discovered that one of his feet was missing, which was found on the top of his cab John Hushing, driver of the leading shunting engine, found himself under the platform at the exhibition grounds, uninjured The engine of the freight train has trucks driven under the boiler, and the pilot smashed into firewood The leading shunting engine, on being struck, reared up against the other, and the cab was thrown on top of the other engine The freight train was loaded with general merchandise, and a large quantity of goods were destroyed and coal oil barrels burst The cars are all more or less damaged McElroy was carried to a house nearby, where everything possible was done for him He was afterwards taken to the hospital where his leg was amputated The wreck will likely be all removed by daybreak The loss will be very considerable The men on the freight train declare that the signal was not up, while the

York Post of this afternoon says Stocks were all lower today The extreme declines were mainly about 1 30, ranging from 1 to 1 8 on the active stocks, and from which there was but little recovery The causes for the decline were chiefly in the dealings of the local clique, and speculators, rather than in the general aspects of the situation, though the latter are not favorable to higher prices just now The heavy snowstorm at the West reported this morning will obstruct all business and be an expense to the railroad, and this, together with the comparatively insignificant amount of $300,000 gold export this week, has given the bears an opportunity of which they have taken advantage, and may even drive prices temporarily lower next week The market has become narrower than a few weeks ago, and local manipulation has more effect upon price The sales today were 820,100 shares, against 249,000 yesterday The total sales for the week were 2,274,700 shares, against 2,210,800 last week and

from New York, which has further reduced the stock The fact is that the stock is now in compact form and not likely to cause any anxiety, except to the bear organ, who probably wonders where the 200,030 boxes have gone to Indeed so far as the stock question is concerned the whole situation has a healthy look The bear statement of the visible supply on January 1 is not being borne out, neither is there much likelihood that there will be too much cheese, unless the demand on the other side shuts off entirely In New York there has been a perceptible improvement, and a line of 3,000 boxes of white was taken on Thursday at about 9 1/2c, which fact speaks well for the market and compares very favorably with the condition of affairs last year The exports from New York this week were over 18,000 boxes The official statement of the exports of cheese from the United States during the month of December shows a total of 3,409,696 pounds against 6,094,060 pounds for the same month in 1884-a decrease of 1,684,454 pounds or 33,600 boxes The exports from the United States from May 1 to December 31 were 74,886,756 pounds valued at $6,174,487, against 96,913,096 pounds valued at $9,612,746

made the line of valuation is quite as full as formerly noted, and the claims for strength made by holders are endorsed by shippers who have actually handled stock Perfection of white cheese cannot be reached for less than 10c, and 10 1/2c is inside for corresponding quality of colored, with an intimation that some of the latter has been taken for export Demand for night skims is very good, and low

"18860205","MCW YOHK IN MISKKV, New York, February 4, 1886 The snowstorm which prevailed yesterday continued all night. It is a regular western blizzard, and undoubtedly the worst storm New York has experienced since 1882. The streets are filled with snow and the streetcars are pulled along with great difficulty by double teams. What adds to the difficulties of the situation is the strike upon the Broadway and Seventh Avenue railroads, the Broadway surface railroad, the Sixth Avenue railroad, and the Fourth Avenue railroad. Many business men have been compelled to walk down to their offices. All mails are delayed. THE WEATHER FOR THIRTY YEARS Baltimore, Md, February 4 The snow in seventeen inches deep here, the fall being the heaviest since Washington, February 4. The railroads to the southward have suffered great interruption from the snowstorm. No trains were sent out from Richmond northward yesterday afternoon and last night. LYNCHBURG, Va, February 1 Snow falling since Wednesday is twelve inches deep. All railroad communication is interrupted. Reports from the southwest portion of the state indicate an unparalleled snowstorm, and here the snow is from two to three feet deep. GALE IN THE EAST Provincetown, Mass, February 4 A severe northeast snowstorm set in last night and continues with unabated fury. When darkness came on there were ten schooners off Highland Light. Part of them succeeded in making this port. The British schooner Laura Brown, from New York for St. John, N.B, February 4 Newport is experiencing the heaviest snowstorm known for several years. Since yesterday afternoon, from ten to twelve inches has fallen, and has drifted badly. The thermometer fell to within a few degrees of zero today."
"18860208","VTREAL CARNIVAL MISSED People hereabouts miss very much the Montreal winter carnival. It had got to be one of the attractive events of the season. Many went to it and had a jolly good time, and brought back the story of what they enjoyed and gained from it. Many more regretted that they had not gone too, and vowed that the next year they would not fail to have a share in the pleasure of so novel and enjoyable a trip. It occupied, too, considerable space in the newspapers, and was a grateful relief from the accounts of murders, suicides, defalcations and crimes which, spiced to suit depraved tastes, come from all parts of this world, and, for aught I know, from one part of the other, to be dished up by the daily papers and served as an appetiser at our breakfast tables. Next year, if all goes well, you must make an unusual effort and have a week of sports and a display that will eclipse what you have previously accomplished and make the world forget the dark episode of last autumn and think of Montreal only as the gay, hospitable, prosperous, health-giving place summer tourists, and especially your carnival visitors, have in times past always found it. THE NUMBER OF IMPOSING STRUCTURES which have been put up downtown during the past few years is immense. Many of the banks have invested a part of their superfluous money in that way, and the buildings erected by some of the large life insurance companies are among the most expensive in the city. It is doubtful whether the majority pay more than three or four percent on the investment, and there is always danger of loss from bad tenants and more or less wear and tear to cut down even the returns. But they add to the appearance of the business streets, are very convenient and often serve as good advertisements for the companies that build them. The Equitable Insurance company's building, although among the oldest of them, is quite a model. It has a door leading directly from it into Delmonico's restaurant, a special post office for the receipt and delivery of tenants' letters, telegraph and newspaper counters, soda water fountain and a barber's shop in the basement, and to make its offices attractive to lawyers, who compose the majority of its tenants, it has a very good and constantly improving and increasing law library, to which all tenants have free access. The relations between THE PRESIDENT AND THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY in the Senate are becoming somewhat strained owing to the claim of the latter to get from the various cabinet officers the reasons for the removals and suspensions which have been made. There is something more in the position and demands of the Senate than appears at first sight. Looking at it superficially there seems no reason why Cleveland should be treated differently from the presidents that have gone before him, in respect to removals and appointments, although in exceptional cases such demands as the present have heretofore been made. But when one examines into the matter more closely a state of facts is found to exist which puts Mr. Cleveland in a totally different position from his predecessors and goes to justify the Senate in the course they are taking. President Cleveland after his election and before he entered upon his duties, did what no other president did, he made a public declaration in uniformed letter to the Civil Service Commission of his intention in regard to those whom he should find in office. He explicitly announced that no official who had attended and was attending to his duties and had not been an offensive partisan need fear removal. And later on one of his cabinet officials sent about a printed circular over his own name, stating ""provisional"" to even minor officials, indicating the claims of those seeking office under him, indicating the alleged partisanship or the inefficiency or incompetency of incumbents. It is, of course, to be presumed, even in the case of minor violations of the rules laid down by him, that he has, in general, confirmed it in making changes. But many officials have been removed in the middle of their terms and had the reputation of being efficient and upright, who were not in any such partisanship, and the only possible inference, supposing the President to be acting upon the line of conduct which he had himself announced, is that these men have been suspended because of some allegation against them personally, or because of some alleged dereliction in the manner of conducting their duties, of which the public does not hear, and they go out of office with a stigma attached to them and with no way of clearing themselves from it, or of finding out what, if any, the charges against them are, except through the interposition of the Senate. And, besides this wish to protect reputable men who have been treated in this way and are suffering under the imputation I have partly described, the Senate are unquestionably actuated by political motives. They desire to hold the President up to the promises he made before election, and the course he declined his intention of pursuing after election, show up to the people his failure to do so, and make whatever political capital they can out of this. Meantime, no one suffers very seriously except the new officials, whose continuations are essential to the comfortable and assured occupancy of their position, and who, therefore, await with much uneasiness the slow progress of the controversy. APROPOS OF THE AMERICAN PHENOMENON among a certain set known as swells New Yorkers, the story is told of one of this class who particularly affected the English style and plumed himself not a little on always being dressed en rigueur and conforming most strictly to the latest fashionable fashion, that he astonished his friends by appearing on Fifth Avenue on a particularly warm bright sunny afternoon with dreadnought and an umbrella opened over his head. To some of them who remonstrated with him on such apparently insane conduct, he replied in great surprise, ""Why, my dear fellow, that's all right you know. I have just had a cable from the other side telling me that the rain is pouring down in torrents in London, and all the fellows are in their storm clothes you know."" EVEN NEW YORK'S UNUSUAL SEMI-ABLE CLIMATE has quite outdone itself the past fortnight. There have not been more than five days in all the fourteen in which the sun has shone, and most of these were only partially clear overhead and abominable underfoot. Yesterday and today, however, have been worthy of Montreal. The thermometer has been down near zero and an old-fashioned snowstorm has covered the ground a number of inches deep with a white covering. The employees on some of the surface car lines have taken this opportunity to carry out the threats which have been made off and on for a long time of striking. No cars are running on the Sixth Avenue, Broadway and Fourth Avenue lines, and these streets seem quite deserted. Of course this strike causes a good deal of annoyance and inconvenience, but not nearly so much as the stoppage of the elevated roads would. As it is long-distance passengers take the elevated cars, while those going a short distance walk. To the public there seems to be considerable reason in the demand which the surface road employees make that their working hours, which are now thirteen to fourteen, shall be shortened to twelve. Twelve hours a day are long enough for any man to work too long for most men. The gate and ticket men on the elevated roads work twelve hours continuously and are not allowed any time at noon. THE PLACES OF AMUSEMENT are full every night, and pretty much everything seems to draw, notwithstanding the bad weather and dull times. The American Opera Company, quite unexpectedly to those who have worked long and laboriously in its behalf, and who did not hope for pecuniary success this season at least, has not only paid expenses but shown a substantial profit. The German opera is equally well, if not better, patronized, and the experiences of this winter show that there are enough lovers, or those who like to be considered patrons, of good music in New York to support two opera companies, if they are so composed and arranged as to be worthy of support. Italian opera has been such a failure of late and so much money has been sunk in it that it seemed at one time likely that the two great houses, the Academy and the Metropolitan, would be closed except for concerts and occasional entertainments. The ""Mikado"" excites unabated interest. Parke, the downtown dealer in Japanese goods, told me that the success of the ""Mikado"" had marvelously stimulated the demand for all kinds of wares manufactured by the Japanese. He said he was selling four times as much china plaque work as he ever did before, and is making up a great many expensive Japanese costumes for the traveling ""Mikado"" companies and for use at private entertainments."
"18860209","C. Peasley, representing the Stanstead lodge, did a daring thing. On his way he encountered a severe snowstorm which, in the French settlements, completely blocked the road. He was obliged to leave his sleigh and tread through drifts for miles with the use of only one arm leading his horse and carrying a valise which contained the charter and jewels of Golden Rule. On arriving near the St. Lawrence he learned there was no ferry. He dauntlessly pushed forward to Caughnawaga, crossed the river in a small boat amid fields of ice, even at the hazard of his life, and arrived in Montreal in season to attend the meeting. In 1828-9 the Stanstead lodge died out from a variety of causes. But in November, 1846, a number of gentlemen who had been detained by an unusually severe snowstorm while attending the winter show of the Agricultural Society of Stanstead County, met by accident at West's Tavern, Derby Line. P. Caron are as fortunate in their artist and he is happy in their portrayal. Before leaving the oils some mention should be made of Mr. Forbes' Rocky Mountain landscapes (201), (202), (203), shown with some other pictures not eligible for this exhibition, but collected for the purpose of selecting examples of Canadian art for the Colonial and Indian exhibition at London. They will give some idea of the wealth of material for landscape to be found in British Columbia, an almost untrodden field, though by the way the subject of one of them, ""The Mount of the Holy Cross,"" is in Colorado. Having illustrated this fur, we may as well say of ""The Illustrator, Montreal, 1880"" that it is wonderful how a lady who has painted in a good thing in England, and is as versatile in talent as in Miss M. H. Brinck, can be guilty of such absurdity as this whim she conveys to Canada. THE WATER COLUMN are almost entirely landscape painting, Mr. Sandham is the only one who comes to the fore with figures, repetition of his well-known and admirably executed tobogganing scenes, well drawn and full of motion and color as usual, and excellently illustrative of the Carnival view of our winter, which, however, might be allowed to sink into less prominence for a little while with no great loss. The long straight lines of the slide are not pleasant to the eye, and we are getting tired of foreshortened young men and maidens coming at express train speed right out of the frame at us. That familiar sleigh in a ""Snowstorm"" and the leathern tires on the roadside are more picturesque, but let us have no hint of summer. Mr. Sandham, please don't carry aggravation to the utmost by pretty conceits of white frames. Mr. Uvull's ""Summer Snowballs"" (45) are more to our taste, a simple bunch of white blooms, soft and pleasant to see. ""Sunset over the Glen"" (16) is the smallest but most pleasing of Mr. Uvull's three exhibits, a warm effect of gold through the russets and browns of a tree-shaded ravine. His ""Sonny Lake"" (71) is thin and artificial."

"18860227","THE ACCIDENT REPORTED yesterday morning a man whose name could not be ascertained was admitted to the General Hospital, suffering from a severe cut over the left eye, apparently inflicted with a sharp instrument. His wound was dressed and he was discharged. A young man named Leblanc, aged 21 years, while working in Messrs. James Whitburn & Co.'s boot and shoe factory, had his right hand crushed in a machine. He was attended to at the General Hospital. Yesterday morning Mrs. Patrick McCoy was struck by a sleigh at the corner of Gabriel and Notre Dame streets, and sustained severe internal injuries. She was attended to at her residence, No. 14 Aylmer Street, where she now lies in a precarious condition. The owner of the sleigh is said to be a milkman from St. Laurent named Joseph Grotlix. Yesterday, while Mrs. Nadon, residing on St. Vincent Street, was leaning over the shoulder of a young lady while the latter was cutting meat with a knife, the young girl raised the knife and accidentally cut Mrs. Nadon's wrist so severely that she had to be removed to the Notre Dame Hospital for treatment. While Jean Lemire, aged 18, carter, residing at No. 257 Visitation Street, was driving after a runaway horse on Thursday evening, he fell forward onto the street and his brother falling upon him fractured the former's thigh. He was taken to the Notre Dame Hospital. Mr. Phillip Edwin, brother-in-law of Constable Napoleon Langlois, of Montreal, was killed on the Central Vermont track near St. Albans a few days ago. It appears that he had left his home about 10 o'clock and taking to the track was knocked down and almost instantly killed by an engine. The engineer stated that on account of the heavy snowstorm they could see nothing ten feet ahead of them, and that deceased, who was heading for the depot, did not expect another train along, consequently he was unaware of the approach of the engine. The body was found by the mayor of the village, and was immediately recognized. The skull was cut open and a leg broken, but no other injuries were visible. Deceased was a middle-aged man and a traveller. He had left a considerable sum of money to his mother."

ELLKROFIIOL OVERDUE London, March 1 (Queen Victoria spares timeously paid a great compliment to America today in receiving Mrs. Phelps, the wife of the United States minister, in a private audience at Windsor Castle. Mrs. Phelps was accompanied by the Earl and Countess Rosebery. The party was met at the Windsor station and conveyed to the castle by special court carriages. The Countess presented Mrs. Phelps in the audience room. The Queen received Mrs. Phelps most cordially and conversed with her for some time. The reception of a minister's wife privately by the Queen is almost phenomenal. That honor is due only to the wives of ambassadors. The honor is the notable indication that the Queen will hold a drawing room shortly at which it is customary to present ministers' wives to her. Mrs. Phelps was attired in mourning. The party lunched at the castle and was conveyed back to the station in the same royal carriages preceded by gorgeous postillions. Mr. Phelps did not accompany his wife. Official notice is given to the court circular of the presentation of Mrs. Phelps. A Balloon Accident Paris, March 1 At a fete yesterday in Perpignan forty thousand persons were present.

Bismarck's Health Berlin, March 1 Bismarck has recovered from his attack of sciatica. He will attend the annual political dinner on Tuesday. Presented to the Queen London, March 1 The commercial outlook is firm. While the London market continues to report firm in markets for wheat, the feeling there today was rather easier. Grains in all positions, however, were firm, while the English country markets were generally dearer, with the French doing steadily. At Markham wheat was the turn to be fair. Corn oil in passage was steady and in Liverpool rather easier. The deliveries of wheat by farmers during the week were 60,000 to 70,000 quarters. Paris advices were quiet. Reims reported heavy snowstorm prevalent. The wheat market in Chicago continued unsettled and weak. After merely evidences of something like firmness, it retreated and declined 5c, closing at 79c March, 84c May. Corn was easy, closing a shade lower at 30c March, 31c April, 40c May. Oats were inactive, closing at 28c March, 29c April, 30c May. Today, the action was 7 cars winter wheat, 49 spring, 456 corn, 139 oats, 4 rye and 62 barley. A private circular dated Saturday afternoon says: The larger class of operators doing nothing. There seems to be plenty of long wheat for sale all the time, and no good buying noticeable today. The impression prevails quite generally that next visible supply statement will show small decrease perhaps less than half a million. The reported large purchases recently at New York for export have not yet been hauled out, and the receipts at Minneapolis have been liberal all the week, and the milling demand seems to have been rather light all around. It was remarked today that May wheat has not in this market at any time this season, on a Saturday, closed under 85c during the life of the option. It has twice quite recently been demonstrated that the market has not sufficient inherent strength to resist vigorous selling; it also demonstrates a lack of confidence in the stuff by outside operators. The weather this week must have been very trying on the growing wheat, and if there was anything like ordinary confidence in the stuff, the market would have been bulled sharply on this alone; but there has been so much money lost the past two years in trying to bull wheat, that now that class of operators seem afraid to touch at any price. I think we have passed the time now when wheat can be bulled on sentiment alone. Operators are now searching for facts on the bull side, and find them very scarce. All predictions as to increased foreign and home consumptive demand, that was to melt away our large surplus, seem to have fizzled out as time progresses, and really, there is nothing that we can see warranting material advance in values, or even sustaining them at present level. Taking retrospect, here we are at the close of another month, and the load is as heavy as ever, and cannot see wherein the bulls have gained a single point worth naming. If we do not get crop scare pretty soon, I think the market will drag along as time passes, to lower prices than we have yet seen. Milmine, Hodman & Co., of Chicago, telegraph W. J. E. Girouard, notary, of Drummondville, will likely come forward in the interest of the Liberal party. He passed yesterday through Arthabaska to learn what chances he may have in that part of the constituency.

The German spirit monopoly bill was introduced in the Reichstag today by Dr. Scholz, Minister of Finance. In offering the measure, Dr. Scholz said the financial condition of the individual states of the empire generally justified the bill. The spirit duties imposed by France, England, Russia, and the United States, he said, yielded 2,000,000,000 marks yearly. The Government was ready to consider any amendments to the bill. He claimed that the spirit monopoly would prove the most objectionable form of taxation and appealed to the different parties in the house to display mutual forbearance and to harmoniously cooperate with the Government in its effort to pass the bill.

A deputation of Presbyterians today presented to the Earl of Aberdeen, the Lord Lieutenant, an address of welcome on behalf of the General Assembly. The address assures the Government of the unwavering loyalty of the Assembly and insists that the maintenance of the union in its fullest integrity is essential to the peace of Ireland. It declares that half a million of Irish Presbyterians will oppose to the utmost any attempt to sever the union. Lord Aberdeen replied briefly, saying he hoped that at no distant date an era of peace would be inaugurated in Ireland. The Congo Boundary, Paris, March 4. Negotiations for the Congo loan have been broken off.

"18860312","B, writes: A snowstorm began here on Thursday evening, the 25th of February, which is believed to be unprecedented in the history of our country. It continued almost incessantly for about four days, accompanied with very heavy wind. Nearly three feet of snow has fallen. Roads in nearly all sections of the country are completely blocked; in many places the drifts are from ten to fifteen feet high. The last week in January saw a fall of nearly four days to the depth of about eight inches. Very few, if any, here ever knew of so heavy a snowstorm. We have likewise had some of the coldest weather known for many years, while again the first part of the winter has been quite mild. The attempt to collect a note of $500 in Kentville the other day brought to light a rather dirty forgery. It is that George Hoy, who has been running an oyster and liquor store at the head of Hell's Lane in this city, for some time just from Charlie Farrow on a joint note drawn by himself and Charles Turner, Jr. Farrow allowed the note to run on for three years, thinking his money to be well invested. The note Farrow supposed to be signed by a Henry Turner, who is a well-to-do farmer in New Minas, but upon presenting the note for collection, Turner disclaimed all knowledge of its existence. Fallow seems to think a Lawrence, who recently failed in Kentville, took a gold chain and $2, which he had borrowed of him shortly before he left for the States. The Nova Scotia government last summer sent a commissioner to Digby to investigate the white slaves scandal. The allegation that the Digby poor were farmed out to parties who starved them to death, froze them to death and otherwise butchered them, is not sustained by the commissioner’s report. He finds, however, that in some cases paupers have suffered through neglect of the keeper to provide medical aid. The commissioner recommended that the indemnifying system which prevails in one or two sections should be discontinued. Under this system the overseers make a bargain with one man that he will for a lump sum provide for the lodging, clothing, feeding and medical attendance for all the poor who may become chargeable to the section for the year."

"18860324","MBS, HANCOCK GRANTED A PENSION The Mikado Times New York's line, a late right between cowboys and home thieves, (1111 Aim, March 21 A party of policemen visited a house on West Fourteenth Street this morning in search of Christ Kimes, the missing sister of Louis Friedman and Hermann Burrowsky. They did not find their man, but in a trunk in the home's bedroom they found a revolver, four round shells of lead, about three inches in diameter, a cartridge box, a piece of iron pipe with a projecting fuse at the end, and about six yards of rope. A little look beside the shells explained their use. On the outside, printed in italics, was the following inscription: ""DESTRUCTIONARY WAR KNOWLEDGE,"" a book containing the art of using and manufacturing dynamite, gun cotton, explosive mercury, and incendiary implements and poison. Published by the International Mining Verel No. 107 William Street, New York. The police beat a hasty retreat. When they concluded to go back and make a more thorough investigation, they found that the shells weighed about five pounds and that they were all lined with plaster of Paris. Only one of them was apparently loaded. In the tops were little holes just the size of each of about fifty caps found in the cartridge box. The piece of tube was closed at both ends, but a little piece of cotton stuck out of a crack. It is thought to be full of gun cotton. The fuse is inside but with a hard tarred exterior. The officers found in an adjoining room a Springfield rifle, a box of cartridges, and a pot for melting lead, of which there was a large quantity in the room. All the stuff was taken to police headquarters. Oolog, In 4 square, Washington, March 23 The bill granting a pension of $2,000 a year to the widow of Gen.

The same committee reported a bill to prevent the introduction of contagious and infectious diseases into the United States, and to establish a bureau of public health. The House committee on post offices conducting the telegraph investigation today began inquiry into the alleged attempts of the Western Union company to coerce newspapers in the Western States into making ""exclusive contracts,"" etc. Cowboys and Horse Thieves, Bismarck, Dak., March 23 A desperate struggle between cowboys and horse thieves is reported from the Upper Missouri River country. It is stated that a party of cowboys came upon a number of horse thieves in timber on the river bank, 100 miles north of Bismarck, and after the exchange of several shots the thieves attempted to escape. Charles Braddock and Jack O'Brien, two outlaws, were killed. Four thieves reached the river and rode out on the ice. Two horses broke through, and, with their riders, were swept away. The two other thieves returned to the bank, where the cowboys caught them, tied them on the backs of the ponies, and took them to parts unknown. They have probably been lynched. A New Weather Prophet, Syracuse, N.Y., March 23 The cold wave and blinding snowstorm, which visited this section today, was foretold by the Rev. Dr. Calthrop, of this city, nearly a month ago. His prediction was based upon observation of sun spots continued through eight years. Dr. Calthrop's prediction was in direct contradiction to the forecast sent out by the Government weather bureau. He was successful in foretelling the great storm of February 2nd, and thinks he is on the path of an unknown law of solar influence upon climate.

"18860420","M' do Montoucuve bore the cross himself, though it was of no light weight and though the road was rough. An altar was duly erected on the mountain and M' Duperron celebrated mass, Aladama de la Pautrie being the first to communicate. For long afterwards the cross was the destination of pious pilgrimages. So ended the first Montreal flood of which history has preserved the record. Again and again the destroyer reappeared, but it was not till comparatively recent times that the damage done was on a scale which gave the event the character of a great public disaster. Of these later inundations, still remembered by many of our citizens, that of 1848 was, at the time of its occurrence, considered without precedent for extent and the desolation that it caused. It began on the 14th of January and the waters kept rising till the 17th by which date the inhabitants of the lower portions of the city were in a condition of extreme distress. The streets in the path of the flood lay under water to a depth of from two to six feet, according to their nearness to the river. The greatest suffering was in the emigrant shed at Point St. Charles, where many persons lay sick. Gilliutown was flooded through nearly its whole extent and many of the inhabitants lost most of their household goods. In 1867 the same sad drama was repeated, the same quarter of the city being once more the principal victims. On both occasions the suffering was very great in proportion to the actual loss sustained, as most of those alluded to belonged to the poorer class of citizens. THE NEXT NOTEWORTHY FLOOD was that of 1861, which for many years was looked upon as the worst that the hostile waters had done or, perhaps, could do. It was then that the Rev. Canon Allegood's congregation was taken captive by aqueous ambuscade, the river having risen rapidly while divine service was going on, and the worshippers, on attempting to issue forth at its close, found themselves surrounded and imprisoned. A similar surprise befell the congregation of the Ottawa Street Wesleyan church. The whole of St. Paul street and McGill street, as far as St. Maurice street, was under water. The loss of livestock was great. Though, like the present visitation, the flood of 1861 came in the middle of April, the severe weather made it less tolerable for poor people, a violent snowstorm having set in before the water subsided. In 1865 Montreal was the scene of another inundation, only less extensive and less destructive than its immediate predecessor. The river began to rise on the 31st of March and continued rising till the 4th of April. On this occasion, however, the rise was gradual and the people, for the most part, had sufficient time to remove their effects to a place of security. The spring of 1869 was distinguished by a like unwelcome event aggravated in newspaper offices by a printers' strike. In 1873 another inundation took place, but, as well as its two predecessors, it was inferior in magnitude to that of 1861. When it was over, Montreal enjoyed so long an interval of exemption that people began to hope that the age of floods had passed away for good and all, and no precautionary measures were adopted against a return of the desolating foe. On the 24th of April, 1885, our citizens were wakened from their dream of security by certain appearances, which the observers of nature's movements regarded as ominous. Many, notwithstanding, remained incredulous, and on the 23rd of April matters looked promising enough. On the following day, however, a marked change took place, and those who had taken previous warnings in earnest were thankful that they had done so. The scenes that followed the sudden rising of the water this time twelve months will be fresh in the minds of our readers. The misery then endured by hundreds of persons will not soon pass from their memories. For four days the waters held high carnival. During that period of distress there was no lack of counsel. All kinds of schemes for the avoidance of similar calamities in future abounded in conversations on the streets and communications to the press. Some benevolent ladies and gentlemen contented themselves, meanwhile, with relieving the distress that was presented to their pitying eyes. But the waters of 1885 at last subsided and before the year closed other visitations, more frightful and more deadly, consigned the spring floods and the sorrows that came with them to oblivion. And so, when, in January of the present year, the encroaching waters were once more upon us, and the lower levels of the city were overwhelmed, we were as helpless as ever. Again there were measures for relief, again generous hands were extended to the poor sufferers. It was a terrible time to many, a time of discomfort and cold and hunger. But worse was still to come. The second flood of 1886 will long be remembered as surpassing all that went before it in its disastrous consequences. As yet it is impossible to estimate the extent of the damage which its ravages have caused. It is evident that if such heavy invasions were in store for us, we would be simply staring doom in the face. Even the possibility that any winter or spring may bring us a repetition of this year's experience can only be viewed as calamitous; it removes that confidence in trade which is the basis of all enterprise in business, and, in a business man as one is, where the riverside half of the city is the centre of so many interests, such confidence is an essential element to our success as a community. If it is possible, therefore, to avert such a calamity, no effort should be spared in doing so. Canada has engineers of whom she is justly proud. If they met in council, they might surely devise some plan by which the horrors of our present situation might be escaped in years to come. In other countries great national obstacles have been conquered. Holland was in great part won from the sea. In that country there is a board of dyke commissioners, men of knowledge, skill and experience, whose duty it is to superintend all the embankments. Why should not some similar body be called into existence in Canada? To restrain the encroachments of the river is certainly the work of specialists, and till it is entrusted to specialists, who are made responsible for securing the public against its devastations, we must continue to live in dread of their recurrence."

This play will be presented at the Royal next week by the Oliver Doiid Byron combination. It is a strong and thoroughly sensational drama, replete with thrilling situations, and new realistic scenic and mechanical effects. The company is a strong one, being the same that supported Mr. Byron for the past six years. ""Across the Continent"" is not a play of the ""border"" kind far from it. Among the most notable scenes are the snowstorm, the fire, the picturesque railroad and the exciting telegraph scenes. There is also a full concert scene, giving half an hour's agreeable interlude of fun and minstrelsy by capable performers. Speaking of the above combination, the Charleston Times say: For real fun and enjoyment it would be difficult to find a better collection than is found in ""Across the Continent."" The play is brimful of fun, sparkling, and occasionally intensely pathetic. It is handsomely mounted with fine scenic effects, and above all, there is not a second-class actor in the company."

"18860728","(SPECIAL TO THE HARTFORD COURANT, July 27) The schooner Hailon has arrived bringing the latest news from the Labrador coast. For nearly two weeks she was blocked in York harbor by a field of ice. She brings information from families who had reached that point from Sandwich Bay, ten miles inland, on sledges drawn by ponies, on which they subsisted after their arrival. York harbor is crowded with fugitives, but these came from the southern coast and knew nothing of their northern neighbors. On July 1, a two days' snowstorm set in, cutting off all communication. The snow had closed all trails. Relief vessels will now go direct to York Bay to relieve the first sufferers there. The latest report states that the Hudson Straits are again frozen over, which is an unprecedented occurrence at this season. The temperature has not gone lower than 15 above. The cold results from immense masses of Arctic ice along the coast. The late arrivals have arrived here. The number that have died is estimated at 3,000."
"18860731","THE DISTRESS IN LABRADOR, A Terrible Story of Starving by the Natives, WHO RESORT TO CANNIBALISM, their numbers reduced by Wild Beasts. ST. John's, July 3rd A special says: Hertrich, one of the survivors who arrived here on the Nancy Barrett from Okak, Labrador, says the population of that settlement was nearly 130. When he left with his wife not a soul remained. Early in March food gave out, every drop of oil and bit of sealskin was utilized and at rare intervals a bear was killed, but finally the supplies ran quite exhausted. On June 3rd they had eaten nothing for six days, and goaded by hunger they feasted on the corpses of several of the whites and a few Indians that had been killed by the cold. When one of their own party died the body was cut open, the entrails were taken out and the remainder was frozen for use. From this food terrible dysentery set in among the survivors, and on July 7 there were but sixteen persons left alive, the bodies of over twenty-five having been eaten. Sixteen survivors started down the coast in sledges drawn by four dogs, the only living creatures left them, the ponies having been sacrificed to appease their hunger long before. When about twenty-four miles from Cape Mugford a heavy snowstorm set in. While the party were endeavoring to find their way they were attacked by polar bears to the number of twenty-five or thirty, which killed all of the party but two, the survivors being among the number at Cape Mugford. It is reported that more than one-half of the entire population have died of hunger. Thousands of bears have crossed over from Pennsylvania, ransacked the shore of Okak, dug open graves and devoured the dead and attacked the living. They have devastated an immense district, of which the inhabitants abandoning the smaller settlements have flocked to the larger fishing ports, where they have been followed by hordes of bears and devoured in great numbers. The neighborhood of Hopedale, the center of a considerable soul fishing traffic, has also suffered from lack of food and the ferocity of bears and wolves. Within the past two months 150 persons have perished from cold or hunger, or by falling prey to the wild beasts. Men driven mad by hunger have fought with bears over the remains of their dead companions, the bears being usually successful and securing a double repast. The governor of Newfoundland yesterday received the following despatch from Mayor Howland, of Toronto: Do the necessities of the inhabitants of Labrador make it desirable that I should appeal for help from our citizens?

"18860803","LAEEADOB, The telegram from our well-informed correspondent at St. John's, N.L., which we utilized yesterday, is doubtless a source of relief to the tender-hearted and humane all over the Dominion. We shall shortly, it is to be expected, learn something more as to the origin of the harrowing reports. It may be recalled that the only source of information assigned for circumstantial accounts concerning communities hundreds of miles apart on a coast more than a thousand miles long was the arrival at St. John's of a schooner from Sandwich Bay. The whole story, read in the light of Mr. Harvey's contradiction, has certainly an air of manufactured invention. Even in Labrador, snowstorms do not come on in the middle of July. There is not, we believe, any ""Astoria"" in Labrador, the place so called (from the New York Astors), which played an important part in the history of the Northwest companies, being in Oregon. At the same time, the horrors related were not altogether incongruous with the scene. Those who have visited the coast of Labrador describe it as a grim and terrible wilderness. Of the vast tableland of which the interior consists, Prof. Hind says that language fails to describe its awful desolation. Though much of it is in the same parallels of latitude as Great Britain, the snow lies from September till June. It is a region of far-reaching sterility; only at the heads of the bays and fiords is there any timber. The plains produce only moss. Yet this expanse of barrenness is not without its wild grandeur, and the economic value of its dreary length of coast is very great. These qualities have made it the resort of persons of different aim. For nearly 450 years (some say much longer), its value to the fishermen has been known to portions of Western Europe. Soon after, if not, as some maintain, before the visit of Sebastian Cabot, the Basques came there to reap the harvest of its prolific waters. In 1520, the Bretons built a town near Blanc Sablon, of which the ruins are still visible. Close to its site is the southern limit of the jurisdictions of Canada and Newfoundland, the northern extremity being at Cape Chudleigh. The intervening coast is deeply indented with bays and inlets. One of the first of these is Battle Harbor, near the entrance of the straits of Belle Isle, an important fishing center. Near Battle Island is that tremendous ground swell, the roar of which Admiral Bayfield compared to the thunders of Niagara. The next important inlet is Chateau Bay, so called from the castellated basaltic rock formations at its mouth, where Jacques Cartier's fleet once gathered, and where, long after, some of the expelled Acadians formed a settlement and a fort. Four minor inlets having been passed, Sandwich Bay is reached. It is from this important locality that the schooner Barron was said to have brought the five suffering families to St. John's. It is the deepest of all the coast indentations except one, that of Hamilton Inlet, which lies just round its northern headland. The latter, also called Esquimaux Bay, is of singular conformation. Thirty miles wide at its mouth, at fifty miles from the sea, it narrows to the width of a mile, while on either shore hills, a thousand feet high, tower upwards, covered with spruce from base to summit. Until comparatively recently, few fishermen ventured farther north than Hamilton Inlet. But four years ago, the Rev. Mr. Harvey wrote that a considerable number of Newfoundlanders had gone further north, some of them as far as Cape Mugford; and he hazarded the prediction that before long Cape Chudleigh itself would be their destination. According to one telegram, Cape Chudleigh or Chidley was one of the most terribly stricken of the starved or starving communities. It was, indeed, extraordinary and rather suspicious that we should have detailed information from so many points including, from south to north, Sandwich, Hamilton Inlet, Webeck, Hopedale, Nain, Okkak, Mogford and Chidley. Hopedale, Nain and Okkak are Moravian missionary stations, of which there are six altogether on the coast, the remaining three being Zoar, Hebron and Ramah. There are Hudson's Bay posts at Kigoulette, the Narrows and part of Hamilton's Inlet, at Nachwak, near Ramah; at Cartwright's Harbor and at Davis Inlet. There are, according to Tuttle, about a hundred families of Indians altogether. Mr. Harvey, who makes the whole permanent population 12,500, estimates the Indians at 4,000; the whites on the St. Lawrence coast at 4,411; on the Atlantic, 2,416, and the Esquimaux at 1,700. Game is yearly becoming scarcer and in many parts of the country has disappeared. Among the wild animals are reindeer, black and white bears, wolves, foxes, martens, lynxes, otters, minks, beavers, muskrats, hares, rabbits and moles. The voracity of the hungry bears and wolves was one of the most terrible incidents in the alleged tragedy, as it has reached us. But the tales of cannibalism capped the climax. Eagles, hawks, falcons, owls, ravens, and various aquatic fowls, with partridges, snipe, pigeons, etc., are among the birds. The chief trees are larch, birch, silver fir, aspen, black, red and white spruce, willow, cherry and mountain ash. Berry-bearing plants of all kinds abound in many districts. At Nain, halfway between Hamilton Inlet and Chudleigh, the Hudson's Bay expedition found pretty, neatly enclosed gardens, in which were grown potatoes, turnips, peas, rhubarb, onions, cabbages, lettuce, spinach and a big variety of flowering plants. The present summer must, therefore, have been extremely exceptional, if the rigors reported had any real existence. That some hardships may have been suffered in some localities is not improbable. OVERCROWDED PROFESSIONS Some time ago the College of Physicians of this province issued a circular to professors of colleges and other friends of higher education, in which complaint was made of the low standard of proficiency in certain important branches of study required for students of medicine. The circular protested especially against the tendency to give the natural sciences the preference over mental and moral philosophy and the Latin and Greek classics. It was pointed out that to make it optional for a candidate to substitute such branches as astronomy and geology for those departments of knowledge which form the basis of all sound learning, was simply to open the professions to mere Normal school pupils, and that such a movement could not fail to divert from their classical studies a large number of young men who would seize the opportunity of obtaining their diploma with as little delay as possible. The circular, as might have been expected, gave rise to considerable discussion. While some regarded its proposals for reform as timely and necessary, others thought that their adoption would be a retrograde, rather than a progressive, step. It is the conviction of not a few in the present day that science is more valuable than either philosophy or classics, both for its own sake and for its uses in mental training. In several colleges on both sides of the Atlantic it has in recent years acquired a place in the course of study which was formerly denied to it. In some instances, it is made optional to select science subjects in the later arts years instead of classics. Others have instituted scientific courses, from which classics are entirely eliminated. There are still, however, a good many who believe that, without classical instruction, an education worthy to be called liberal is impossible, and who would agree with the College of Physicians in making it the basis, whatever be the professional superstructure. The truth probably lies in the middle distance from either extreme. It is to another question, however, that we wish to call attention. There is one sentence in the circular that is suggestive, perhaps, in a sense other than what the writers intended. In indicating what they consider a lowering of the standard of requirements for entering on the study of medicine, the authorities of the College of Physicians indirectly deprecated a movement that would swell the ranks of the profession beyond its needs. Now, without engaging in any controversy as to the relative worth of certain studies, we find no difficulty in agreeing with them that therein lies the danger that should by all means be avoided. If the preliminary examinations are made too easy, it must necessarily follow that among those who graduate there will be deficiently educated and therefore inferior men. It is quite possible, indeed, for a young man whose early advantages have been meager, to use such diligence in his purely professional course, as to pass the final test with credit and to become a learned physician or a skillful surgeon. And, if he is all that, some may say, what does it matter whether his training in philosophy, or classics or modern literature be little or nothing? For him the one thing needful is to diagnose, to prescribe, to cure. But they err who argue thus, for an educated physician who is not an educated man is practically impossible. Professional training, even with the highest genius, is a slow process, and if any portion of it be omitted the lack is sure to be felt some time or other. An ignorant man, however great his natural gifts, cannot enter on the study of medicine with any well-founded hope of success. And it is the part of wisdom to set up barriers against the admission of those who are thus defective. Those who have welcomed the proposed amendments of the College of Physicians say that already the professions in this province are overcrowded with inferior men. The Canadien, of Quebec, says that the feeble and ignorant outnumber those who reflect credit on their callings. For this reason, it hails the recommendation of the college. By ""sifting with interrogatories"" all coming candidates, the ranks of the unworthy may be reduced to a minority. But by raising the standard of professional education, the country will gain in another way. At present, so dense is the rush of young men to the ""learned"" professions, that other occupations, which would furnish opportunities for honorable careers, are neglected and despised. Agriculture and stock farming attract young men from Europe to the Northwest. Why not young Canadians? And then there is the vast field of commercial and industrial life, in which there is scope for the highest talents and the most careful training. In none of these will learning come amiss, but many of those who, in the professions, enter a competition where defeat and disappointment await them, would find in those other and more honorable walks of life the road to usefulness and success. It is right in calling attention to turn the mind of the young less toward the professions and more toward those employments that develop the resources of the country while they profit those who engage in them. The inquiry, of course, having multiplied and the matter having represented itself from a new standpoint in the Northwest, in which it is treated without prejudice, the government thinks proper to consider the matter dispassionately. In reply, the government offers to put down ""the condition that the government should be the means of establishing some disinterested institution which shall be established by capitalist and laborers, in case the matter prove to be a finality."" I, on the other hand, it being proved to be genuine and valid, the funds deposited by the government will be devoted to the benefit of the people. Our Quebec Contemporary thinks that we should not be so much surprised at hearing of malicious acts regarding the clergy. Mgr. Lamy maintained that the clergy who saw the agitator at work, when, in a letter read on the floor of the House of Commons, he declared that Kiel was a hypocrite, a renegade who, in his wickedness and maleficent cunning, swindled like one possessed of a devil. It is unfortunate that the old spirit of religious strife should have taken so persistent a hold on some of the inhabitants of the island. Where such a spirit has predominated, the sturdiest spark of provocation is still fit to influence a whole community with the worst animus of faction. The circumstances under which the recent riots and fatalities occurred make the tragedy all the more deplorable. A band of music going to meet an excursion party of Sunday school children was, as usual in such cases, interrupted by a crowd. The latter, passing a locality where some Roman Catholics had assembled, could not resist the temptation of insulting them and began to groan at them. The retaliation was quick, and from their vantage ground on a hill, the taunted Roman Catholics replied with stones. The challenge was taken up and the outlying faction fight was engaged in. Rumor soon exaggerated both the disturbance and its cause, and a body of Orangemen came to the help of their fellow-religionists. In a little while the crowd had become a mob, and with a mob's impulses, looked for some object of outrage. Then the police appeared on the scene and the battle between authority and disorder began. The guardians of the peace, helpless against volleys of stones, were ordered to fire buckshot and the order was obeyed. And then comes the result of all this bigotry. The real offenders escape. A poor boy, going on an errand, is shot dead and several other persons are wounded. Finally, the soldiers are called out and the mob disperses. But the rioting is renewed next day, property is wantonly destroyed and lives are endangered. It is a miserable business altogether. If there is any real patriotism in Ireland, it could not be directed to a better end than the quelling of the direful spirit of religious strife which has been the bane of the country."

In naming the law he stated he was not a member of the order, and therefore knew nothing of its mysticism or its forms, and it was only as a charitable inquiry that it was known to him. He did not know in what respect it was a Christian organization, but this he did know, that the objects aimed at and the principles which underlie those objects are truly Christian. From the text he adduced a golden chain with the three links Christ, the truth; the law of Christ, which is the law of love; and the outcome of that law, which is practical charity. In other words, these links were friendship, relief, and truth. The work of Christ had brought in heaven for mankind, and His was a sympathy of action, not of words, and so must it be with His followers. To bear the dead, to comfort the afflicted, to care for the needy, and to help a brother who had fallen to rise again were part of a Christian's work, and this was surely part of Christ's work.

I think I may fairly add to these figures those of about 138,008 adults and 26,000 children which represent admissions in connection with the workingmen's clubs which were established at my request in the different parts of the country in the early part of the year. We thus have a total of 2,883,000.""

"18861124","II0WT8EY ARRANGED THE STEAL TO ulna ll imxion n to Win, Made the II o I Atniliihln Oder, New York, November 23 Thanjuy inlh Idei charged With bribery in connection with the giantilig of a franchise to the Broadway Surface railroad, came into court this afternoon, after having been out twenty hours from 8 o'clock last night, and len irled that they were unable to agree, whereupon they were sent back till 11 o'clock this evening. The trial abounded in exciting incidents. The Allenluili Killgraft's evidence was of a most astounding nature. According to him, and he professes to have been induced by remorse, to make a clean breast of the whole business, he went into the combination of thirteen, which proposed to share the profits of the aldermanic business of 1884 as coolly as any of the rest, and the first meeting of this syndicate of corruption was held at his store. The proceedings of that syndicate were conducted in a manner as calm and businesslike as if it were engaged in the most legitimate of money-making transactions. It was organized and had a chairman, and discussed and voted upon the proposition before it as though it were a board of trustees for a financial institution. It considered two business propositions, one for $750,000, half in cash and half in bonds, from the Cable company, and one for $500,000 in cash from the Broadway Surface company for the privilege of laying tracks in Broadway. The latter was accepted as the more advantageous, there being some distrust of the cable company and some fear of difficulty in placing the bonds. This evidence was attacked on the ground that it contradicts the testimony given by FullgralT before the Senate investigating committee. In his charge to the jury the Recorder referred to this and pointed out that the testimony of the accomplices FullgralT and Dully must be corroborated by extrinsic testimony. The defendant could not be convicted on their testimony alone. They must be reinforced by other testimony which tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime. FullgralT and Dully, he said, had confessed to violating their official oaths, and the former had also confessed to committing perjury in his testimony before the Legislative committee and this should be used against them in determining what weight should be given to their testimony. But, in spite of their perjuries, if their testimony had been corroborated by other facts and circumstances, then the jury would be warranted in finding that they had told the truth. Dully, however, should not be allowed to corroborate FullgralT or Kullg-aff Dully. Each must be corroborated by testimony outside of the other. The jury had the absolute right to discard the testimony of both. The recorder drew the attention of the jury to the fact that the defendant was not charged with receiving a bribe, but with having made a promise to, or an agreement with someone, that his vote as an alderman of New York should be cast in favor of the charter of the Broadway Surface railroad. The charge on the whole was regarded as favorable to the prisoner, and was objected to on several grounds by the District Attorney. At 9 o'clock the jury went out to deliberate. At 10 o'clock tonight the jury once more entered the court, reported that they were unable to agree, and asked to be discharged, stating that there was no seeming possibility of their coming to a unanimous verdict. Recorder Smythe was unwilling to agree to this request, in view of the importance of the case, and the fact that the prosecution of the rest of the thirteen will probably hang upon the result of this trial, and ordered them back till tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. A private telegram in this city last evening stated that eight jurymen were in favor of acquitting McQuade and four against.

He leaves a widow and three children in England. A Bill BLAZE The Dominion Oilcloth Factory Outted - Valuable Plant Destroyed - Efficient Services by the Fire Brigade - Damages $40,000 Covered by Insurance. An extensive and disastrous fire took place last evening in the factory of the Dominion Oilcloth company, Nos. 62 to 81 Parthenan street. It appears that the employees left their work at 5 o'clock, but one of them was left doing some few odd jobs. He was working in the south end of the building by the light of a lamp, when he upset it and it exploded. Though there was a water ex k Hh hose attached within three feet of him, had he turned on which would have instantly extinguished the blaze, the man lost his presence of mind and ran outside to give the alarm. Meanwhile, the floor being soaked with oil, and quantities of combustible materials lying around, the flames spread with lightning-like rapidity, and in the space of a few minutes part of the building was one seething mass of flame. By this time, however, an alarm was sounded from box 121, and the eastern division of the brigade quickly responded. On the arrival of the firemen the spectacle presented was a magnificent one, the flames shooting high up into the air, and illuminating the sky for a considerable distance around. Seeing the serious nature of the fire, Sub-chief Nam sent out a second alarm, which called out the central division of the brigade, and streams were laid all around the blazing factory from the Nos. 1, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 13. Ladders were raised up to the roof, and from this elevated position Nos. 2 and 8 formed a perfect deluge of water. The firemen fought the flames gallantly and at a disadvantage as a numbing snowstorm was in progress, and the excitement was deepened by the frequent explosions of barrels of naphtha, which, as they caught fire, went off with reports like a salvo of artillery. The water pressure was excellent, the 8-inch mains on Dorchester avenue and St. Catherine street giving such a copious supply that there was no need to work the steamers. Two hours' hard work got the fire under control, but not before the building was completely gutted. The walls appear to be safe, but the roof is in danger of falling in. The stock and material in the factory were totally destroyed, and the valuable engraved copper rolls and machinery badly damaged. The Salvage corps spread six covers over the latter to protect them. The firm cannot estimate the damage until they inspect the plant this morning, but it will not be under $40,000; covered by insurance spread over a number of companies. Sergeant Hilton, of No. 2 Police station, efficiently kept the crowd back with a posse of police."

"18861201","FRENCH CATTLE The agricultural department has addressed a protest to the French Government against the continuation of the prohibition against French cattle. They claim that the disease which led to the country being scheduled has long ago disappeared, and that the interests of the country are being prejudiced unnecessarily. With Mr. Chiji and others in office it will be difficult to have the restrictions removed, especially after Norway being so summarily shut out with, as some allege, very little reason. AGRICULTURAL RETURNS The summarized results of the agricultural returns for 1880 were published last night. The diminution of area under wheat is attributed to unremunerative prices, also to the unfavorable seed time in the autumn of 1885, the spring of the present year, and to foreign competition inducing farmers to devote land to grazing purposes, also land ploughed up, and other crops substituted where wheat failed. It is further stated that, in the majority of cases, little wheat is grown where the land is in the owners' hands. The extension of permanent pasture in Great Britain is again remarkable, amounting to an increase of 192,800 acres over the year 1885. Inclement weather and scarcity of keep are noticed as having told upon the cattle, whilst the obligation to retain was to very many farmers imperative. It is mentioned that in some districts Irish store stock are now bought in preference to rearing calves. It is reported that the lambing season, owing to the severe weather in the spring, was unfavorable in the majority of districts, all mountainous or hilly countries suffering especially from this cause. The exceptionally heavy rate of mortality among sheep during the prolonged winter was owing to the failure of the root crops last year, and ewes were left generally in too low condition to rear their lambs. Thousands of sheep were sent to the butchers only half fat, whilst the losses to individual owners from snowstorms have been serious in many instances."

"18861203","A NEW ARTIFICIAL LIGHT, the Lodges on Exhibition at Messrs. Robert Mitchell & Co. have on exhibition a new style of lamp, the ""Lucigen,"" that is something of a hybrid between gas and oil. Air is pumped into a receiver, the pressure being kept at between 20 and 30 lbs, and being forced into the oil tank carries up the oil in the form of vapor through the burner. It is lighted in the same way as gas and gives a steady blaze which lights up the surroundings to a considerable distance. The light is steady and soft, causes no smoke or smell, and the only disagreeable feature about it is the noise, which, however, will hardly be noticed in a workshop. The light in question is 2,000 candle power and burns two gallons of oil per hour, the tank having a capacity of fifty gallons. The following advantages are claimed for the ""Lucigen"": It gives a large broad flame which does not dazzle the eyes. It lights up every part of the surrounding area equally with a clear soft light. It is more distributive in quality than the electric light, one Lucigen being equal for effective lighting to four electric arc lamps. It does not cast black shadows like the electric light, and gives off neither smoke nor smell. It is much cheaper both in first cost and maintenance than either electricity or gas. It requires no attention after being lit, and the apparatus is not liable to get out of order. It is very portable, and can be readily sent to wherever the light is most required. It is produced at a nominal expenditure of power, requires no adjustment of machinery, and needs no skilled labor. This invention is the property of Hillsinay's Est. company, of Glasgow, Scotland, and Mr. Mitchell are the sole agents for the Dominion. THE FIRE ENGINE TEST. The achievements of the Herald Engineering Saturday - What Kambari of the committee say. The long talked of test of the combined steam fire engines took place yesterday, beside the Montreal Warehousing company's elevator, on Mill street. Though the weather was very cold, and a blinding snowstorm was in progress, there were quite a number of spectators present, including Aldermen Stevenson, Wilson, P. Spinning and Malone, of the Fire committee; Chief Pallon, Chief McCullin, Captain John Hockingham, Guardians Bishop and Gilbert of the brigade; the chiefs of St. Henri, Collelen and Machine brigade; Captain Wright, Messrs. Frank Redpath, Peter Cooper, Robert Whits and Mensies. The judges were Guard-Inn Nollin, of the Central fire station, and Mr. Champagne, the boiler inspector. The test was to have taken place at 10 o'clock, but owing to some misunderstanding as to the quantity of water to be used, it was after 11 o'clock before the proceedings commenced. After the test was lit the following were the results registered on the steam gauge: Five minutes 30 seconds, 10 lbs; 6 minutes, 15 lbs; 7 minutes, 20 lbs; 8 minutes 31 seconds, 30 lbs; 9 minutes 10 seconds, 40 lbs; 10 minutes, 50 lbs. Here a double length of hose, at one end to a Y, was laid on from the hydrant, two lengths of 200 feet of hose coupled by a Y were attached to the engine and a stream was thrown up beside the elevator through a 1-inch nozzle."

Partridges sold at 65c to 60c per brace, and venison at 6c to 7c for carcasses and 9c to 10c for saddles per lb. Butter Although trade in butter has not been out of the ordinary character and volume, the market has preserved a steady tone, consequent on the existing belief that the supply to meet the winter's trade will at the most prove barely sufficient. It is certain that stocks here are moderate, and it seems to be equally certain that the supplies held in the country are also moderate; in fact, advices from several The New York Commercial Bulletin says: Butter has been on the mend during the week and in several instances there is a small gain on price shown. Delayed supplies consequent upon the snowstorms was a partially stimulating factor, but a pretty good demand has helped matters and in a general way the situation is cheerful and healthy. Nice fresh flavored goods were the quickest to sell, but all table butter has seen more or less attention and there has continued a particularly full demand for medium grade. These latter are taken by dealers in place of substitutes, and as consumers become accustomed to the change, it is expected that demand will increase. Low grades of butter have become very scarce, and a search for cheap lots continues. There was no apparent change in the position today. The foreign demand was not urgent; in fact, there seemed to be little inquiry, but in view of the light offerings and the indifference of sellers the firm tone was well maintained; finer priced stock is notably scarce. The cable was unchanged at 11s 1d. The export from New York for the week is given at only 4,700 tons. Finest Sept and Oct colored, 12 to 12 Finest Sept and Oct while 12 to 24 Fine II, II to Milium Kral, les, lower grades. The New York Commercial Bulletin of today's date says: Cheese has been very slow, yet apparently gaining in tone, and small fractional changes in valuation were made to a blither level. A large proportion of the business on foreign account was in under-priced goods, skins, etc., and no general negotiation over fancies could be learned of, but the terms of the latter were of the most indifferent character, and only on a stiff limit. Indeed, as the cheap lots gradually become picked off and the supply rounds up, holders seem to become more confident and appearances are very strong. The statisticians are again at work on estimates of stock, and the latest reliable figures are placed at about 117,000 to 130,000 boxes here, 70,000 to 75,000 at Liverpool, 126,000 at Manchester, and 170,000 for Canada.

"18861224","BISMARCK AND THE ARMY BILL DIMINISHED NATURE - A Hellish Threat to Turkey, Rome, December 23 The Pope, receiving Christmas congratulations from the College of Cardinals, spoke at some length of the position of the church in Italy. He protested against the anti-clerical movement which is being carried on in the country, and said the Holy See was now despoiled of the last remnants of its patrimony. The only liberty left to him was that held by the Roman Pontiffs in the earlier ages. The Italian Government, he declared, had assisted the laity in unduly interfering with the administration of the church, and had expelled religious bodies and had tolerated an organized hostility against the Vatican. As the head of the church he must continue to protest against the position in which he is placed. The German Army Bill, Berlin, December 23 The North German Gazette emphatically denies the reports of the Progressist press that Prince Bismarck declares against dissolving the Reichstag and that the Government hopes to reach an understanding with the Reichstag on the basis of the Centre's proposals. The Gazette adds that in Government circles there exists no doubt whatever of the necessity of maintaining the Army bill at any price. It is reported that Dr. Windthorst has informed General Von Schellendorff, minister of war, that if the Government should proceed with the formation of new cadres for the 1st of April the Reichstag would be certain to give a bill of indemnity, but the Centre would go no further. The commission of staff officers continues making arrangements for new troops just as if the bill was already passed. The War ministry is hastening the production of repeating rifles. The Jutt states that the workmen in the factories at Spandau have been refused the usual Christmas holidays. It is expected that the Landtag will meet on January 14. Among the bills to be introduced is a new measure for an organic revision of the May laws. Berlin will be illuminated on January 1 in honor of the eightieth anniversary of Emperor William's entry into the army. It is rumored that the Emperor will seize the occasion to make an address to the Reichstag deploring its attitude on the military bill. For Sweet Charity's Sake, Berlin, December 23 D'Oyley Carte company gave the special matinee performance of the Mikado yesterday in behalf of the Crown Princess fund to establish a home in Berlin for British and American governesses.

"18861225","MUSIO AND THE DRAMA, THE MAIN LINK will be given New Year's week at the Academy of Music. Mr. Charles Barnard, editor of the Century Magazine, and Mr. Henry O. De Mille, formerly the reader of plays at the Madison Square Theatre, united in the composition of The Main Line, the play that will occupy the Academy stage from Tuesday next to Saturday, with a grand New Year's matinee. It had its premiere at the Lyceum in New York, early in the season, and won so much success that it was only driven from that stage by imperative engagements that could not be bought off. Since then it has been brought forward in Western cities with satisfaction in the audience and at the box office. The plot deals with the love story of Rossy, the daughter of the station master at the far-away railroad depot in Colorado. As the telegraph operator there, she becomes acquainted with and forms an attachment for Lawrence Patton, an artist who is sketching in the neighborhood. In two scenes her duty is powerfully contrasted with her love, and her choice to do what is right under temptation to that which is wrong and that might bring her sweetheart to her arms forms the motive of the narrative. Three of the acts are laid in the open air, with the railroad track, depot, and telegraph office in the foreground and a background of Colorado mountain scenery. The fourth act shows the interior of the station master's house at Grand Junction, a Rocky Mountain snowstorm raging without, the wires singing their mournful song, and the snow plough plunging through the drifts. The cast includes Miss Etta Hawkins as Join, and Mr. HIRU, December 21. As business was about to close on the market today, a rumor was circulated to the effect that Emperor William was in a critical condition. The rumor failed to affect prices which closed down, the market having recovered from yesterday's digression.

A HEAVY SNOWSTORM Great Britain Visited by the Heaviest Snowfall for Many Years Great Damage to Telegraphy London, December 27 The severest snowstorm ever known in Great Britain has been sweeping England during the past twenty-four hours, and still continues. Trains on all the roads have been blocked, and travel in many instances has been entirely suspended. The telegraph wires in every direction are prostrated, and for a period of several hours London was entirely cut off from communication with the outside world. Only meager accounts from nearby stations of the damage wrought have been received. New York, December 27 The general manager in New York of one of the cable companies has received the following information from the agent of the line at Bristol, England, regarding the snowstorm in England yesterday: The snowstorm in England appears to have done an amount of damage to the telegraph wires which is unprecedented. The telegraph wires in London last night were snapping with alarming rapidity, and in Fleet Street the policemen curled the broken ends round the lamp posts. A train on the Midland line was delayed over an hour by the falling of telegraph wires across the track. There was very severe weather at Reading yesterday. The snow that fell in the afternoon was heavier than had been experienced for years, whilst the wind blew a hurricane, causing considerable damage to the roofs of houses. Trees were also badly damaged. In Sunning cutting on the Great Western railway the trains were delayed by snow drifts. On the line from Paddington to Reading and from Bath to Bristol all the telegraph poles are a perfect wreck, most of the poles being splintered like match wood and lying in all directions. The railway block lines being down, the trains are considerably delayed and are signaled along the line by flags. It seems probable that wires between Bristol and London will not be restored for two or three days. The telegraphs in other directions have suffered equally as far as can be ascertained. There is no one article in the line of medicines that gives so large a return for the money as a good porous strengthening plaster, such as Carter's Smart Weed and Belladonna Backache Plasters. Capt.

Even Prince Edward Island, a strip of land 150 miles long and having an average width not exceeding twenty miles, with but four months (June, July, August and September) of really pleasant weather during the year, with a population largely composed of farmers, who still persist in driving a distance of twenty-five miles to a circus or fair or political meeting rather than patronize the railway, even at a nominal excursion rate of fare, and with no rail connection from which to receive or to which to deliver business, possesses all the comforts and conveniences of rapid transit. Private capital, however, did not supply it, the Government, which in the case of Canada is entitled to be considered paternal in the true sense of the word, going down into its own pockets and supplying the needful. In no other way could the island have secured THE BLESSING OF A RAILWAY. It is doubtful if any considerable proportion of the people of this country even know that a railway exists on Prince Edward Island, still fewer that one has so existed since the spring of 1871, when the Prince Edward Island railway was opened for traffic. True, it is not a standard gauge road, but then the island is only a narrow strip of land and in respect both to its size and its products and population is better adapted to the narrower width. Even this has not been profitable and it is questionable if it would have been kept in as good condition as the writer found it if it were not owned by the Canadian Government and operated by it partly as a means of developing the island and bettering the condition of its inhabitants, and partly as a means of securing and retaining its loyalty and good will as an important spoke in the governmental wheel. The Canadian roads are not operated, in so far as the Government is concerned, so much for profit as to develop the magnificent resources of the country penetrated by them. There is no section of all the provinces so remote, so ill-favored in its topography, so sterile or so utterly unknown to the public and to fame that it does not already enjoy or expect to possess in the near future railway communication with the outside world. And this great boon the Government is confidently expected to supply. TO THE CREDIT OF THE DOMINION GOVERNMENT be it said that it has not for a moment permitted, nor does it intend to permit this little road to degenerate in the least degree. In fact, the policy which seems to prevail is based on the true foundational idea that what is worth doing at all is worth doing well. Now that the road has been built and equipped it would be most unwise, even wicked, to neglect its physical welfare. Little by little it has been improved, its rolling stock perfected and increased, its bridges renewed and strengthened until its condition can best be described by saying that it is in keeping with the magnificent island it has rendered hospitable. From a small beginning twelve years ago or more it has gone on growing, little by little, until there are now 210.00 miles of line in operation, as follows: Miles, Main line from Alberton to Georgetown 147, Branch from Mt. Stewart to Haurhi 88, Branch from Alberton to Tignish 13, Branch from county line to Cape Traverse 12, Total 210.00. On those various divisions are 25 telegraph or booking stations and 50 flag stations. The lines between Charlottetown, Summerside and Cape Traverse, and a portion of the distance between Charlottetown and Mt. Stewart, have steel rails. Originally all bridges were of wood, but as renewals are made iron is being substituted. THE ROLLING STOCK OF THE ROAD on June 30 last consisted of 21 locomotives, 17 first class cars, 2 postal cars, 3 vans, 1 pay car, 175 box and stock cars, 109 platform cars (other than coal), 16 coal cars, 8 snow ploughs, 7 hangers. With the exception of a few stock cars, all the box, flat and stock cars constituting the original freight equipment of the road have been renewed, ten and fifteen ton cars being substituted for eight ton cars, as a means of increasing the earning capacity of trains without corresponding increase in the number of cars to be hauled. No one who has never operated a railway surrounded and so closely approached as is this one by salt water, can understand or appreciate the difficulties to be encountered which are peculiar to this circumstance. A very annoying and at the same time interesting illustration of this fact was observed by the writer during his visit to the company's shops at Charlottetown. This is the rapid formation of a thick crust (a compromise between rust and the crust formed on the inside of boilers) on journals, wheels and other articles made of iron which are exposed to the elements, and this forms so readily as to involve the company, or rather the Government, which in this case is the company, in the necessity of frequent renewals and considerable expense which would not be necessary otherwise. Even the nickel and silver plated trimmings on the inside of passenger coaches in a few months not only lose all their brilliancy but actually suffer almost the complete loss of their entire plating. Thus far no means seem to have been discovered for avoiding the ravages of this invisible destroyer which seems to fasten itself upon all metallic articles on this island as a parasite fastens itself upon growing vegetation. An excellent opportunity is here offered to any of our manufacturers of lamps, package racks, hat and coat hooks, window catches, etc., necessarily used by railways, to provide a combination of metals or a special plating which will withstand this common enemy. A New Yorker who happened to be in Boston for a day availed himself of the opportunity to make a social call. He was shown into the parlor, and while waiting there a nurse entered with a little baby in her arms. ""Itty, pitty, tootsey, wootsey,"" said the New Yorker, addressing his conversation to the infant. ""Oor'y, booty, goosy, noosy."" At this juncture the child set up a bowl.

""SALISBURY'S ULTIMATUM,"" ""If Burlington will not support the Cabinet he will dissolve Parliament,"" Burlington Refutes; ""s,"" ""r"" the Minister, ""by barring bills McGuanin Discarded,"" London, December 28. The Queen maintains constant communication with the Marquis of Salisbury. It is declared that the Premier has no intention to resign. The Cabinet met at 12:00 o'clock this afternoon and considered the resignation of Lord Randolph Churchill. The other members of the Cabinet agreed with Lord Salisbury that Lord Darlington should be asked to join a coalition ministry. At the Cabinet meeting today Lord Salisbury read the correspondence that had passed between himself and Lord Randolph Churchill relative to the latter's resignation. He explained the nature of the negotiations with Lord Hartington, who, he said, seemed to take an interest in the Cabinet, and strongly favored a Tory successor to Lord Churchill. The Cabinet left the matter in Lord Salisbury's hands, who will probably renew his offer to Lord Hartington. After the Cabinet meeting Lord Salisbury proceeded to Windsor Castle and conversed and dined with the Queen. He will pass the night at the castle. The Queen will go to Osborne tomorrow. It is believed that Lord Hartington is at Monte Carlo. The snowstorm of last evening put a stop to all telegraphic communication. Political gossips are busily discussing reports of a long interview between Sir Michael Hicks-Beach and Mr. Matthews, home secretary, after the Cabinet meeting today. Lord Salisbury informed the Cabinet he would not attempt to conciliate Lord Churchill, and that if Lord Hartington refused to accept office or guarantee the Government adequate support from the Unionists he proposed to dissolve Parliament and appeal to the country on the former Colonist platform, adding planks in favor of the adoption of new procedure rules, the precedence of an English local government measure over an Irish measure, a vigorous foreign policy and moderate estimates. Lord Churchill's reasons for resigning, as stated at the Cabinet council, included objections to allowing a sum for increasing the defenses of ports and coaling stations in the budget. Similar estimates had been already approved by Mr. Gladstone and Sir William Vernon Harcourt. After the council, prominent members of the ministerial circle spoke of Churchill's budget as a mountebank scheme which was meant to dazzle the ignorant democracy. The Ministers are confident that Lord Hartington will rally his whole powers in support of the Government. UNITED STATES DISPATCHES Another Mississippi Fire, Cairo, IL, December 28.

"18870104","COMMERCIAL Uazkttk OrKioE, Monday Evening European llrendslulls The British grain markets continued strong and the cables to-day were bullish in tone, with wheat higher again. London quoted 6dals per quarter advance, and Liverpool 1d 2d per cental. Red winter for prompt shipment or for shipment during the month was at 80s Od, California just shipped or promptly to be at 40s, and do neatly due at 8s Od. Cargoes on passage or for shipment were firmly held, but with fewer buyers. The country markets were dearer. Deliveries of wheat by farmers during the week were 86,000 and 85,000 quarters, the average price of which was 86s. Wheat in Liverpool was strong at the advance; spring 7s 6d 7s 8d and No. 1 California 7s 1d 7s 11d. The markets in Mark Lane were healthy, with No. 2 club Calcutta ex-ship quoted 1s 3d higher at 35s. Minneapolis straight flour was 1d dearer at 25s. KiiIIimI NUtifM Mrnlu Marhela Wheat in Chicago continued to forge ahead under the encouraging cables; which reported the existence of a strong feeling abroad. Prices advanced 1c on good buying and the close was firm at 80.54c January, 81c February, 87.54c May. The corn market was quiet and about steady, closing at 37.4c January, 74c February, 43.54c May. Oats closed at 21.4c January, 21c February, 20c May. To-day's inspection was 10 cars white wheat, 26 spring, 260 corn and 102 oats. Mllinlno, Hodman A Co. of Chimin, review the situation as follows: We have had another week of unsettled wheat markets, but a substantial advance seems to have been established all around. The purchases for export, as reported by the seaboard, have been heavy, still the actual clearances show but a trifling increase. Some decrease in receipts is noticeable; however, a slight increase in next week's statement of the visible supply seems probable. There have been heavy snowstorms west and northwest during the week, which will, to some extent, impede railroad traffic, and a further falling off in receipts, in consequence, may be looked for. The estimates of stocks in the United Kingdom, issued on 1st of January, it is said, will show only 13,000,000 bushels, as against 18,000,000 at the same time last year. But as the quantity in sight and afloat, taken altogether, is considerably larger than one year ago, the above showing of stocks, even if verified by official figures, will not be much of a bull argument after all. We think about the strongest factor in the legitimate situation at the present time, is the limited stock of flour, both at home and abroad, as compared with last year. The tendency of markets abroad continues very strong, and the demand continuing, as it does, in the face of advance on this side, we conclude the underlying causes are legitimate, and are likely to become more urgent as time passes. The temper of the speculative element on this side is now quite generally favorable to further advance. There is a more settled and confident feeling in business and financial circles generally, and the active operators in all speculative commodities seem marked, ready now for a boom along the whole line. The advance in provisions is offering no little support to grain. Looks very much to us as if an advance of another dollar or two on pork might be expected, and with the bullish feeling so generally prevailing, any pronounced advance or excitement in any one speculative commodity is likely to affect the whole list in the same direction. A very marked increase in speculative activity during the week is noticeable. We still incline to the opinion, so often expressed in these columns of late, that we shall see materially higher prices on wheat during the coming month. At the seaboard wheat was strong, and advanced 1.5c, closing at 91.5c January, 91.5c February, 96.5c March, 98.5c April, 88.5c May.

Wheat was firm in accord with the strength elsewhere, but values must be taken more or less nominal. Peas and oats were quiet, with a few cars of barley selling. We quote: Canada red winter wheat, 86c; white winter, 84c; Canada spring, 84c; peas, 67.54c, 15Kc per 60 lbs; oats, 27c, 29c per 33 lbs; rye, 45c bid; barley, 66c, 70c; corn, 65c, duty paid, and 48c in bond. There was a quiet market for flour, but the year has commenced on a firm basis, owing to the course of the wheat market and the firm advices from millers, several of whom have made important transactions for export. Sellers, therefore, are inclined to adopt a more indifferent attitude and hold for more money. The volume of business today was small, but prices were firm with the disposition to quote higher. Manitoba strong bakers' was quiet with sales of three cars at $4.40. On 'Change sales mentioned were 135 barrels patent at $4.60, 126 do at $4.60 and 125 choice superior at $4.05. Quotations of the upper grade are revised toward a higher level, latest choice superior extra, $4.10, $4.60, $4.05, $4.96, $4.80, $4.10, $4.05, $4.00. Superfine $4.00, $4.00, $4.00, $4.00, $4.00.

SERGEANT BALLANTINE, Inquest at the Largest Fee Record, Passes Away, Aged 75, London, January 10. William Ballantine, the well-known sergeant-at-law, is dead, aged 76. He was born in London in 1812, and was called to the bar in 1834. For some years he practiced in the criminal courts, in 1860 was created sergeant-at-law, and was engaged in many cases of considerable importance. He received a patent of precedence from Lord Westbury. Amongst other notable cases he was counsel for the claimant in his original suit to acquire the Tichborne baronetcy and estates in 1871. In 1869 he was appointed, by vote of the House of Commons, to conduct, in conjunction with Mr. Barry, the Irish attorney-general, the legal proceedings against the mayor of Cork, Mr. O'Sullivan, who had made himself conspicuous by the violent expression of his political sentiments on various occasions, and had eulogized, at a public banquet, the Fenian O'Karrull, who had attempted to assassinate the Duke of Edinburgh in Australia. The House of Commons ordered prosecution to be instituted, but Mr. O'Sullivan resigned his office, and consequently the affair came to an end. In 1875 Sergeant Ballantine received a brief to go special to India to defend a native prince, Mulbar Rao, the Gaikwar of Baroda, charged with an attempt to poison Col. Phayre, the British resident. The retainer was 5,000 guineas and a further scale of fees was arranged being estimated at not less than a further sum of 5,000 guineas. This honorarium is probably the largest ever paid to counsel. The commission which tried the case was divided in opinion, the native members holding the Gaikwar's guilt not proved and the result was an acquittal, but the Imperial Government deposed the Gaikwar on the ground of incapacity and misconduct. In 1882 Sergeant Ballantine published his autobiography under the title of Experiences of a Barrister's Life, which went through many editions and was full of interesting incidents. DIED DOING THEIR DUTY Terribly Fatal Shipwreck off the Coast of Virginia, OVER TWENTY LIVES SACRIFICED, Five Lifesaving Men Narrate Their Lives in an Attempt to Save a Perishing Crew, Norfolk, Va., January 8. One of the most disastrous shipwrecks which ever occurred on the Virginia coast happened at two o'clock this morning, near the Little Island life-saving station, fourteen miles south of Cairo Henry. Not less than twenty and probably more lives were lost, among them five life-saving men who, in the discharge of their duty, were drowned. The morning was bitterly cold, and a blinding snowstorm prevailed with the wind blowing a gale from the northeast. During a lull in the storm the life-saving patrol from Little Island life-saving station spotted a ship stranded on the bar about 80 yards from the shore. When he saw the vessel he was waiting to meet the patrol from Dam Neck station and exchange checks showing that both men had been to the end of their beat. The Dam Neck patrol was only a few yards distant when the vessel was sighted and both fired rockets to notify the crew of the stranded ship that she had been seen. They hurried back to their respective stations and gave the alarm. In a little while both crews with lifeboats and apparatus were abreast of the wreck and the boom of a mortar announced that a line had been shot out to the ill-fated vessel. The shot was unsuccessful and a second was fired with like result. After firing six unsuccessful shots the life-saving men, realizing the death which was certain to await the venture, the word of command being given by Capt. Swain, of life-saving station No. 4, known as Little Island, one of the most expert boatmen manned each boat and at his command gave way with a will and in a moment both boats were breasting the furious waves. They reached the ship in safety and five of the ship's crew were taken in a lifeboat and ten in a ship's boat, which was launched for the purpose. The boats were headed for shore and not a word was spoken, for each man realized the awful peril which surrounded them. With a steady pull the two boats were making good headway for shore when a wave of great power struck both boats, capsizing them instantly and pitching their twenty-two occupants into the boiling sea. Then began a desperate struggle for life, and with many of the men it was prolonged. The horrified life-savers on the beach were powerless to assist their drowning comrades or the unfortunate strangers. The drowning men were carried southward by the sea, and some of them were washed ashore. As they came within reach they were picked up and endeavors were made to revive them, in two instances with success, although one of the two is badly injured. The vessel is the German ship Elizabeth, Capt. Halberstadt, from Hamburg to Baltimore, and not one of her crew survives her wreck. Her cargo is unknown, as the high seas have thus far prevented any attempt to reach her. LATER DETAILS, Norfolk, Va., January 9. Later particulars from the wreck put the number of the crew at twenty-two instead of fifteen, not a man of whom was saved. This fact is learned from the two men of the life-saving crew who survive and who recovered consciousness today. The bodies of the five men of the life-saving crew and four of the ship's crew, which were recovered yesterday, were in life preservers, and three mates of the ship's crew without life preservers were picked up lower down the coast this morning. A body which has been identified as that of the captain is among those recovered. This evening the masts of the ship were still standing, though the sea was breaking over her violently. THE MORNING BLAZE, Exeter, Ont., January 9. About 1:30 this morning an alarm of fire was sounded through the village. It was found that Mr. Rosenburger's bakery and confectionery store was on fire. The fire soon spread to Snell Bros.' butcher shop, which was consumed in flames. The fire brigade was promptly on hand and was quickly playing on the fire with good effect, and with the help of citizens with pails in the effort to prevent it from spreading to the adjoining buildings, which were only about one foot apart from the burning one. Mr. Rosenburger's loss will be considerable, and only a part of his furniture and stock were saved. Mrs. Taylor, who lived over the butcher shop, only saved part of her furniture. The buildings were owned by Mr. Charles Southcott and Mr. John Smallacombe, and were insured for $3,000. Their loss will not be very heavy as the buildings were both frame. A TOWN DESTROYED, Dallas, Tex., January 8. The town of Duck Creek, containing 300 inhabitants, situated ten miles north of this city, was destroyed yesterday by fire. Loss $100,000; no insurance.

"18870113","CANADA (From our own reporter) Toronto, January 12 This great match, which has excited so much interest in the curling circles of the continent, was played in the city rinks today in the presence of a large number of spectators, who had assembled from far and near to witness the grand struggle of the two nations with stone and besom. The weather was mild and pleasant with a slight snowstorm in the afternoon. Twenty-nine rinks on either side took part in the contest, which was keenly, although as the result shows, not very closely contested, the Canadians winning easily by 272 shots. The decisions of Col. Stevenson, the popular umpire from Montreal, gave entire satisfaction. He was, however, seldom called upon to act professionally, thanks to the harmony which everywhere existed between the red and blue. Visitors from Montreal were conspicuous by their absence, much to the disgust of their gallant representative, the Colonel, who had hoped to make up a Montreal rink, with which to challenge anything or everything on the field. The fun will be kept up till the end of the week, as the majority of the curlers remain to play less important matches, and they will no doubt have a big time of it.

The committee expected all the clubs to be forward by the evening of that day, but the Western lads were detained in a snow drift and did not turn up until Wednesday morning. The snowstorm also prevented several clubs from starting out, and it was found that only twenty-nine of the promised forty rinks had reported from the States. The Canadians were prepared to play the full number, consequently several of the visiting clubs were debarred from entering the rinks, while the city clubs were only called upon to furnish one rink each. The game consisted of twenty-five ends. Play was commenced at the Granite, Mutual Street and Adelaide Street rinks promptly at 11 o'clock. An adjournment was made at 1, when a substantial lunch was partaken of. Play was resumed at two, and shortly after four all the cards were in the hands of the secretary. The Granite rink was the centre of attraction. Here 29 rinks were accommodated inside and 9 outside, the weather being mild and pleasant for outside play.

"18870117","C. Uenshaw announced that the tenders for the erection of the new clubhouse would be issued in a few days, and said that without doubt the club would be in their new quarters before the end of the year. He hoped that the members who had not already taken shares would do so, as the assistance of every man in the club was needed. A new member, Mr. Dawes, of Lachine, responded to this invitation by taking ten shares. Others followed his example. The evening was brought to a close by the singing of the national anthem. A move was made to the railway station, where they found the Montreal club. Both clubs fraternized, and on arrival at old Bonaventure marched to the Montreal gymnasium, where the rest of the evening was spent in song and dance. A joint tramp of both clubs, probably to the Athletic clubhouse, will shortly take place. The annual green steeplechase across the mountain will be run on Tuesday next. A NEW TIE It has been claimed that the snowshoes and their tyings can never be improved for tramping, and while there may be truth in one part of the statement, the other practical experience has given a flat and decided contradiction. The new tie suggested by an old snowshoer and one which frequent trials have given the evidence of a thoroughly serviceable and simple device, is a broad strip of leather so cut as to form toe strap and fastening all in one. It is bound at the opening so as to catch the toe while it covers the front part of the foot and fastens at the back by either a buckle or tie. It is a feature and is the best substitute for the thongs without having the trouble of tying and untying which the simplest method has. Leather will not stretch and so it is practicable. In case of a cold foot they can easily be attached and danger of frozen fingers is lessened by the fact that the tie can be adjusted with gloves on equally as well as with the naked hand, with which the present tie has always to be handled. The idea is fine to everyone and having tested it thoroughly the inventor can safely recommend it particularly for long-distance tramps. TOHLIM, IMNIKF, VERY LITTLE SATURDAY MORNING The heavy snowstorm practically suspended sliding on Friday and Saturday. The slides were nearly all denied, but were unoccupied, the tobogganers being in some cases disappointed by finding the hills closed. The cost and trouble of clearing a slide must hardly be appreciated by those who make this a subject for complaint, but there were very few indeed who expected sliding after such a fall of the beautiful. All the slides will likely be running this evening, or notice given to the contrary for such as will remain unopened."

His lecture, however, will be given in a few weeks, and will be duly announced. The Cornwall, January 18. There have been several ice shoves here this winter, and the water has been unusually high in consequence, but not sufficient to cause any uneasiness. However, last night, about midnight, the ice moved again and the water rose very rapidly. Towards morning it flowed over the canal bank, running up the streets to First street, a distance of about 200 yards. The alarm was given about 6 a.m., the fire bell rang, etc., and hundreds of people were aroused and went to see the areas that were flooded. Boats were procured and shoved through the icy water, which was freezing quickly, the thermometer marking several degrees below zero and a terrible snowstorm raging. The Stormont Cotton mill, which is situated between the canal and the river, was completely surrounded with water, the boiler submerged and an immense amount of machinery and stock as well. At the Canada Cotton mill, the woollen mill, Mack's Flour mill, etc., which are at the extreme east end of the city, the rise of water was a little late and the hands had all got to work. The flood burst in the doors, and those employed in the lower stories had to flee for their lives. In the Canada Cotton mill two men were supposed to have been caught by the water in the machinery room, Curtig Deruchie and Frank Bergeron. They went back to look after their tools, and Deruchie got out after great exertions, but Bergeron has not been seen since, and it is feared he has been drowned. All the mills were submerged to a depth of fully fifteen feet, the magnificent weaving room of the Canada cotton mills, the largest in America, being at least a foot deep with water. The quantity of stock in process of manufacture was very large and the loss is tremendous, not to speak of the machinery, much of which is wrecked by the raising of the floors. It is too soon to estimate the damage, but it will run up high into the thousands. In the rear of the town there was also a flood, the water breaking up the creek and inundating the surrounding country for hundreds of yards in every direction. The scenes in the flooded districts were heartrending. Many houses were under water above the second storey, and the unfortunate inmates, being unable to get out, were standing knee-deep in the water. Relief parties were organized, and with the aid of boats and lumber managed to extricate the people and convey them to places of safety. Quite a number of horses and cows were drowned in their stables, there being no time to rescue them. A large proportion of those summarily driven from their homes are laboring people. There will be great distress, particularly as it must be some time before the mills are in full running order again. Steps are being taken to organize relief committees to attend to the most urgent cases. The river itself presents a magnificent sight. The ice is piled up in huge masses, some towering to a height of many feet and glittering like diamonds in the bright sunshine. At 12 noon the water receded, being a foot or more lower than its highest mark, but there is no certainty that another flood may not occur. WHAT THE CABLE HAS TO SAY Terribly Fatal Panic in London Theatre. A BRITISH GUNBOAT WRECKED. Italy to Mediate in Bulgaria. Lord Dillon's Items Laid by the National. London, January 18. A frightful accident happened here this evening. A Hebrew dramatic club gave an entertainment at a theatre in Princess street, Spitalfields, which was attended by about 600 persons, mostly Jews. Someone in the gallery, doubtless for a joke, shouted ""Fire."" The gas was immediately turned off at the under, and a terrible panic ensued. The people rushed in a solid mass for the doors, and numbers were trodden underfoot. When the panic had subsided, it was found that twelve women and five youths had been trampled to death, and many others injured. An American Scandal. London, January 18. George Franklin Anderson, who describes himself as an American solicitor, aged 37 years, and residing at the Hotel Metropole, was charged in the police court today with obtaining large sums of money by fraudulent means from Charles Deakin, of Susquehanna, Pa. Anderson pretended to be engaged in recovering property in England belonging to the ancestors of Deakin, and had succeeded in swindling him out of $20,000. Anderson was remanded. The Bavarian Cabinet. Munich, January 18. Baron Crallshoim, Bavarian minister of foreign affairs, has arrived in Berlin.

Total mileage of wind on the 17th was 512; greatest in one hour 50. Monday's snowstorm was speedily followed by a cold wave, the thermometer dropping from 11 above at 1 p.m. on Monday to 3 below at 3 a.m. yesterday, from which it gradually declined during the day until last midnight it was -17, still going down. This cold was intensified by the strong winds which prevailed, blowing almost all day at an average rate of thirty-five miles per hour. At Midland, Ont., yesterday the thermometer registered -30 below, and very cold weather is reported throughout the West. A River du Loup despatch says: ""A snowstorm set in last night and towards morning a strong northwest wind began to blow, drifting the snow in a terrific storm which still continues. Trains are all cancelled. The accommodation for Levis which should have left at 7:45 this morning is still here and will not leave until the storm abates.

It is rumored that O'Brien yesterday secretly collected rents at Diminish, A Slight fall of the flood Looking After the Household Cars, Cornwall, January 19, Considerable anxiety was felt in Cornwall last night owing to the ice shoving, The night was intensely dark and nothing could be seen, but every now and then the grinding and crushing of the ice was heard, and people were rushing about not knowing how soon another inundation might take place, Those who watched closely, however, saw that the water was gradually receding, and by daylight it had dropped two or three feet, This still leaves a large portion of the town under water, however, and there will have to be a drop of at least ten feet more before the work of gutting the mills in order can be commenced, The people who were turned out of their houses have all been provided for in the meantime, but there will undoubtedly be great destitution, as weeks must elapse under the most favorable circumstances before the mills are again in operation, The mayor and council, with the assistance of private citizens, are looking after the cases most needing assistance, THE SNOWSTORM And How it Affected the Growers' Convention, Fruit The Sherbrooke Line Blocked for Two Days - The Mishaps of the Montreal Contingent - The Other Lines, The Fruit Growers' Association of the Province of Quebec made a new departure this year by holding their annual convention outside of Montreal, This was done in order to induce the farmers to take more interest in the work of the society, many of them being unable to attend the meetings in Montreal, Granby was decided upon, and everything promised well but for the heavy snowstorm which had blocked the road in many parts and rendered Granby as inaccessible as Montreal itself, consequently the attendance was not nearly as large as it would otherwise have been, The Montreal contingent who went out by the 4 p.m. Central Vermont train on Monday had anything but a lively time, Between Montreal and St. Johns the conversation consisted chiefly in speculations as to when and where the train would be snowed up, and as a precautionary measure an investigation was made into the strength of the commissariat department, which only revealed the mournful fact that the total stock consisted of two sandwiches and a few apples. To put a further damper on their feelings the stove went out, bringing the car to about the temperature of a refrigerator, The track was very tough on account of the snow and at Farnham the train was forty minutes late, The stove was again lighted and two-thirds of the journey being covered the spirits of the passengers began to rise in anticipation of a hearty supper in the near future, when suddenly there was a jarring and bumping, and after a few struggles the train came to a standstill about seven miles from Granby, The engineer backed off and made several wild charges at the snow drift, but to no purpose, and finally, all hands had to get out and shovel away the snow, The engine was again attached, and this time succeeded in breaking through, A similar mishap occurred just outside Granby, and more shoveling had to be done, Even the cravings of a healthy appetite did not prevent one from enjoying the picturesque sight, The snow was piled up on each side of the track, and in the dark space between could be seen dimly the forms of men hard at work, the blades of their shovels glittering in the light of the lanterns, and far ahead the engine loomed out of the darkness like some monster awaiting an opportunity to pounce upon its human prey, All else was a dreary waste of snow, But everything has an end and the shoveling was no exception to the rule, The engine being attached succeeded, after a good deal of lugging and straining, in pulling the train through the drift and into the daylight a few minutes before 9 o'clock, The passengers speedily alighted and getting into sleighs were conveyed in all kinds of mysterious directions, through pathways walled on either side by piles of snow to the hotels of which the village boasts two, and here a hot supper, a red hot stove, a cigar and congenial company, made one forget the discomfort through which he had just passed, The meeting, which was held in the Town Hall, was much better attended than was expected, No session was held in the morning, but at the afternoon and evening sessions some valuable and interesting papers were read, Dr."

"18870128","F. Lucas, E. Dunlap, McGill The game was started at 8:25, when Green and Arnton faced. The Ottawas showed good play and Lowe, the goalkeeper, stopped many a fine shot for goals, and after a few minutes from the start the game was taken by the Ottawas, J. Currier putting the puck through; time, 5 min. Things looked blue for the Victorias. The puck was faced again, and the Victorias commenced to wake up, Campbell doing some fine playing with Swift at his back. His dodging was something grand and with good run in front of Ottawa's goals sent the puck through, scoring the first goal for Victoria in 10 minutes. Excitement now ran high, each having taken a game. The puck being faced again it was immediately sent to the Ottawa's goals, but Lowe was ever ready and sent it out of danger, and it was soon returned. Myles, Dey and Green showed good play, as well as Craven, Barlow and Shearer. Swift was doing big play when a well-directed shot by Craven sent the puck through the Ottawa's goals; time, 7 minutes. Half time being called the teams took the usual rest, and some of them were well marked up. The second half was mostly one-sided, the Victorias having it their own way. The Ottawas were getting used up and the Victorias had taken three more goals, Swift taking two and Shearer one. In the second half Green, of the Ottawa, fell and cut himself about the eye and had to leave the ice, and Howe took his place. The playing was very good all through. The playing of Myles, Currier and Lowe, of the Ottawas, and Swift, Campbell, Craven, Arnton, Barlow, Shearer, of the Victorias, was immense. The Ottawas are not used to play in such a large rink, and they owe their defeat to this, as they play in a small rink. Quite a number of their sticks were broken and the Victorias had to lend them some. F. Laimonth as usual officiated in the capacity of referee and everything passed off in good style. The Ottawas were entertained after the match by the Victorias. NOT DISHEARTENED The United States curlers are not all disheartened by their defeat at Toronto, as many of the conditions of playing were novel to them, two-thirds of the match being played on indoor ice, to which our curlers are not accustomed. In the nine rinks that played outside the States curlers had five winners, a good showing against the picked players of Canada. The heavy snowstorm alone prevented the whole match being played on outside ice, as the Canadians were quite ready to meet them on either. The next International bonspiel will be played either on Burlington Bay, Hamilton, or on Lake Erie, at Buffalo, when the players will be on much more equal terms."

The station at Amherst and its approaches were packed with people, who escorted him to the largest hall in the town, where he was presented with addresses from the Liberal-Conservative Association and the Young Men's Association. In acknowledging the honor accorded him, Sir Charles untiringly but touchingly referred to the bond of union that had existed between the people of Cumberland and himself for thirty-three years. The Government, of which he had become a member, deserved the confidence of the people and, he believed, would be overwhelmingly sustained. He would discuss the issues of the campaign in future addresses, but embraced the earliest opportunity to explain his position on the temperance question. He had been a total abstainer for a great many years and would vote for prohibition as soon as ever public sentiment would enforce that law. A public meeting of Mr. Pipes' supporters had been announced for Saturday evening. Sir Charles immediately carried the war into Africa by challenging public discussion. This was finally agreed to by the Oita and Mr. Pipes never made a worse exhibition of himself, Sir Charles making utterly ridiculous the position occupied by his opponents on secession, the sweeping away of the coal and sugar duties, etc."

Owing to the heavy snowstorm and the fact that the telegraph wires were deranged, no definite information could be obtained as to when they would arrive. By and bye the trains began to come in slowly, bringing large numbers of American visitors, but no Rhode Islanders. After waiting in the blinding storm for three hours and a half, the local men were disbanded to meet again about 1 o'clock, and after another hour of waiting the long-looked-for visitors arrived and were received by their Montreal brethren, who were drawn up in line and received them with a general salute. Without any delay a procession was formed in the following order: Vic's band; the local Militant's, followed by the Rhode Islanders, about seventy strong. The route was along St. James, Inspector, Notre Dame streets, through Victoria square, along St. James street, around Place d'Armes, Notre Dame street to the Richelieu hotel.

The wind blew at the rate of sixty-five miles an hour, with gusts of much greater velocity, while the snow descended in sheets of such volume that enjoyment outdoors was a matter of impossibility, walking being almost out of the question, while driving in anything but a covered sleigh was most unpleasant. The roads were very heavy, and the drifts everywhere blocked the way. It most effectually spoiled all outdoor sport, and the visitors for the most part spent their time in the hotels, the corridors and halls being filled with people, while every moment an addition would be made of some more adventurous spirit, who, braving the fury of the storm for a while, was at last forced to turn back beaten. The castle and maze were clothed in a sheet of snow, while every now and then as the wind abated a little the sight of the snow whirling around the turrets of the castle would appear as if the air spirits had assumed form to tear down the bountiful structure. The wind shrieked and whistled through the arches of the building, in railing at times in a way which made anyone of an imaginative turn of mind connect the scene with some legend of a haunted ruin in which the unquiet spirits of many generations mourned over the shattering of the hour of their race. The impression would have been heightened in the evening when the pale glare of the electric lamps shed a ghostly light over the scene, making the walls transparent and throwing the dark shadows of projecting portions far across the snow which lay thick with it. The scene was inexpressibly grand, especially when the silence of the night had turned all thoughts of carnival adrift. It was a mournful sight to any who could pause for a moment in the storm to regard it, representing as it did the lives of many who have stamped their names in the history of the countries of the earth. The centre of attraction for a short period, the admired of all admirers, pale and cold, yet so lovely in its superiority to the general run of things of earth to be in a short while but a faint remembrance, a thing which had served but to charm for a moment. To crowds which left the ball at the Windsor probably poetry never was so far from their minds, as tired and weary, with the very pleasure they courted, they drove homewards. It had been a glorious success and the warmth and comfort of the indoor scene was enhanced by the roar of the wind and the hard hail and snow as it was swept against the window panes. The rinks had their fair share of attendance and the theatres were again forced to turn people away. Yesterday had nothing outdoors except the Driving Park and visit of the Governor-General to the Lansdowne, and with fair weather both can be got off today without interfering with other attractions."

Conservatives and Liberals, French and English, were united, and he had no doubt of a triumphant return on Tuesday evening next. Other addresses were delivered, and the proceedings terminated. THE SNOW BLOCKADE, Trains Delayed, Stuck in the Snow and Cancelled. The severe snowstorm of Saturday yesterday resulted in the almost complete demoralization of the train service of the various railways. The Central Vermont train from Boston and the Delaware & Hudson from New York, due at Bonaventure depot yesterday morning, were two and a half hours late, and the Grand Trunk from the West was over five hours late, the train not arriving until the afternoon. The South Eastern did not arrive at all during the day and was supposed to be stuck somewhere in the White Mountains. The Grand Trunk train for the West left last evening as usual. On the Canadian Pacific railway, the train from Quebec, due at 10 p.m. on Saturday, did not arrive until yesterday morning, and the Ottawa train, due at 9 o'clock on Saturday night was, at latest advice, stuck in a snowdrift near St. Hennas. The Toronto trains, due on Saturday night and yesterday morning, are also somewhere between here and Ottawa. The train for Quebec at 4 p.m. and last evening's train for the West were both cancelled. The opera company which produced The Maid of Belleville at the Academy of Music last week had intended to leave yesterday afternoon for Quebec, but were unable to do so, owing to the train on the Canadian Pacific railway being cancelled. They will leave this morning. Remember that persons having votes in two wards must vote for mayor in the ward in which they reside, and vote for Abbott, H. Cockfield, and Mr. Alf Cuthbert, are due the credit of flagging out the course, and right well did they do their part, it being the general opinion of those who tramped it that it was one of the prettiest ""bee lines"" to Lachine they had ever seen and could not have been made a quarter of a mile shorter even had a civil engineer had the laying of it out. The afternoon threatened to be very stormy, but fortune was kind and shone favorably upon the brave wearer of the tartan tuque, dispelling the snowstorm until evening. At 3 o'clock sharp the shoes were strapped on by the trampers, who were going to start ahead as pioneers to break the way. Although the president had already tramped out to Lachine in the morning with the flags, he was on hand at the appointed hour to lead his club out. The secretary, who has never missed a tramp since the club was organized seven years ago (and says he never wants to either as long as he is able to tramp) was also at his post. Tramping was found to be very good, although a trifle heavy. Some of the lazy men who left about half an hour ahead of the club, under the care of ex-President ""Bill"" Cuthbert, were passed about three miles from Lachine and soon lost sight of altogether, but, needless to say, they turned up in time for supper, having ""only"" taken about three hours for the trip. For the steeplechase, which was started at 4 p.m., there was a large field of entries twenty-three in all sixteen of whom started, including runners from no less than nine clubs, a very representative gathering, indeed. Long before 4 o'clock a crowd of people were seen wending their way to the ""Point,"" and stationing themselves along the Lower road, an expectation to see the start, and to watch the race for the first mile until the runners were lost to view. Mr. McWood, car superintendent of the Grand Trunk railway, the honorary president of the Argyle, acted as starter, and Mr. Win. Bellingham a timekeeper. Shortly after 4 o'clock the men were sent off, Larkin, of the Emerald, leading, closely followed by Wray, Limb, McVotd, Jokers, Turnbull and the remainder of the sixteen. Considerable disappointment was felt at McTaggart, who had entered, not being able to run, as the race between he and Larkin would have been a grand one. When last seen from the road the men were all running in good form, Larkin having a considerable lead on the others and giving promise of maintaining it. In Lachine, as the time approached for some of the contestants to be putting in an appearance, the excitement was intense, members of the various clubs being on hand in force to back their own men. As anticipated Larkin was an easy winner, arriving at Hanna's remarkably good time. The score was: K. IKE. For thirty long years he has ministered to his flock, never well off but now almost destitute. The poor ornaments in his adobe church have not improved by age, and its general nudity within testifies amply to the needy condition of the worshippers. His sexton, once a Mexican mountebank, now turns his musical talents to a boiler use. He is organist and sexton in one and for this combination of accomplishments he is repaid by the sale of coarse blankets which he wears during the week. The pious father himself is a laborer in the Vineyard of the Lord in literal sense, because he maintains himself by the cultivation of grapes and the sale of wine made therefrom with his own hands. With cheerful hospitality he treated us to good white wine of his own brew, and while we drank thereof he told us the story of his work with an air which implied that he was totally unconscious of any peculiar merit connected with it. A passing gleam of hope shone upon him last year when the vacancy of bishop at Santa Fe had to be filled, and it was thought by his friends that he had earned the distinction. But the opportunity went by, and henceforward it would seem as if he must ripen for the grave without further recompense than the serene conviction of having denied himself for noble ends. AN ABSURD SITUATION. Having nothing to look out at but the sterility of the desert, we prepared our minds for the scene of plenty and beauty so soon to astonish us in California by reading the railway folder, in which the glorious aspects of this ""Garden of the World"" are so grandiloquently set forth. And just when our expectations are at their highest, and we have reached the summit of the Sierra Madre mountains, twenty-three miles from San Lorrain, the outer edge of Eden, suddenly we find ourselves in the absurdest of situations. We are stuck fast in a blinding snowstorm, hindered from going either way by landslides on both sides of us caused by the storm. For forty-eight hours we have watched the familiar battering of the snow with a poor prospect of relief. As an aggravation of our wretchedness we are within an hour of sumptuous hotels and abundance of fruit, and still we are thankful to get limited rations of canned corned beef. There is on the part of the fates a refinement of torture, a device worthy of the Inferno in holding a Canadian at the gate of a summer land and pelting him vigorously with snow before admitting him to its glad scene. At any rate more canned beef has arrived, supplemented with canned plums, to mitigate the miseries of our bondage.

Mr. Hass sank down in the snow thoroughly exhausted and unable to proceed. His now frantic wife tried in vain to urge him on, but he was compelled to leave him and seek aid at the nearest home. When she arrived at the house she sought, she found a woman alone. It was about 10 o'clock at night, but taking blankets the two women started back to succor Mr. Hass. He was unconscious when they reached him and with difficulty they succeeded in getting him a few rods further toward shelter. But he was a large, heavy man, and the women were compelled to abandon their efforts in his behalf. Wrapping her shawl around him, and again giving him some nourishment, his noble helpmeet sat down beside him, while her kind assistant started for home. Mrs. Hass remained with her husband until he died, about 8 o'clock in the morning. When help arrived at the scene the unfortunate couple were taken home, one nearly as lifeless as the other. Mr. Hass was nearly seventy years of age, and his faithful wife a few years his junior. LI Mllll!

"18870308","W. Bentley, the Conservative candidate, by a majority over Mr. Pound of 126 votes, THE SNOW BLOCKADE Railway Traffic Still Demoralized Presentation to Obliging Conductors The Condition of the Streets The railway traffic is still slightly demoralized by the recent snowstorm, but some of the American trains managed to get in almost on time, others being delayed. The Grand Trunk Western train was only a little late. The Canadian Pacific Railway Western train, due on Sunday morning, only arrived yesterday afternoon. The Canadian Pacific Railway Quebec train, due last night, was seven hours late and was expected in this morning. The passengers on the Intercolonial railway, coming from Halifax a week ago, had rather an unpleasant experience. The train, after stopping seven hours at Newcastle, N.B., arrived at Quebec eighteen hours late and stopped there three hours while the road was being cleared. A start was finally made, but the train got stuck in a drift between Chaudiere and Craig's road, it having taken twenty-two hours to traverse the fourteen miles from Quebec. There was not a house within three miles of the track, and the passengers had to pass the night on the cars with nothing to eat. Next morning Conductor Dussault tramped back through the snow to Chaudiere, a distance of seven miles, and returned dragging after him a little handsled loaded with provisions, and the passengers, who were now as hungry as hunters, were treated to breakfast. After a good deal of hard work Ste. Lucie was reached at 4 p.m. The Grand Trunk Railway Company had a hot dinner waiting for the passengers here, and when it was partaken of, the train proceeded and arrived here at 10:30 p.m. next day. The trip from Halifax occupied altogether four days. On arriving in Montreal, the passengers presented the following address to the conductors: We, the undersigned, passengers by the Grand Trunk Railway from Point Levis to Montreal, have very much pleasure in testifying our appreciation of the assiduity and attention of Conductors M. Dussault and Ed. Crean and the other train hands during our arduous and tedious journey, resulting from the recent almost unprecedented snowstorms."

We also hear of some large lines being offered at 15c per dozen. There has been a very fair local distribution of butter at steady prices, and stock is being renewed at as satisfactory a rate as could be expected through the local outlet.

The hop market has been and is in a most unsatisfactory state, which borders on complete demoralization, so difficult is it to make sales, and so low are prices. Brewers, who are one and all stocked up, do not figure as buyers at all; in fact, they hold enough stock to carry them into the new crop, at least so it is claimed. This explains their indifference and the extremely low prices which they occasionally bid on offerings. Finest German hops, the first cost of which here was 38c, would now be sold at about 20c. A late cable from Nuremberg quotes that market at 55s, which is equal to 21c here. Duty-paid Canadian hops are extremely dull and low in price, especially as the 1888 crop was of poor quality, and even if a choice bright sample were obtainable, 12c would be an extreme price, while low grades range down to 8c. In New York, quotations are: German 14c-24c; English 15c-18c; state 20c; common to good 15c-16c; and Pacific coast 18c-20c. The New York Commercial Bulletin says: Business is merely of a retail character, and confined mainly to the best appearing foreign hops that may be had for fewest cents per pound. The desirable quality new domestic goods offered are held at prices relatively as much above what good Germans are selling at, that they meet with slow sale, and olds seem to be neglected by brewers. Holders of sales here and in the interior are slow to sell at the prices obtainable and seem to be more or less inclined to hold back pending knowledge as to the conditions of the roots in the hop yards. Trade has been greatly retarded by the heavy snowstorms, which have blocked the railway for the movement of merchandise and rendered the country roads practically impassable. These conditions, therefore, have been against the distribution, which has been of smaller dimensions than would have been the case had better weather prevailed. All lines have been affected by the inconvenience, yet since the opening of this week there has been a better inquiry for maple syrup, which promises at least a fairly active trade when the obstructions have been fully removed. There is no doubt that the advent of more spring-like weather, which cannot now be long delayed, will witness a resumption of activity. The prospects for a good spring trade are excellent; importers have ordered considerable quantities of goods, and consumers throughout the country have evinced a decided desire to buy largely for spring delivery. The manufacturing situation, likewise, has continued healthy, and all industries appear to be in a flourishing condition. The railway earnings for the first nine weeks of the year show an increase of $200,000 on the Grand Trunk and of $121,000 on the Canadian Pacific over the corresponding period of 1888. In fact, the whole business situation over the country, with the exception of the Maritime provinces, where serious disturbances have occurred, has a healthy and promising look. Dry Goods: Bad weather has interfered with the dry goods trade, but under the circumstances, a fair movement has taken place. A large quantity of spring goods has been distributed this season, yet there appears to be no excess of stock carried by country merchants, except in the Belleville section, where travelers report stocks rather heavy. There has been no new feature in the trade, but prices on all fabrics are firm and well maintained, while payments have been as prompt as could be expected. The flour market, hot cut, per keg, $4; dry, hot cut, Am. pat $3; dry, hot cut, per keg, Am. pat $3; fine hot cut, per keg, Am. pat $4; dry, cold cut, per keg $3; cold cut, per keg $3."

"18870317","J. Patterson for member of Parliament. Mr. Desjardins denies the accusation. The accused is about 60 years old and widely known in the county, where he has lived all his life. He has represented West Tilbury in the county council for several years and was elected warden by the council last January. He lives at Strong Point, where he owns a large general store. The difficulties of the canvass in Algoma are thus described by Mr. Dawson: The terrible snowstorms were a great drawback in travelling through the district, and they also prevented hundreds of electors from polling their votes. He felt certain that there would have been a large majority of Conservative votes in many places if the electors could have reached the polling booths. Roads and fences were completely buried by the snow, and in one trip, with a strong team of horses, he was four hours going four miles. The farmers, who were largely friends, could not get out, and the villagers had it principally to themselves. At Kalgawong, where there were 144 votes, they could not drive in, and he was since informed that they intended to vote for him. In another place, the electors met together, appointed a polling clerk, and by open vote gave him a majority of 23. This, of course, was not included in the returns, but it showed all the same the sentiment of the people. The Sault Ste. Marie Pioneer says: There is no doubt that if the Conservatives had presented an unbroken front and well-organized ranks in this contest, they could and would have increased Mr. Dawson's majority to nearly 300. Mismanagement and division have done much towards reducing his majority."

Hides and Skins The hide market has been more active, with a stronger tone, but prices are unchanged, except for Western buff and upper No. 1 and B and No. 3 which have advanced 54c. There is a general impression here that values will advance soon owing to the strong Western market, which will likely affect our market. Sales reported were on one car of Hamilton hides at 8¾c, one car of packers' do at 10¾c, and one car of heavy bull do at 7¾c. A late dispatch from Chicago says that the market for packers' hides is very closely sold up and dealers are asking an advance of 1c, with prospects of a further advance. The receipts have been larger and rather more business has been done at steady prices.

"18870330","THE SNOW BLOCKADE: Unparalleled Depth on the Intercolonial Train at a Standstill Quereo, March 29 The snow blockade on the Intercolonial railway is unprecedented. One train has been one hundred hours covering two miles, and the snow drifts where she now stands completely cover the telegraph poles. The outgoing English mail, which left on Friday, is still stuck between River du Loup and Rimouski, while the incoming English mail and emigrant train will likely have to remain over at St. Flavie. Every effort is being made to have the line cleared, and no expense will be spared. The Canadian Pacific railway cancelled all outgoing trains yesterday and this morning. They will, however, attempt to get a train through at 2:30 this evening. The drifts on this road are very deep, and it is all that mechanical power can do to scatter them. The Lake at John road will be clear this evening. With the great quantity of snow on each side of the roads, the slightest snowstorm with drifting fills up all the cuts and blocks traffic. Men are working night and day. The Grand Trunk railway express was only two hours behind time yesterday and the road today is clear."

This was the same young man as was in the depot afterwards, he had a black bottle of gin with him and wanted us to have a drink. He remained in the car about thirty minutes warming himself at the stove. He spoke like a man who was well educated."" Joseph Iloan, who keeps the hole near the Mile End station, said that the man refused to enter his hole. He asked for hot water, and on getting it he pulled a bottle of gin out of his pocket and put some in. He then asked for sugar, but, continued the hotel keeper, ""Hold him that was not the way I made my money."" He identifies a photograph. Mr. Kriouard Valliere keeps a wholesale grocery shop at the corner of Mount Royal Avenue and St. Lawrence Street, in St. Jean Baptiste village. The same man who called at the depot visited his place. Detective Lapointe showed him the photograph of young Nattier and he said: ""That is the man who called here."" Mr. Louis Valliere, brother of the last named, and Mr. Girard, who keeps a hotel adjoining, saw the photograph and both believed the man who called was the original of the picture. ""If this clue is right, and if the Messrs. Valliere are not mistaken in their identity, the young man is known."" There is no foundation for the theory that he was murdered. It is most improbable. The alternate supposition is that after Murphy saw him leave Vervals' hotel he missed his way, and, getting lost in the snowstorm, perished.

Medium Grade Dull-The Outlook for Home Graziers-Other Hotel On The Trade. (From our own correspondent) Liverpool, March 19. With a shorter supply at Stanley, sellers managed to raise prices nearly ten shillings a head on good cattle, but secondary sorts remained stationary. Over at Birkenhead notwithstanding the small number of States on offer, prices ruled much the same, 10c being the highest point touched for a few extra bodies. For the ordinary run of carcases 9Jc was current, the depression still prevalent in the metropolis affecting speculative tendency. The general opinion is that for a week or two prices will be slightly higher, provided supplies from the States continue on the same moderate scale. So far as Ireland is concerned it is believed that the fat cattle available have been nearly all run off. There are plenty of cattle in England and Scotland yet to carry us through the spring, at the present rate of consumption. Dealers alike find common cause for complaint in the weak demand experienced and are anxiously inquiring about the better times so long promised. LONDON AND DEPTFORD Both on Monday and Tuesday trade was of the same character, the earlier market being interfered with to some extent by the snowstorm, and the later one by the slush and thaw.

THE OUTLOOK FOR HOME GRAZIERS is described by the Live Stock Journal as most unsatisfactory, the recent snowstorm having very materially altered the complexion of affairs for breeders and feeders of stock. The question of keep is becoming a puzzling one, as there is very little grass on the pastures and the root crops are getting exhausted. Serious losses of lambs in various parts of the country are reported as following in the wake of this snowstorm. The whole cattle trade of Scotland is upset by the pleuro-pneumonia pest, and though in England it has not reached a degree by any means alarming, there is just a possibility of its doing so. Canadian shippers will do well to note these facts. There is no immediate necessity for beginning, or attempting to begin shipping. In my opinion the longer they can hold on to the stock the better. They would also do well to keep in view that cattle are more in request every day in Scotland. A company has just been formed in Aberdeen for the purpose of importing Canadian stores, and as its promoters are agriculturists of considerable influence in the country, it is likely to be carried to a successful issue. I have put myself in communication with the secretary and hope to have a detailed prospectus before me shortly. ""PERSONAL,"" Mr."

"18870402","TEA1N Interview with Professor Tanner of England, One of the Passengers-The Prospects of Immigration this Year The Imperial Government and Emigration to Canada The snowbound Intercolonial train arrived in Montreal last evening with the passengers and mails of the Parisian. The trip from Liverpool was rough on sea and on land, but a Gazette reporter learned from several of the passengers last evening that the interval of the snow blockade was a relaxation rather than a wearisome experience for the cabin passengers as well as for the hardy emigrants who are about to make the Dominion their adopted country. Professor Tanner of London, Eng, was among the passengers. The name is identified with Canada as one of the foremost of those who, in the old country, are endeavoring to sway the tide of desirable emigration towards the fertile lands and happy homes of the Northwest. Mr. Tanner is examiner in agriculture to the Government department of science in London, a high position in which his influence must be, and deservedly great in presenting the advantages of settlement in Canada to those who, in the motherland, desire to find fresh fields and pastures new for their capital and their industry. ""Tell me about your trip?"" asked the reporter as a query. ""Our voyage on the Parisian,"" replied Professor Tanner, ""was remarkable because of the unprecedentedly rough weather we experienced on the voyage, which delayed our arrival in Halifax until Monday morning at 3 o'clock. The blockade on the line was an incident of further delay, but it was pleasant rather than disagreeable. At Halifax the cabin passengers were transferred to a special train and we moved on rapidly until we came to St. Flavie, when there was a halt and the officials announced a snow bank in front and no chance of getting through for the present. We were seventy-two hours delayed here, but we found comfortable quarters in the hotel, and the officials and authorities of the railway left nothing undone to minister to our comfort. The immigrants were following in another train, but they were prudently stopped by the railway people at Campbellton, and as I have since learned treated with every kindness and consideration."" ""Is this your first experience of a snowstorm in Canada?"" asked the reporter, hoping to get an original idea as to what an Englishman thought of a three days' delay on the railroad track. ""Well, not the first,"" replied the professor. ""I am an old traveller in Canada, and I got caught similarly in March of last year. A snow blockade is an idea which conveys a feeling of horror to the minds of the majority of old country people, but my experience is different. The emigrants, I am sure, do not feel discomforted by their excellence. The facilities which you have in Canada for contending with such an event are so perfect that all inconvenience is removed."" ""How do you think the newcomers to the country will think about a baptism in such a snowstorm?"" ""I know that they will write home to their friends, telling of the comfort which they found and the rather cheerfulness of the situation. Canadian snow, it seems to me, is more welcome than the wet snow which falls in England. We left the old country in a snowstorm, which whitened our overcoats and depressed our spirits. The contrast with the Canadian snow had an inspiriting effect all round."" THE PROSPECTS OF IMMIGRATION The professor and the reporter then talked about the prospects of emigration from England to Canada during the coming season. The theme wore as roseate a hue as the snow blockade question was white, and both seemed cheerful and congenial subjects to Professor Tanner. ""Have you taken any emigrants out with you this voyage?"" queried the interviewer. ""Yes, I have fifteen in my charge this time, and it is my first practical effort in furthering the colonization of the Dominion. The people who came by the Parisian are an extremely desirable body, and adapted to the requirements for worthy settlers in the Northwest. A large proportion of them were engaged in farming at home; they are in the prime of life and have a fair amount of capital to help them along in their new venture."" ""What are the prospects of emigration from England to Canada this year?"" ""The prospects are perhaps brighter than ever they were before. This is largely due to the fact that the Colonial exposition has advertised the fertility and the industrial greatness of the country. It has established a higher appreciation than ever in the minds of those who will make worthy settlers, and men of capital will be induced to come here."" ""Can you give an opinion on the recent movement in England to encourage emigration from England to the colonies?"" ""A committee of the Peers and Commons has been formed for the purpose of obtaining the best information upon the means whereby emigration may be safely aided by the state to the colonies."" ""Do you favor such a scheme?"" ""Colonization on properly conducted lines from England would be a benefit not only to the colonies but to the motherland. I have already spoken to a number of members of this committee and I feel assured that they are in favor of the idea of emigration. Canada is the favorite colony in England and the result of the movement will be, I believe, to send out the most desirable class of emigrants to this country."" The interview then ended. Professor Tanner is en route to the Northwest."
"18870404","THE WEATHER An Extract from the Report of Mr. Gauthier, of the Fire Alarm Department The following is an extract from the weather report of Mr. Gauthier, of the Fire Alarm Department: The mean temperature for the month was 4 degrees colder than the same month last year. The temperature was uniformly cold with very few exceptions, with heavy falls of snow and high winds, making the streets almost impassable to sleighs. The barometer varied a good deal during the month. There was slight rain on the 6th and the 18th. There were snowstorms on nine days and high winds on ten days; the highest wind was on the 23rd and 25th, when it was blowing 60 miles an hour, and on the 30th, when it was 30 miles. The coldest days were the 1st and 5th, when the temperature was 2 and 12 degrees below zero respectively, and the warmest days 18th, 19th and 20th, when it was 40, 45 and 40 above zero. The mean thermometer for the month was 21.84; the hygrometer, 42.04; the barometer, 29.11352, and the mean velocity of the wind, 11.01. The following is a comparison of the average temperatures between the three months and the same period last year: 1886, 1887 January 13.67, 7.97 February 7.72, 13.08 March 14.36, 21. A. Allan, whose name, in spite of his wish to keep it secret, was soon known, has the hearty thanks of the club. The matches played during the past year were as follows: May 15th, versus Ottawa College, played in Ottawa. This was the most unfair match the club has ever played, our opponents repeatedly fouling and violating the rules; in addition to which the referee gave the game against us, which decision was, however, reversed on our protesting and referring the matter to the Canadian Rugby Union. Challenge Cup May 22nd, versus Britannias. Won by 19 points to 6. This was one of the easiest victories the club has ever had over its old opponents, though our scrimmage was much below its usual form. October 9th, versus Ottawa, played in Ottawa. This was a pleasant and well contested game. Won by 9 points to 1. October 23rd, versus Britannias. Won by 7 points to 5. This was the first of the provincial championship series, and was the most evenly contested match of the season, owing in a great measure to the weakness of our scrimmage. Our backs, however, saved us the day. October 30th, versus McGill. Won by 20 points to 1; the second and final in the provincial championship series. In this game our scrimmage worked much better, materially assisting in making the victory an easy one. November 13th, versus Kingston Cadets. Won by 18 points to 1. An easy victory. November 6th, versus Britannias. Lost by 13 points to 5 in one hour's play. This was the only defeat suffered by the first fifteen last year, and was caused, not by the inferiority of our team, but partially by the fact that we repeated a former mistake and undervalued our opponents, and partially because we played in a snowstorm against a strong wind during one half and in four inches of snow, so that practically the result was no criterion of the game. Our second fifteen matches were as follows: May 8, versus Britannia. Lost by 7 points to 3. October 27, versus Garrison Artillery. Won by 40 points to nothing. October 30, versus Britannias. Won by 12 points to 1. This was a good match and showed plainly the vast improvement in our second. The third fifteen only played one match, viz., November 6, versus Britannia. A drawn game, 4 points to 4. The association team also played but one match, viz., March 8, versus Britannias, winning by 2 goals to nothing. The Branch of the club was very unfortunate in its match arrangements, due in a great measure to their lack of organization. The club thus played seven first fifteen matches winning six and losing one, three second fifteen matches winning two and losing one, one third fifteen match a drawn game, and one association match, winning. The annual dinner was held at Hall & Scott's and was the most successful one the club has ever had. In conclusion I wish to say that the successful career of the club during the past three years has been largely owing to our captain, Mr."
"18870405","THEMIS IN STUDENT Humors and Possibilities What is Talked About the Mystery by Citizens A rumor was prevalent in the city last evening to the effect that the missing student had turned up alive at Longueuil. The report was originated by a carter on Place d'Amies Square stand, who told his fellow carters that the mayor of Longueuil had paid him $5 to drive the missing man to Montreal. Enquiries by a Gazette reporter last evening could not confirm the statement of the carter and the conclusion is that the report was a canard. The relatives of young Hauler have, it appears, employed a private detective to hunt up the case. This ought to make detective work more lively for men who claim to know their business. There is no reason why the city detectives, who have worked so energetically for the past ten days should give up the case, although it is suggested that they consider their mission ended in view of the intrusion. The best man win? Let Chief Detective Cullen, Lapointe and their confreres take the prize. Here are a few theories about the case which are generally discussed by citizens. Suppose the unfortunate young man got lost in a snowstorm of the fatal night; the thaw of the past few days ought to reveal the body. Young Hauler undoubtedly had money on his person when last seen. Suppose the body should be found and no money in the pockets of the clothes, are not the circumstances suspicious? What course should the detectives then take? Those possibilities are talked about by citizens, and the detectives are looked upon to elucidate the mystery. Yesterday morning Detective Lapointe prosecuted his search for Hauler, the missing student, but without success. He also made enquiries about the men who found the overcoat and found that they were respectable, hard-working men, who had been employed by Mr. Hanna and Mr. Bureau for the past three years. Detective Lapointe is confident that the body will be found near where the coat was discovered in the course of a few days, after the thaw has melted some of the snow away.

Holt read a very interesting paper on the period of Canadian history from 1760 to 1784 before the Society for Historical Studies Thursday evening. In the course of his paper Mr. Holt said: Upon the signing of the articles of capitulation at Montreal, 8th September, 1760, General Amherst, as commander of the English army, became governor-general of Canada. He divided the country into three districts corresponding with the old divisions. Murray was placed as governor at Quebec, Burton at Three Rivers, and Gage at Montreal. Murray at Quebec established a military council, composed of seven army officers to dispose of the more important civil and criminal cases. This council sat twice a week. Murray reserved the less important cases for his own decision, or that of the officers commanding the different posts throughout the country. Gage at Montreal was somewhat milder in his administration. He allowed the citoyen de paroisse to decide local disputes, with right of appeal to the military commandant or to himself. Later he divided his jurisdiction into five districts, in each of which he formed military courts of justice of at most seven and at least five militia officers, sitting every fifteen days and drawn, according to the locality, from one of three councils of war, which he established at Montreal, Varennes and St. Sulpice respectively. From one of these courts there was appeal to him, and with him too, rested the power of ratifying or reversing all criminal sentences. The Canadians through their militia officers thus took part in the administration of justice at Montreal, at Quebec and at Three Rivers; they were represented at the Military council by two Canadian lawyers, appointed attorneys-general. Garneau complains bitterly and with some justice of this military regime a violation of the articles of capitulation which guaranteed the Canadians the rights and privileges of British subjects; but although not a pleasant experience, it was doubtless at that time the best that could be given to Canada. The French-Canadians, never at any time accustomed to a voice in their own Government, were not unhappy under it. The system of hard cash, introduced by the British, was in favorable contrast to Bigot's paper money, repudiated by the French court, and went far to reconcile them to the administration. This military rule lasted from 1760 to 1771. The French Canadians had hopes of a restoration to France up to 1763; the treaty of Paris in that year irrevocably identified them with Great Britain. By this treaty, France assented to the cession of all her possessions in North America, with the exception of the Islands of Miquelon and St. Pierre, which she yet keeps as stations for her vessels fishing on the banks of Newfoundland. The French-Canadians retained possession of their homes and property, and were to enjoy the free exercise of their religion, and have all the civil and commercial rights of British subjects. All who had been engaged in the war were granted free pardon, and the Indians friendly to the French left undisturbed in the possession of their lands. Murray now became Governor-General, replacing Sir Jeffry Amherst, established a new council, entrusted himself with the legislative, executive and judiciary powers, lacking only the right to tax. The council was composed of lieutenant-governors of Montreal and Three Rivers, of the Chief Justice, the Inspector of Customs, and of eight persons chosen from among the most prominent in the colony. The country was divided into three districts, two tribunals. The Court of King's Bench and the Court of Common Pleas were established, modeled upon those in England, and empowered to enforce the laws of England, except in cases pending before 1st October, 1764. The judges were appointed by the majority of the governors' council, subject to approval at home; and there was an appeal from their decision to the council, and from the council to the Privy Council in England. The council promulgated a number of ordinances regulating exchange, obliging proprietors to register the original titles of their property, prohibiting exit from the colony without passport; fixing the age of majority at twenty-one, and defining the crime of treason and felony. Sir Francis Norton and Sir W. DeGrey, the Crown lawyers, were consulted a couple of years later, as to whether under the treaty of 1763 the Canadians were subject to the laws passed in England against Roman Catholics, and they gave an opinion in the negative. In the beginning of 1763 the Indian chief Pontiac, with several tribes, very nearly succeeded in carrying out a scheme to recapture the frontier forts from the English. Seven forts were taken, and the inhabitants killed or made prisoners. Detroit, Niagara, and Pittsburg resisted the savage attacks. The conspiracy was quelled in the following year, and Pontiac fled. His schemes were brought to naught, but they left a rich and romantic field for the historian; an opportunity which the brilliant Parkman has not failed to profit by. The administration of the council gave general dissatisfaction. The French understood neither the language nor the justice of English law. In 1766 the Hon. Guy Carleton succeeded General Murray. He was a sincere friend of the French-Canadians, and it was through his recommendation that the British Parliament finally passed after several years of procrastination the act of 1774. The Quebec Act. By this act the boundaries of the province were made to include Labrador to the east, the settlements in the Ohio valley to the southwest, and all the country to the north, as far as Hudson Bay territory. It permitted the French-Canadians to hold office in the colony, and established the French civil law, with the addition of the liberty to leave all kinds of property by will, but declared that English criminal law was still to be enforced. The governor was to appoint a council of not less than seventeen, nor more than twenty-five, to be composed of both French and English colonists, Catholic or Protestant. Those were to make the necessary laws, subject to approval in England. They had, however, no right to impose taxes other than those for the preservation of roads and public buildings. The bill passed the House of Lords by unanimous vote, but the opposition in the Commons was most determined, the debate lasting several days. The London merchants, excited by their transatlantic countrymen, presented remonstrances and retained a barrister to appear and plead before the Bar of the House. Governor Carleton, Chief Justice Hey, and Messrs. Da Lothbiniere, Moseres and Marriott were examined as witnesses. When the bill finally passed the London merchants and later the Protestants in the colony petitioned the King against it without effect. The congress of the twelve dissatisfied states, meeting at that time at Philadelphia, placed among their grievances this Quebec Act, which they claimed recognized the Catholic religion, abolished the equitable system of the English laws and established in Canada civil and ecclesiastical tyranny to the great danger of the neighboring provinces. We cannot help being astonished, they said, that the British Parliament should consent to give legal existence to a religion which has flooded England with blood and spread hypocrisy, persecution, murder and revolt throughout all parts of the world. This declaration doubtless lost Canada to the cause of the Confederation. Although the Congress afterwards addressed the Canadians, inviting them warmly to join with them in their struggle for freedom, they never succeeded in destroying the effect of this injudicious declaration of antagonism to the Roman Catholic religion. The clergy and the nobles had become inviolably attached to England by the confirmation of the seignorial tenure and of the tithes system, two institutions which they could not hope to see survive such a revolution. The French tradesmen, poor and few in number, followed them. Even had the Canadians not been offended, says Garneau, by the declaration of Congress against the Catholic religion and the French laws, they always preserved in their hearts that hatred of all the English, whoever they might be, which they had contracted in their long wars; and they confused in their minds the English in Canada with those of neighboring states; they saw in both the same race of turbulent and ambitious tyrants. The country people showed more sympathy with the Americans; they declared at first that they would not bear arms against them; that they would remain neutral. A sudden invasion, however, in September, 1775, decided them against this course. Ticonderoga, Crown Point, St. John, Chambly, Montreal, Sorel and Three Rivers were successively occupied by the Americans under Montgomery. The fort at St. Johns surrendered on the 3rd of November after a gallant defense the garrison marching out with the honors of war. Crown Point also surrendered. Montreal, which was entirely defenseless, capitulated on the 12th November, and Gen. Carleton, conceiving it of the utmost importance to reach Quebec, the only place capable of defense, passed through the American force stationed at Sorel, in a canoe with muffled paddles, during the night, and arrived in Quebec on the 19th. One Capt. Bouichette contrived the escape of the Governor Timothée TUB AMERICAN LINES dressed as a peasant. While thus threatened from the side of Montreal a new danger to Quebec presented itself from an entirely unexpected quarter. An expedition headed by Col. Arnold, an officer in the service of Congress, and consisting of two regiments amounting to about 1,100 men, left Boston about the middle of September and undertook to penetrate through the wilderness to Point Levis, by means of the rivers Kennebec and Chaudière. After enduring great privations and hardship, on one occasion being compelled to kill their dogs for sustenance, and after passing thirty-two days in the wilderness, they arrived on the 4th November at the first settlement, Sertigan, twenty-five leagues from Quebec, where they obtained provisions. On the 6th they arrived at Point Levis, where they remained twenty-four hours before it was known at Quebec. The following day, late in the evening, they crossed the river in thirty-four canoes, and succeeded in landing 500 strong at Wolfe's cove, just above the city. Arnold's force, however, was too small to attempt to reduce the fortress, until Montgomery's arrival from Montreal, on the 1st of December. There were at that time 1,800 men in the Citadel under Carleton. A siege, or rather a blockade, was maintained the whole month of December. The Americans were established in every house near the wall, and their riflemen in excellent cover kept up an unremitting fire upon the British sentries. Despairing of reducing the place by a regular siege, Montgomery resolved on a night attack. In this design he was encouraged by Arnold, whose local knowledge was accurate, having been acquired in his frequent visits to Quebec for the purpose of buying up Canadian horses. The attack was made on the morning of the 31st of December in the midst of a blinding snowstorm, and resulted in the wounding of Arnold and the death of Montgomery. The garrison had been prepared and received the Americans with furious charges of grape and musket balls, cutting them to pieces. When the news of this defeat reached Congress, they appointed three commissioners to go to Montreal, confer with Arnold and arrange a plan for the rectification of Canadian affairs. Benjamin Franklin and two others were accepted for this mission. They were clothed with extraordinary power, being authorized to receive Canada into the union of colonies and organize a government on the republican system. They were empowered to suspend military officers, decide disputes between the civil and military authorities and vote at councils of war, draw upon Congress to the amount of £100,000, raise additional troops and issue military commissions. In short, whatever authority Congress itself could be supposed to exercise over Canada was conferred upon the three commissioners. They were charged to convince, conciliate and win the Canadians by appeals to their reason and interest, in aid of which they were to take measures for establishing a newspaper to be conducted by a friend of Congress. The first dispatch of the commissioners informed Congress that Canada was lost, that their credit was not merely impaired, but destroyed. On the 28th May they left Montreal to attend a council of war at Chambly, where it was determined that the army should evacuate. Thus ended the efforts of Congress to maintain a footing in Canada. In 1776 Gen. Galdimand became Governor. Interested in the heroic sacrifices of the United Empire Loyalists, he, in 1784, caused the country west of the Ottawa to be surveyed, and here the British Government distributed large grants of land among the loyalists as well as along the lower St. Lawrence and Bay of Quinte. These settlers laid the foundations of the provinces of Ontario and New Brunswick. After the paper had been read a discussion took place on several questions touched upon by the essayist, who was complimented on his comprehensive treatment of the subject. Mr. Henry Mott, in speaking of the visit of Franklin, Chase and Carroll to Montreal, said that if those delegates of Congress did not remain themselves they left their printer behind them, and as proof of the fact he exhibited the earliest book published in this city, the ""Reglement de la Confierle de l'Adoration Perpetuelle du Sacrement, et de la Bonne Mort,"" bearing on its title page the names of F. Mosptet and C. Berger, imprimeurs et libraires, pros le Marche, 1770. Two years later Mesplet founded this journal. Mr. Mott also read a poem by Ebenezer Elliott, entitled ""Miran-Ion,"" treating of the fall of Quebec and the death of Wolfe. The next paper Canada, 1784-1812 will be read by Mr. Kerry, on the 20th inst."

"18870429","THE QUEEN'S COUNTY CASE The conduct of the returning officer in Queen's County, New Brunswick, in declaring Mr. Baird, the candidate who received a minority of the votes cast, elected, has brought upon that gentleman and the Conservative party of the county the condemnation of the Liberal press. It would be as well for that press to drop the pretense of solicitation for the rights of the electors in its vigorous denunciation of the returning officer for Queen's, while in the cases of East Bruce and South Victoria the defeated Liberal candidates are endeavoring to secure seats from which they were excluded by the majority of the voters, and to remember that, on purely party grounds and party precedents, it does not rest with it to attack the Conservative party. Questions of this character ought not to be approached in a partisan spirit; they transcend in importance mere party squabbles, and in their determination affect too nearly the rights of the people and the proper conduct of elections, to be treated in other than a judicial manner. As it seems to us, the Commons ought not lightly to undertake the righting of any injustice in such a case as this, if injustice has been done. Parliament has relegated to the courts the trial of contested elections, and in late years, both in Great Britain and in Canada, Parliament has been careful to leave to the tribunal of the judges the investigation and the decision of controverted elections. Indeed, it has been held in England that Parliament can intervene only in the case of members returned in respect of whose qualification it has retained to itself the determination. The last case referred to the Committee of Privileges and Elections of the Canadian Commons was without the jurisdiction of the courts, that of King's, Prince Edward Island, in which a double return was made by the returning officer, and Parliament thus became properly seized of the case and compelled to pass upon it. However, if the Queen's County case is to be dealt with, it is right that a ruling should not be hastily made, but that the Committee of Privileges and Elections should be required to examine into all its bearings before either confirming Mr. Baird in the seat or giving the representation to his opponent, Mr. King. The mere fact that Mr. King had a majority of the votes cast is not necessarily a reason for his return, nor would his exclusion from the seat under that circumstance necessarily be an infringement of the rights of the electors of the county, for the law expressly provides that in certain cases all votes cast for a candidate shall be rejected, even though they constitute a majority of the vote polled, and the seat given to the minority candidate. Whether the candidature of Mr. King, the manner of his nomination, falls within this class, is one of the main points in dispute. Section 22 of the Dominion Elections Act provides as follows: ""No nomination paper shall be valid and acted upon by the returning officer unless it is accompanied by the consent in writing of the person therein nominated, except when such person is absent from the province in which the election is to be held, in which case such absence shall be stated in the nomination paper; and unless a sum of two hundred dollars is deposited in the hands of the returning officer at the time the nomination paper is filed with him, and the receipt of the returning officer shall in every case be sufficient evidence of the production of the nomination paper, of the consent of the candidate and of the payment herein mentioned."" (2) The sum so deposited by any candidate shall be returned to him in the event of his being elected or of his obtaining a number of votes at least equal to one-half the number of votes polled in favor of the candidate elected shall belong to Her Majesty for the names of candidates were then posted throughout the county. On Saturday, February 26th, the day appointed by notice for declaration, I opened court, but on account of the boxes for several parishes being delayed by snowstorm, I adjourned until March 6th. On Saturday, March 5th, I opened court for declaration, and summed up the votes given for each candidate. Lemuel A. Currey, barrister at law, on behalf of Mr. Baird, asked that all the ballots cast for Mr. King be rejected, since Mr. King's nomination paper was invalid on two grounds: First, that the names of the nominees had not been recited in the affidavit to nomination paper; second, that the deposit made with Mr. King's nomination paper had not been legally made, since it was not made by his election agent. After hearing the arguments made on behalf of Mr. Baird, by L. A. Currey, and on behalf of Mr. King, by George F. Gregory, barrister at law, I overruled the first objection to the nomination paper on the ground that it was covered by section 80 of the Dominion Elections Act. I sustained the second objection and declared the nomination paper of George G. King invalid, and that all votes cast for him were void and null. I then declared George F. Baird, of the city of St. John, in the city and county of St. John, barrister at law, elected to represent the electoral district of Queen's, in the House of Commons of Canada, and adjourned the court sine die. There seems to be absolutely no room for doubt that the returning officer would have acted legally, would have performed the plain duty imposed upon him by the law had he, on February 15, rejected the nomination paper of Mr. King, and declared Mr. Baird elected. Whether his failure to do so until after a poll had been taken and the votes summed up alters the case is another question very pertinent to its decision, but it is a question more properly for the courts than for Commons to deal with, and to the former tribunal the case ought, in our judgment, to have been taken. FOR THE IMPORTATION OF BUTTER An analysis of the imports of butter into Canada somewhat modifies the view that under the prohibition of oleomargarine, butterine and other substitutes, the practice of bringing in these latter under the guise of butter has prevailed. About one-half the quantity entered for consumption in Ontario and Manitoba comes in via Hudson's Bay from Great Britain, at York Factory and Moose Factory, the former being under a Manitoba survey and the latter under an Ontario survey. The importation for consumption has been of irregular quantity. Much the greater portion is brought into British Columbia, a market the butter of the Eastern provinces does not yet reach; in fact, outside this province the quantity entered for consumption has never been large. For instance, out of a total import for consumption in 1884 of 281,728 pounds, no less than 273,043 pounds was to the Pacific province; in 1885 it was 32,117 pounds out of 344,431 pounds, and in 1886 it was 201,247 pounds out of 323,830 pounds. Into Ontario and Quebec the importation for consumption has thus varied: otherwise it public uses of Canada. And section 118 provides that ""No payment (except in respect of the personal expenses of a candidate) and no advance, loan or deposit, shall be made by or on behalf of any candidate at any election, before or during or after such election, on account of such election, otherwise than through an agent or agents, whose name or names, address or addresses, have been declared in writing to the returning officer, on or before the nomination day, and any person who makes any such payment, advance, loan or deposit otherwise than through such agent or agents, is guilty of a misdemeanor."" Taking these clauses together, the plain intention of the law seems to be that no nomination paper shall be valid or acted upon unless (1) the sum of two hundred dollars is deposited in the hands of the returning officer at the time the nomination paper is filed with him, and (2) such deposit is made through an agent or agents whose name has been declared in writing to the returning officer on or before the nomination day. Now what were the facts in this Queen's County case? They are thus set forth in the report of the returning officer to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery: On February 14th, Lemuel Currey deposited with the nomination paper of George F. Baird, of the city of St. John, in the city and county of St. John, barrister-at-law, with the required deposit and his appointment as Mr. Baird's election agent. On February 16th, at 11 o'clock, I opened court for nomination of candidates for the House of Commons of Canada."

FAMINE AND MISERY Reported by Icelandic Immigrants to East In their native Land Another Large Batch Expected Shortly Quebec, July 13 Mr. Baldwinson, interpreter for the Icelanders who arrived here per the SS Norwegian and left yesterday for their colony in the Northwest, says they left Iceland for Canada, stopping at Glasgow, Scotland, where the passengers changed their money on the 19th day of June and arrived in this port yesterday evening at 7 o'clock, making the passage from Iceland to Quebec in the short time of twenty-three days. The trip was very pleasant, every person enjoying the best of health. Great distress prevails in Iceland owing to the failure of the grass crops, as only grass can grow in that country. Potatoes will not grow in Iceland. He said I was only able to bring the present immigrants out to Canada with me, they being the only lot able to raise the money to pay their passage, which is $35. The distress in Iceland for the past four years has been terrible, and for the most part unknown to the world, owing to the continued failure of the grass crop livestock has been diminishing from want of food, and to cap the climax of their distress severe snowstorm set in all over that country on the 19th of May last, and continued until the 24th of the same month. The storm was so violent and the fall of snow so great that the pines were actually buried, not to speak of the thousands of sheep and cattle that were also buried alive. When I left the north of Iceland, where I had been detained for ten days in the ice shortly before coming to this country, scores of the inhabitants had been buried alive under the snow. Continuing, Mr. Baldwinson said: The Icelanders make the best of settlers. They are an industrious, sober and thrifty class. The poor race are in great distress at present, as their only means of a livelihood is the raising of livestock, their market being Great Britain. The unfortunate people have at present very little to dispose of, however. They are a very kindly disposed people and take matters as they come without murmur. When they settle in a new country they are very charitable to their own countrymen, and ever ready to extend them a helping hand. When this lot reaches Manitoba the Icelanders, who are there already settled, will share their house room with the new arrivals and even extend them monetary assistance. Iceland is a little larger than Ireland, and has a population of 70,000 souls. The people profess the Lutheran religion and are a very devout and honest race. Mr. Baldwinson said that thousands of the Icelanders would willingly emigrate to this country if they only had the means of doing so. He expects another batch, numbering 700, to come to Canada in about two weeks' time.

A continuance of the case was asked for and granted. Hicks gave bonds of $40,000 to appear before the commission on October 24. He returned to Stafford. Forest Fires Again, San Francisco, October 12 - For four days forest fires have been raging in Sonoma, Alameda, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, all in the vicinity of the Bay of San Francisco. In Alameda thirteen miles have been swept clear. Several fine farms have been completely destroyed. The ground is covered with carcasses of all kinds of dead animals. In San Mateo several bridges and shingle mills have been leveled to the ground. In Santa Cruz two box mills have been destroyed, and thousands of cords of wood have been consumed. From Sonoma comes the worst report: The flames have traveled ten miles in the past twenty-four hours, and devastated everything in their path. Many families are homeless. John M. Ward, shortstop of the New York Baseball club and former captain of the nine, was married to Miss Helen Danvray, the actress, yesterday. The ceremony was private. The couple have gone on a tour to the West. MOROCCO'S AILMENT Not Coinciding with the Just Yet European Intervention Probably Postponed, London, October 12 A Tangiers dispatch says the grand vizier, last evening sent a report to the foreign minister from Marquiness to indicate that the Sultan's health continued to improve and that he was able to leave his room for a short time daily to hold interviews with his ministers. It is reported that 5,000 troops will be concentrated at Tafilalet and be held in readiness for immediate action in case events in Morocco render their services necessary. France and Italy have accepted Spain's invitation to hold a conference in Madrid on the Morocco question. It is expected England will participate. The Paris Journal de Débats says France does not desire to take possession of Morocco; nor to do injury to the material interests of Spain. Moorish waters will soon witness an assembling of men-of-war of all countries, in which even America will be represented. The precise object of this assemblage is unknown, and it is possible that the participants are actuated by widely divergent intentions. If the object is to guarantee the equilibrium of the Mediterranean, the programme is extremely vague and very dangerous. France and Spain, who also have direct and positive interests there, the chief of which is to prevent Morocco from becoming a second Bulgaria, should establish a mutual understanding. The Journal expresses a hope that the Sultan will recover and that the men-of-war will leave, which will be the best thing that can happen for Morocco. THE PHILADELPHIA ORDEAL Probability that the Number of Lives Lost will Never be Known An Appalling Scene, he did not wish to be confined in prison previous to his trial. Gen. Boulanger, in an interview, denied any complicity in the Caftarel affair, and challenged the most searching investigation. He deplores the scandal as likely to have a depressing effect upon the country just when a revival of patriotism is taking place. He believes that Madame Limonson was sent to him from two different quarters in order to lay a trap for him. A lady belonging to a high family has been arrested on a charge of being implicated in the Caftarel scandal. The police found some burned papers in Count D'Acd-Hd's house, and a warrant has been issued for the count's arrest. It is reported that he has committed suicide. It is semi-officially denied that Premier Rouvier has interfered in the Caftarel affair. The statements of La France that M. Rouvier tried to compromise Gen. Boulanger and others in order to bring about the resignation of President Grevy are declared to be malicious inventions. The Government, it is stated, will leave absolute liberty of action to the judicial authorities. Russians at Herat, Cabul, October 12 Three hundred Russian subjects under Syed Yakoob Ali entered Herat in the guise of merchants. The governor, distrusting the object of their visit, communicated with the Ameer, who ordered the governor to refer to Mirahmea Khan, the Russian governor of Murghab, whose reply is anxiously awaited. Elaborate military precautions are being taken at Herat. Trees are being removed and the canal and ditch are being joined in one. A Serious Riot, Sofia, October 12 A riot that almost culminated in a revolt occurred at Rutlevilza on Sunday. A newly arrived Russian priest led a party of peasants in an attack upon the Government offices. The gendarmes fired upon the mob, but it was found necessary to call out a body of cavalry to disperse the rioters. Many were injured. The Soudan Rebels, Cairo, October 12 An official dispatch announces that there are 5,000 rebels with seven guns at Sarras. It is believed the rebels intend to surround Wady Haifa and sever all means of communication. - A jowb Uku fJortaiB-ij, Teheran, October 12 The statement is confirmed that Ayoub Khan perished in the desert. His death resulted from wounds received in the recent battle with the Ameer's troops. Winter Comes Early, London, October 12 Snowstorms, accompanied by thunder and lightning, have prevailed in England and Wales. The roads in Wales are blocked with snow.

It consists of cunningly wrought bands of bead-decorated from which shriveled human fingers, with tips stained a dull ochre color. The necklace was the property of a Sioux medicine man, and it is understood that each finger was cut from the hand of a different victim. Backache wearing one Belladonna Backache Plaster is almost immediately relieved by a couple of these Backache Plasters. The Knights of Labor, Minneapolis, October 12 The convention of the Knights of Labor met in secret session this morning and examined the reports of the committees. The legislative committee's report approving the Blair educational bill, the eight-hour day for mail carriers, the Foran bill in relation to homesteads and providing that such settlers may borrow funds from the Government, secured by the land, at 3 percent, demanding that the Government building contracts provide for weekly payment of working men, and approving the recommendations by the General Master Workman's address in favor of Government control of the telegraph and telephone system of the country, was adopted."
"18871024","Total accumulation of wind on the storm was noted; snowfall in one hour reached two inches winter's warning. The first snowstorm of the season came along last night, and made things decidedly unpleasant. Later on, the wind died away, and the snow changed to drizzling rain. Ottawa, October 23 The first flurry of snow fell this afternoon, and tonight we have had quite a heavy fall for this time of the year, but it is not cold enough for the snow to lie long. Dunning, IA, October 22 There is a driving blustering snowstorm here today with the mercury very low. The storm is moving eastward. Quebec, October 23 A heavy snowstorm is in progress here. Reports to the Signal Service Bureau report heavy snowfalls as far east as Martin River. Winnipeg, October 23 There was quite a fall of snow in the city early this morning, and the same is reported from various provincial points. The weekly statement of the United States Treasurer shows $26,171,128 in the treasury. The presidential party returned to Washington, after the Western and Southern trip, on Saturday.

"18871028","M. Faticher's recital was a charming rehearsal of the main incidents. The Chairman thought there would be no difficulty in raising a loan in England at 31 percent. He understood from the gentlemen they had consulted that permanent investment was very plentiful in England. Sir George Stephen and Mr. McIntyre thought the people there would be only too glad to make the change. If they wanted to place the city as it should be, they would have to spend $200,000 more on the roads next year. The money saved would only provide for one department, and besides this, there was more wanted for the water, police, and other departments. They would have to apply to the Legislature at its next session to abolish exemption from taxation; they could not expect to get this all at once, but they must persevere and they would get it in time. Then the taxation of Montreal was less than that of any other city on the continent, and he did not see why it should be. In some places, property was assessed at only one-third of its value. He had received a letter from a citizen saying that in the whiskey part of the city, if the people were friends of the aldermen, they were assessed at only one-third of the real value. This, he might state, was altogether incorrect, as the aldermen had nothing to do with the valuation, which was done by the assessors, who were sworn to do their duty faithfully. At the same time, he knew a gentleman whose property was assessed for $8,000, and when the Canadian Pacific Railway wanted to buy it, he asked $24,000 for it. He was in favor of raising the revenue by increased taxation. The rate should be fixed at 1 percent, and he believed they had a right to do this for some time at any rate, and as a business man he would say that the business taxes should be increased all round. They were getting near the end of the civic year, and if necessary, he would call the board together twice a week till the new year in order to give them full opportunity to discuss the matter, but whatever was done they must remedy the present disgraceful state of the city. The Mayor entirely concurred with what Alderman Vinen said, and had no doubt the debt could be consolidated and the city would pay much less than at present for interest. By this means, they could get additional revenue without increasing the annual burden. The trunk railway had adopted this plan and he understood the Federal Government was in favor of it. Richard Montgomery's successful life was traced through the adventures of his happy marriage with the Knickerbocker family of the Livingstones, his first military feats, and kept well in view the man. A lugubrious future was the reading of a number of letters to his wife, which Montgomery wrote from old Fort Kt. Johns on the Richelieu, wherein his heart yearned for the peace and quietude of his Rhinebeck home. The nature of Montreal, the descent to Quebec, the junction with Arnold, just crossed from the heights of Levi, after his extraordinary march through Maine and along the Kennebec, were all touched upon with easy grace and felicity, while the description of old Quebec rising from her slumber and thundering from all her batteries when, during the terrible snowstorm of December 31, 1770, Montgomery moved against the masked guns of Presqu'ile and Arnold fought his way up Sault-au-Matelot street, to meet at the foot of Mountain Hill, forced Prescott Gate and wrench the historic capital from the grasp of Carleton, was given with all the skill of the trained man of letters and all the vivacity of the soldier. The end of the momentous campaign was then summed up and the transportation of Montgomery's remains to New York in 1815 was briefly recounted in a few graceful and appropriate words. M. Hamon, of the seminary and President of the Cercle, complimented the gifted lecturer on his essay, and the applause showed how much that compliment was deserved. Don't let that cold of yours run on. You think it a light thing, but it may run into catarrh or into pneumonia or consumption. Catarrh is disgusting, pneumonia is dangerous, consumption is death itself. The breathing apparatus must be kept healthy and clear of all obstruction and offensive matter; otherwise, there is trouble ahead. All the diseases of these parts, head, nose, throat, bronchial tubes, and lungs, can be delightfully and entirely cured by the use of Boschee's German Syrup. If you don't know."
"18871031","G, an honorary member of the brigade, Sergeants Diueen and Eagan, with a squad of police, kept the spectators off the ground. By some mismanagement the brigade were kept on Champ de Mars street in the snowstorm before the review commenced. The Chief turned out in a white helmet and looked unusually dignified. The brigade first paraded facing the aldermen. There were present fifteen reels, five hook and ladder trucks, the Skinner and Hayes extension ladders, the three Merryweather engines, the Clapp & Jones and the big Shand & Mason engines, the two small Shand & Mason engines and the chemical engine. The physique of the men was greatly admired. The brigade having been inspected by the committee, was first sent round the ground in single file and afterwards the Shand & Mason and Clapp & Jones engines leading, followed by the rest of the brigade, as far as they could manage it, three by three. The two large ladders brought up the rear. Reels Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were put through hose drill. They attached to the hydrant on the St. Gabriel street end of the parade ground, coupled and uncoupled the hose and backed up. No. 3 came out first. In a similar contest between Nos. 4, 5 and 6 No. 4 came out first. The Skinner and Hayes ladders were ruined and hose and men sent up to the top. All the judges seemed pleased with the parade. Chief Palton, Sub-Chiefs McCulloch and Naud were in command. A SAD CASE, Death of a Canadian Gentleman in London. On Saturday an inquest was held on the body of James Robert Sterling, 27, a Canadian gentleman of independent means, lately lodging at 91 Great Russell street, Bloomsbury. Henry Bishop, clerk, stated that the deceased came to lodge with him on August 4th last. He was very reticent and mysterious. He, however, explained that he was on a visit to this country from Canada. Where in the Dominion he resided he did not say. He had a ticket for the British museum reading room, where he passed a great deal of his time. He was very temperate. He seemed to be in an advanced stage of consumption, but he would never admit being ill, and refused to have a medical attendant, remarking that he did not believe in doctors. He was very abstemious, and adhered to a vegetarian diet. On Tuesday morning the deceased was heard to be groaning in his bedroom, and the door being locked, it was forced open, when the deceased was found upon the floor clenching a chair with his hands, and looking very emaciated, pale, and haggard. Dr. Lovitt was called in, and stimulants were administered to the deceased, who, however, expired within four hours. He had arranged to depart for Canada by the Allan line on Thursday, and had paid his passage money. A paper in his pocket contained the address of ""Maxwell, Grey county, Ontario."" In his possession was found £161 4d, which included two cheques for £63, five £5 notes, nine sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and the remainder consisted of silver and bronze money.

It is a baking powder that contains no Ammonia, Lime or Alum. A widow in Burlington, Iowa, whose husband committed suicide, was charged by the family of her husband with being the cause of the suicide. The widow, to vindicate herself, had a spiritualistic séance where departed spirits were called to testify in the case, at which the latter of the suicide was produced. The husband who had suicided was called to the stand and testified that there were no unpleasant relations between himself and wife; that she had been a good wife to him. He further said he did not commit suicide. He had gone to the stable to clean his revolver, and as he stood in the doorway the wind suddenly blew the door against his arm, causing the pistol to be discharged, thus ending his earthly existence. The affair excites not a little comment in Burlington. Omaha line. He was leaning against the lamp-post, and the watchful guardian of the night came up very respectfully.

The other day we noticed the remarkable instance of a babe that was born with a tooth. We now have a still more remarkable case that comes to us from Alpha, this county, this morning. On the first day of October, seventeen days ago, a babe was born to Mrs. Daniel Reed, wife of the little Miami section boss. It soon began to cut its upper teeth, and before it was two weeks old had every one of the upper teeth in sight, and is now cutting the lower teeth. We did not at first credit the story, but upon telephoning to Dr. McClure, find that this story is substantially true. Xenia Gazette. Once in a while, says a shoe salesman, ""I have customers, ladies, whom it takes me an hour or more to serve. They'll want to look at all the shoes there are in the place and to try on a great many."" I had one this morning; she put on several shoes, and each time she would stand on both sides of her foot and twist it around into all sorts of shapes, and insist that the leather ought to be perfectly smooth in every part. When she got tired of pulling shoes on and off she took a pair. They fitted her exactly, though she wasn't satisfied. She thought that when she subjected her feet to such contortions that they almost doubled up the leather above the instep wrinkled too much. Mod to easy to ""Shoe and Leather Reporter."" Destination Date, M suggests as the method of deciding the merits of a team, if followed, will be seen to reverse the positions of the second and third teams. Gordon's team as regards position is two points better than Johnson's, but as regards aggregate time Johnson's is the better by 1 minute 13 seconds. No time was lost, and soon the men had on their street clothes, swallowed a hot lemon, and were on their way back to the city again. It was as fine a cross country race as one would wish to see. The greatest praise an athlete can merit is breaking a record. Under favorable conditions this is something to be proud of, but with the conditions of Saturday and the old record vanishing away in a snowstorm the feat is little short of extraordinary."

"18871121","A SATURDAY NIGHT BLAZE: The Rendering House at the Eastern Abattoir Destroyed. Fires on St. Catherine Street Yesterday. Miss Dupre's and Messrs Grant & McConkey's Premises Damaged. Another large fire occurred in Montreal on Saturday night, whereby the rendering house at the Eastern abattoir was totally destroyed. The rendering house was a three-storey building which stood between the slaughter and packing houses. It was about 75 feet distant from both. The slaughter house is built of wood. In the rendering house there were large quantities of tallow and fat. The fire was first discovered in the rendering house, and it spread like a light placed to a train of gunpowder, and almost like a flash of lightning the entire structure was in a blaze. An alarm was sent out from box 131, and on the arrival of Sub-Chief Naud, the fire was so serious that a second alarm was sent out. The hydrants were useless at first, as the pressure only registered twenty pounds. The Riband & Mason, from St. Jean Baptiste ward, was the first engine on the ground, and it did good work. Engineer Pierson had two streams working off his engine, which were chiefly directed to save the engine house, which had caught fire from the heat. The engine was delayed by the bad state of Rachel street, and while coming along the step was broken and the boiler buried in the dirt. After working in a most creditable manner for six hours the valves broke, owing to a stone getting in from the hydrant. No. 7 Merryweather was also delayed owing to the bad roads. It had to draw its water from a well, but it saved the slaughterhouse from destruction, as, owing to the extreme heat, that building had also caught fire. However, two well-directed streams washed the front of the building, and it escaped, though it was badly scorched. Meanwhile, the rendering house presented a magnificent sight, illuminating the heavens for miles around. A snowstorm was in progress, and this with the intense heat from the burning tallow severely taxed the efforts of the firemen. The building was, however, seen to be doomed, and their principal efforts were to locate the blaze, and in this their efforts were entirely successful. After two hours' hard work the blaze was under control. About 8 o'clock the walls fell out with a rush like thunder, but fortunately no one was hurt. No. 11 stream was kept on all night and all day yesterday playing on the ruins. The damage will be about $30,000, and is nearly covered by insurance policies, which are held by the city. Owing to Mr. Black, the city treasurer, being from home, it was impossible to obtain the names of the companies interested. What proved to be a very serious fire took place yesterday morning at 8 o'clock in the fancy goods store of Miss Dupre, No. 2217 St. Catherine street. The fire originated in the rear of the premises, and quickly spread into the adjoining store of Messrs Grant, McConkey & Co., grocers. The brigade were quickly on hand, and had four streams laid on. The Salvage corps did a splendid service, and saved thousands of dollars' worth of goods from damage. In about half an hour the fire was completely under control. The management was good and Chief Patton is entitled to credit. Miss Dupre's damage will be about $3,000, partly covered by insurance. Messrs Grant, McConkey & Co. have suffered damage to the amount of about $2,000, and are insured in the following offices: London & Lancashire, $3,000; London & Glasgow, $2,000; Aetna, $1,000; Hartford, $1,000. Mr. Robinson's tobacco store, No. 2219, is slightly damaged by smoke. Brown Brothers' meat store was slightly damaged by smoke and fire, but $300 will cover their loss. They are fully insured."

"18871229","THE ANCIENT CAPITAL A Political Shuffle Talked of A Furious Snowstorm Does Much Damage A Big Mearilus Planned (From our own correspondent) Quebec, December 28 A furious snowstorm from the east set in this morning and still continues, raging with great violence. About 9 o'clock the steamer Pilot was at Barras wharf, Levis, when suddenly an enormous mass of ice caught it and pinned it to the wharf, causing considerable damage. It was torn from its fastenings and was being drifted away. It needed all the ability of the captain and crew to prevent a serious accident. Fortunately the steamer got safely up the river to its own wharf. It is said that a deputation from the Quebec Board of Trade will proceed to Ottawa in a few days to wait on the Premier and his colleagues on the ocean mail subsidy question. The deputation will be very strong and representative of the leading interests of the place. The people of the town of Chicoutimi and of Hebertville are organizing a great excursion to Quebec, via the Lake St. John railway, on the occasion of the opening of the Provincial Legislature. A number of merchants from Chicoutimi have been in town since the beginning of the winter, all coming by rail, although the distance from Chicoutimi to Lake St. John is so considerable. Goods to and from Chicoutimi are also sent by this route. There is a rumor on the street, which is given for what it is worth, to the effect that a swap is on the tapis by which Hon. Mr. Shebryn and Mr. Francois Langelier will change positions, Mr. Shebryn going to Ottawa to sit in the Commons, and Mr. Langelier assuming for the time being, during Mr. Mercier's illness, the post of Acting Premier of the province. Messrs. Shebryn and Langelier each represent Quebec constituencies so strongly Liberal in their tendencies that there would be no risk in making the proposed arrangement. NEW GRAIN STANDARDS For Manitoba Wheat Strongly Denounced by the Toronto Board of Trade Toronto, December 28 The grain and flour sections of the Board of Trade met this afternoon to consider the order-in-council changing the present standard of grain for Manitoba and the Northwest. After a warm discussion the following resolution was passed by the grain section and ordered to be telegraphed to Mr. Hull, Inland Revenue department, Ottawa: ""That, whereas an order-in-council has been passed changing the grades of Manitoba wheat, which will disarrange and cause endless trouble in carrying out contracts already entered into for future delivery on the basis of present grades, as well as necessitating the withdrawal of all samples now in the hands of foreign buyers and the furnishing of new standards, thereby causing great delay and cessation of business operations; therefore, be it resolved, that this board desires to express its strong feeling of disapprobation at the changing of grain standards by the governor-in-council without consulting the commercial interests of the country through their various channels; and would, therefore, move that the council of this Board of Trade take such action in the matter as they may deem best to obtain, if possible, the remanding of the order-in-council until such time as all interested are consulted and their views ascertained."" The flour section passed the following resolutions: Resolved, ""That whereas an order-in-council has been passed amending the standard of Manitoba wheat, and which is fraught with most pressing import to all millers and flour dealers, any change at this time when the grades are fixed, approved and known, is undesirable and likely to obstruct business and also involve in litigation all contracts of sale fixed and still executed. Resolved that this section deprecates the fact that any change in existing standards of grain is not possible, not coming through the regular constituted board of grain examiners, who should be, in our opinion, the only authority possible."" The council of the Board of Trade will meet tomorrow, and it is probable a deputation will be appointed to wait upon the government at Ottawa.

"18880103","ANEOI, DSATTL OF AS IMINENT BOATBUILDER, The Sporting Life says: A man well-known to generations of university oarsmen has passed away, Mr. Edward Searle, the boatbuilder of Lambeth, who for many years officiated as starter of the Oxford and Cambridge boat race, has joined the majority. It was seldom, indeed, that any fault could be found with the way in which he performed his duties, but it comes to all of us to make mistakes at times, and in the race of 1883 he certainly permitted the Oxford crew to obtain a great advantage at the beginning of the contest. The Cambridge stroke hesitated whether to go, and would have been much wiser to have remained stationary. This, it will be remembered, was the year when they were such strong favorites: but they were completely ""chopped"" at the start, and never drew on even terms with Oxford throughout the race, which was also noticeable for the late hour at which it took place, the lamps on Putney Old Bridge being lit just before the boats were in position, and a snowstorm coming on, what with a driving wind and the darkness, but little could be seen of the race.

In view of this fact, the meeting will probably be postponed until Monday. The prospects of a speedy agreement on the fishery matter are said to be not quite so good as when Mr. Chamberlain returned from Canada. At all events, from statements which Mr. Chamberlain himself recently made, it appears that he does not anticipate an immediate agreement. He was asked this morning if he expected to return to England soon. He replied that his duties would detain him in Washington for another month at least. An American View, Washington, January 6 It is believed that when the fisheries negotiators resume their conference on Saturday, the British representatives will formally announce that they are willing to accept Secretary Bayard's suggestion that the question of the commercial rights of our fishing vessels in Canadian waters and of the three-mile limit be submitted to arbitration. Then, as a matter of grace and not of right, they will concede us the rights we claim as to both points pending the decision of the arbiters, which might not be reached until the next fishing season is over. This would be satisfactory to the American negotiators because they have no doubt that any arbitrator that might be selected would decide in our favor, and they feel equally confident that the Senate would ratify any convention or treaty that might be concluded providing for the submission of the matter to arbitration. The British commissioners and the Canadian officials who accompany them have learned a great deal about the temper and purpose of the people of the United States on this question that they did not know before they came. They understand now that these two purely questions must be disposed of before the question of commercial reciprocity can be considered, and that the surest way to a favorable treaty of commercial reciprocity is by a treaty respecting the fisheries which will be favorable to our claims. Kanaka B c Down, San Francisco, January 6 A letter from Honolulu, dated December 21, says the cabinet has made a demand that Judge Jonathan Austin, of Honolulu, shall be offered the place of Godfrey Brown, who recently resigned from the cabinet. The cabinet has also demanded the appointment of Sanford D, a prominent lawyer, born here of American parents, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Judge Torbad of the Supreme Court. At last advice, the King had decided to accede to the cabinet's demands, knowing that the Reform League would otherwise place Mrs. D'Uinnux, the King's sister, on the throne. Ulaka has been advised by the English and American ministers to comply with the demands of his cabinet with assurances that they would not interfere in his behalf with the demands of the Reform League. The Reading Strike, Philadelphia, January 6 The only utterance that could be gotten directly from General Manager McLeod this morning was that ""There is no change in the situation."" There are some forty furnaces located along the line of the Reading Railroad, and today after much correspondence, the Reading Coal and Iron Company supplied some of the most needy furnaces with coal, but at an advance of fifty cents per ton delivered at Schuylkill Haven. The increased price of fuel may result in closing down the furnaces. The miners of the Excelsior colliery at Shamokin have refused to continue work because the coal is the Reading road. A general meeting of miners will be held tomorrow. The opinion prevails that the miners working at individual collieries shipping over the Reading road will all quit work. Almost a coal famine prevails there. Everything is quiet. The Rebellions Knights, Chicago, January 6 The latest move in the rebellion among the Knights of Labor is the organization of a provisional committee of rebels in Washington, and a circular has been issued by them and received by the secretary of the National Provisional Committee in this city. The circular contains an enumeration of the demands of the rebels at Washington, which are in substance the same as those of the Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia rebels heretofore published. Stock shaken Up, Cleveland, Ohio, January 6 A heavily loaded eastbound freight train collided with light freight westbound on the Nickel Plate road near Willoughby, Ohio, at 1:30 this morning. The eastbound train was loaded with live stock and dressed beef. Fifteen cars were demolished and many others were badly damaged, but no one was injured except a shipper, who received a trifling scalp wound. He Didn't Get His Information, Washington, January 9 Mr. Singly's resolution calling upon the President for information relative to alleged discrimination by the Canadian Government against American shipping passing through the Welland Canal was discussed by the committee on merchant marine and fisheries, but the committee adjourned without action upon the matter. About Barbed Wire, Des Moines, Iowa, January 6 Judge Shira yesterday rendered a decision in the case of the Washburne & Moen Company vs. ""The Best Wire All Barbed Wire Company,"" of Cedar Falls. The findings are that Alvin Morley invented the same style of barbs covered by the Giddon patents in 1830. The decision nullifies the Giddon barb wire patents. A Million Dollar Dividend, Pittsburgh, January 6 At a meeting of the stockholders of the Westinghouse Airbrake Co. this afternoon, the plan of the board of directors to increase the capital stock of the corporation from $3,000,000 to $4,000,000 was adopted. It is stated that $1,000,000 of this increase will go to stockholders in the shape of a dividend. Cattle Disease Rampant, New York, January 6 Pleuro-pneumonia among cattle is still prevalent in the upper part of Westchester County.

"18880118","L. O. Pereira, of Ottawa, was delayed by the snowstorm and arrived just as the meeting closed. After reading the minutes, the secretary made known what had been done by correspondence with other cities, and only Halifax and St. John, N.B., had returned names of representatives. On account of the poor success attending the election of a council by correspondence, the following section had been inserted in the by-laws: The officers of this association shall consist of a president, three vice-presidents and a secretary-treasurer, who, with a council of fifteen members, shall form the executive of the association. They shall be elected annually at each annual meeting. The by-laws were then read clause by clause and a few changes made. When the question of a championship programme was reached, the omission of a five-mile race gave rise to much discussion and it was finally voted to have a five-mile race at the championship meeting, which will be held on the third Thursday in February, and on the second Thursday in February will be given a championship fancy skating tournament. The rest of the constitution and by-laws were adopted with very little discussion. The list of figures for fancy skating was then read and no objection was made until the question of specialties was reached, when Mr. Rubenstein thought that 100 points was entirely too much. Mr. Stevenson thought that the specialties should be left at 100, so that a stranger, who, perhaps, had only seen the Canadian list a short time previous, would be somewhat handicapped if he did not have a chance to catch up. This gave rise to an animated discussion, after which Mr. Louis Rubenstein moved an amendment to the effect that specialties be reduced to 60 instead of 100. This motion was carried by a vote of 6 to 1. Louis Rubenstein, A. Rubenstein, D."

"18880120","THE CHOP OUTLOOK A Generally Favorable Review of the Agricultural Situation Rochester, NY, January 19 The American Rural Home, of this city, from its crop correspondence from all sections of the country, summarizes the present crop situation as follows: Farmers throughout the spring wheat belt are in very hopeful condition, although the movement in spring wheat is very light. The belt is generally covered with a heavy fall of snow, which is regarded as a favorable omen for next season's crop. In spite of favorable reports by the Agricultural Department, it is generally believed that the acreage of winter wheat is considerably below last season, and that the reserve of wheat is practically small. This will be an important element in determining next season's prices. January shows a very small movement in corn and excellent prices for home consumption. Farmers, who generally burn their surplus corn, now find no difficulty in disposing of it at from thirty-five to forty cents per bushel. This has put a large amount of money in circulation. Hay commands a much larger price than usual throughout large sections of the country, but the advance has not been as great as anticipated. Dakota is furnishing a large supply which makes good the deficiency. The shortage of hogs still continues, amounting down to January 14 to 500,000 head, with the probability of running much higher. High prices of corn and low values of beef have greatly restricted the number of cattle fed for beef this winter. DOWN BY THE SEA Had Death of a Young Slave Carrier The Vacant See of Halifax Complained of Waste of Railway Car from our correspondent Halifax, NS, January 19 The heavy snowstorm of yesterday and today has blocked up roads in all parts of the province. The Montreal mail was ten hours late today. The Archbishop of Canterbury cabled that he cannot make a nomination to the Nova Scotia bishopric, and the synod will make another attempt to elect its own bishop. The fire in Albion mine is still raging. That in the eastern slope could be extinguished with about eight million gallons of water, but there is no water. That in the western slope will be left to its fate. Coal managers are greatly dissatisfied at the inability of the Intercolonial Railway to handle the coal traffic. One of the slopes at Springhill closed because it cannot get cars to transport the coal. A boy named Galong, aged 15, was sent across the ice on Ark-bat harbor with the mail bags to Robin's Bay station. He started at five o'clock in the heavy storm and has not since been seen. He is supposed to have fallen through the ice and been drowned. Mail agent Charles Lenoir, who sent him on his perilous mission under such circumstances, is bitterly condemned."

Incoming vessels report thrilling experiences. The mail steamer Harula is still detained and is not likely to sail tomorrow. Fifteen vessels are frozen in the basin of Mill Das. The Annapolis post office was burglarized under cover of last night's storm, and all registered letter and four through-mail bags were stolen. There is no clue. Annapolis has a bad reputation for unknown burglars and firebugs. The house of Alexander Beaton, of Boular-darle, C.B., was burned during the snowstorm last Thursday night, and Beaton's wife and child were cremated.

The statement that the grain market at Oak Lake is blocked for lack of cars is denied by residents of that place. At a sale of school lands at Portage La Prairie today, forty-two lots realized $57,600.

"18880127","Y, January 26 The worst snowstorm experienced in this vicinity this winter set in last night and continued well into this morning. All the railroads centering here are badly drifted and trains are all delayed. The wind is making their condition worse hourly, and the chances are that several of the roads will be completely blocked before night. The sleeper from Montreal on the Delaware & Hudson road, due here about 7 a.m., is still in a snowbank between Fort Edward and Smith's Basin, and it is not known when it will be able to get through. The blockade is the worst north of here, but it is bad on all sides. The St. Louis limited express on the Erie railway, due at New York at 11 a.m., is badly snowed in one mile west of Middletown. A Whitehall dispatch says a terrible snowstorm is raging along the west shore of Lake Champlain. It is the worst storm that has visited the section in years. Boston, January 26 Reports from Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont state that the heaviest snowstorm for years prevailed all night and travel is badly impeded. Advices from Old Orchard and stations west on the Boston & Maine railroad say a regular blizzard is prevailing. Quebec, January 26 A blinding snowstorm set in last night and continued all day. The country roads are almost impassable in places, the drifts being six and seven feet, while on the levee it has fallen about 18 inches. All the trains have been delayed. Toronto, January 26 The heaviest storm of the season was experienced here and in the west today. Trains in all directions were badly delayed, and in some cases abandoned. Reading, Pa., January 20 The worst snowstorm that has visited this section for several years prevailed here today. Some of the country roads are simply impassable. Trains on the Reading railroad and branches were all late, and on the Reading & Columbia railroad the train due here at 2:30 p.m. had not arrived at 8 this evening, and is not expected in tonight as it is lying between two snowdrifts at Marretta Junction. At some places along the railroad the snow has drifted ten and fifteen feet deep. It is learned that a similar state of affairs exists throughout the coal regions and that in consequence not a single colliery was in operation this afternoon and not a ton of coal has been shipped since yesterday.

Special telegrams to Braustreet's note some interference with the distribution of general merchandise by the heavy snowstorm and extremely low temperature. While there have been delays on railways, northwest, west and east, the late blockade at the Northwest has been partially raised and there is an increase in orders received for general merchandise, notably at Chicago where prices have, with some exceptions (grain), tended upward, and where business has improved. At Memphis, St. Louis and Kansas City there is some gain in orders and in the volume of goods shipped without special activity. Milder weather at St. Louis and Denver has helped business. In Southern Texas and in Louisiana wet weather has rendered the country roads nearly impassable, and the distribution of merchandise, as well as the shipment of farm produce, has been checked in consequence. At Pittsburgh, Omaha, Burlington, Iowa, and Detroit similar conditions prevail. Dry goods, boots and shoes and hardware remain relatively most sellable, east and west. The LEADING MONEY MARKET continues quite easy, New York notably more so than previously, pointing to the probability that the reduction of Government deposits with national banks may be accomplished, if attempted, with little or no disturbance to the money or merchandise markets. Rates of discount generally are merely nominal. At Kansas City collections are difficult, but elsewhere in nearly all instances are satisfactory. The New York stock market is dull and strong. Easy money and demand for investment bonds encourage the bulls and render bear operations unprofitable. Prices, which were depressed at the opening of the week, have improved materially. Money is very easy and in large supply, call loans being 2 to 4 and 6 to 5.4 per cent for best names. Our special report from the treasury shows that the government's gross receipts for the week are $60,841,686, a decrease of over $1,760,000, as compared with last week. The available balance is $80,886,064, an increase of over $3,130,000. The treasurer's balance with depository banks is $52,020,564, an increase of over $1,900,000.

Now they come again demanding more sacrifice in men and money. When these demands are satisfied, what assurance is there that the country will have anything sufficient to give it rest from its military burdens? Count Von Schellundorf, minister of war, curtly responded that if the approval of the Sepennate bill had been associated with any promise of permanent peace it was a mistake. The Government's aim was to protect the country, and the best way to do so was to make it strong against all attacks. Fighting for Personal Liberty, Berlin, January 28. There was a stormy debate in the Reichstag to-day on the anti-Socialist bill. In the lobbies the consensus of opinion was that the Government would be defeated if they persisted in attempting to pass the bill. The National Liberals, Centrists and Progressists all declared against the measure. The Centrists will join the National Liberals in advocating the prolonging of the period for operation of the present law two years. Such a measure the Government will be forced to accept, besides abandoning the new repressive clauses. Herr Bimberger made a powerful speech; he especially attacked the paragraph enacting that any German who takes part in a foreign country in a meeting to promote the doctrines of Socialism shall be punished with imprisonment and deprived of his rights as a citizen. He denounced this clause as the acme of unwise legislation and a disgrace to a civilized government. Prince Bismarck intended to be present, but his arrival at Berlin had been delayed owing to a severe attack of neuralgia in his face. BelsTlntu's Sugar Interests, Brussels, January 28. Baron Henry de Worms, British Parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade, has arrived here seeking to induce Belgium to join all the other powers which advocate making and refining sugar in bond. Belgium hesitates to follow the course of other nations in this matter on account of popular opposition. Baron de Worms will urge Belgium to abolish the sugar tax, which only produces 1,000,000 francs annually, four-fifths of the Belgian sugar being exported.

Independent Joke London, February 14 Mr. Bright, writing to a correspondent to deny that he attends Tory meetings, argues against the idea that Liberals are bound to follow their leader. He asks who blames him now for deserting the Liberals at the time of the Crimean and Soudan wars? Although at the time of the former he was attacked more than he is now, in the former war, he continues, there were lost 500,000 lives, and in the latter 50,000 lives. Am I to prostrate myself before a leader in whose great career there are blunders so enormous? If Mr. Gladstone's Irish bills, which are now universally condemned, are dead, why does he not produce a new policy for public discussions? I have always opposed, and must always oppose, having two parliaments in the Kingdom. Britain and the Atlantic London, February 14 Sir James Fergusson, Under Foreign Secretary, explained in the House of Commons today that in stating recently that the British Government was not pledged to military action in behalf of any European power he implied naval action also. Beyond the treaties known to the country none existed. He declined to produce the correspondence with European governments. The production of such correspondence, he said, was not in accordance with uniform precedent, nor was it advisable in view of the present situation.

This evening he partook of solid food for the first time since the operation and seemed to enjoy it. Dr. Mackenzie, in his report on the Crown Prince's case, will note Prof. Virchow's declaration that he found no indications of malignant disease in the matter examined by him.

"18880217","ANOTHER CRISIS IN FRANCE: ""Rumor About the Colonial Secretary Government Aid for Certain French Bishops to be Prosecuted"", London, February 10: In the House of Commons today Mr. Labouchere asked if any despatch from the British ambassador at Berlin suggested that England give assurances to Italy which would induce her to enter the Austro-German alliance. Sir James Fergusson, under foreign secretary, replied that he must again decline to produce correspondence between the British Government and foreign powers regarding affairs in Europe. The house, he said, would recognize that at the present time it would be unwise to produce such correspondence. Mr. Labouchere thereupon gave notice that he would offer an amendment to the address ""That the house be informed definitely that no correspondence exchanged with Italy had resulted in binding action on the British Government in the event of war between Italy and France, or if any assurances had been given that they be communicated to the house."" (Cheers) Another French Crisis, Paris, February 10: The Chamber of Deputies today by a vote of 206 to 83 rejected the Dreyfus amendment transferring the functions of treasurer and paymaster-general to the Bank of France. The Chamber afterwards, despite Mr. Tirard's protests, resolved to consider Mr. Houbouyan's amendment reducing the interest on the floating debt by 3,000,000 francs. The Chamber, despite the appeal of the Government, then voted to take into consideration a measure providing for reductions in the salaries of treasury paymasters. Premier Tirard thereupon left the chamber, declaring that he would resign. The latest reports deny that Mr. Tirard has resigned and are to the effect that he will await the decision of the Budget committee before deciding upon the action of the Cabinet. Russia Irritated, St. Petersburg, February 16: Reports from the interior of the empire concur in stating that the publication of the Austro-German treaty, taken in connection with Bismarck's speech on the military bill, has created intense irritation among all classes.

She requires such extensive alterations that she will practically have to be rebuilt before she can be put in commission. De Brazza in Ill Odor, Paris, February 10: De Brazza, the African explorer, returned to Paris yesterday. It is not likely that he will return to the Congo in an official capacity.

It has received complaints from members of his mission charging him with working less for France than with personal and ambitious object, and accusing him of having recklessly squandered funds. Wintry Weather, London, February 16: The gale and snowstorm in England, which began on the 14th inst., continues. Railway lines are blocked, and in Wiltshire two days' mail remain undelivered. London, February 16: Fearful snowstorms prevail on the continent. In some parts of Switzerland the snow is seven metres deep, and numerous avalanches have occurred, attended by loss of life. The Bank of France, Paris, February 16: At a meeting of the Cabinet today it was decided to oppose the motion of M. Sano Leroy, member of the Chamber of Deputies, for the appointment of a parliamentary committee to examine into the privileges of the Bank of France on the ground that such motion infringes the prerogatives of the executive.

Barrister Stoner, of Virden, who mysteriously disappeared about three weeks ago and was supposed to have perished on the prairie in a snowstorm, has been located at Barnesville, Minn. No reason is given for his departure. Some person invited the Salvation Army to the opening of a hotel near the station on Friday night without the consent of the owner. When they appeared a small row occurred in which the army got the worst of it. On Saturday morning at 3 o'clock, Robert MacLean, a student of St. John's College, while going home was held up by three men who robbed him. He gave a description of the highwaymen who were arrested in a few hours. A telegram from Gleichen says: The Indians at North Camp, Crowfoot Reserve, killed a valuable cow belonging to Dutch Patrick, divided the meat among the participants and put the skin under the ice of the river. Patrick followed the trail of the blood to the tepees and to the river. The mounted police went to the camp and arrested 3 of the parties who were brought to Gleichen and kept securely ironed.

"18880227","SNOWSHOE CLUB WENT TO BUCKINGHAM Notwithstanding the threatening weather and the possibility of being snowed up, there was a large number of the tuque bleue and tuque purple who took the train on Saturday morning for Buckingham. An elaborate programme had been laid out and nearly all the participants in it went by the first train. Some others waited until four o'clock in the afternoon. The excursionists will get back in time for business this morning if another snowstorm does not spoil their calculations. NO RACES The boys of the preparatory High School were to have had their annual snowshoe races on the Shamrock grounds Saturday afternoon. The snowstorm prevented their being held. They will probably take place during the week. SHERBROOKE TO THE FRONT The Sherbrooke people don't do things by halves in the way of sport especially, and the latest outcome of their enterprise is the new Snowshoe Clubhouse, which was formally opened last week. The Clubhouse is a log structure, hidden amongst the trees, about forty yards back from the main road. Its dimensions are 20 x 30 feet, with a projection both in front and rear, the latter being used as a kitchen. The logs are most substantially put together, and with the grand big chimney built for four feet wood, the whole building has an appearance of comfort and cheerfulness which is most enticing and must be a source of satisfaction to the members. In its account of the opening the Sherbrooke Grit says: The muster for tramp had been called for 8 o'clock at the Art rooms, and, as a general invitation had been extended to the lady friends of members, quite a number of the fair sex appeared equipped for the tramp, as well as a strong muster of the members. Through the kindness of Mr. Hale, a large team was provided to carry the ladies to the top of the Hostwick hill, where snowshoes were fastened on, and under the leadership of the energetic captain of the club, Mr. George McNicol, a start was made across the country for the Clubhouse. A comparatively easy route had been chosen, and, to the honor of the ladies who tramped, be it said, that the pace was a good one, and the stops few until the house was reached. The members had evidently gone to some trouble in preparing for the occasion, as upon approaching the Clubhouse, countless torches and Chinese lanterns could be seen, while a perfect shower of fireworks welcomed the trampers and completed a very pretty scene. Upon entering the house it was noticeable that quite as great a number had taken the easier, if not so exciting method of driving, instead of walking, and all the available space was required to accommodate those present, who numbered nearly 100, of whom fully one-half were ladies."

Talking About the Treaty, some journalists continue to discuss the fisheries treaty. The Chronicle, one of the Liberal-Unionist organs, is rather inclined to doubt the benefits of the treaty from a British view, though it argues it is grossly unfair to suggest that Canada has surrendered all along the line. The Tory St. James Gazette declares in favor of the treaty, and believes that neither the Dominion Parliament nor the United States Senate will take the responsibility of bringing back the conditions of friction and irritation which formerly prevailed. Houlanger's Keeneel, Paris, March 5, Gen.

De Lesseps' Last Chance, Paris, March 5, in the Chamber of Deputies to-day a bill was laid on the table which proposes to authorize the Panama Canal company to issue a lottery loan of 24,000,000 francs.

The preamble cites the necessity of furnishing M. de Lesseps with means to continue the construction of the canal and prove the enterprise feasible, and states that the time is ripe to fix public opinion upon the ultimate prospects of the canal and settle the question one way or the other. The British Navy, London, March 5, Lord George Hamilton, first lord of the admiralty, has issued a statement regarding the navy estimates for 1888.

During 1867 twenty torpedo boats were added, making a total of eighty first class and sixty-three second class. During the coming year six first class and ten second class will be ordered. The efficiency of the officers and men throughout the service is highly satisfactory. Honored by His Countrymen, Cork, March 5, the arrival of the body of Stephen J.

the direct expenditure for clearing snow being $592,000, over double the average cost for the last six years, while the indirect cost may be set down as at least $100,000 The expensive work of substituting 67 lb steel rails for the 65 lb rails in use has been continued; 78 miles having been laid with the heavier rail One hundred and forty-three miles of new fences of improved pattern were built during the year; 49 new sidings were put in, and various other means were adopted for increasing the efficiency and security of the road, as to which the detail reports to be found in the annexed appendices give evidence The height traffic increase of the year has extended to the following important articles, among others: Flour, grain, lumber, live stock and coal With regard to the last mentioned, the development of which is a matter of peculiar interest both to the coal producing districts and the upper provinces, there has been a steady increase throughout the last few years, the quantity carried last year being 175,512 tons, as against 15,791 in the previous year, and 570 tons in the year 1879 The low rate charged for transport and the distance of haulage of cars back to the mines, empty, render this branch of traffic, though advantageous to the country, unremunerative to the road The SUBSIDIES The Windsor and Annapolis Railway Company are permitted to continue the operations of this line, which is 32 miles in length; the arrangement being that the company pay all charges in connection with the working, two-thirds of the gross earnings being allowed them for the purpose, the Government taking the remaining third and assuming all cost of maintenance The expenditure under this arrangement was $20,042 and the receipts $25,327, showing a loss of $715 The substitution of steel for iron rails and the construction of new buildings accounts for this The Eastern Extension railway, extending from the Pictou branch of the Intercolonial at New Glasgow to Port Mulgrave, on the Strait of Canso, is worked in connection with the Intercolonial Its management shows a loss of $30,146, due, it is stated, as was a similar state of things last year, to the absence of the rich traffic from the Strait of Canso, through United States fishermen being debarred from landing their fish in Canada The Indiantown branch of 11 miles, from Derby station to Indiantown is complete and under operation The Pictou town branch has been far carried to completion"

"18880313","1UI TOIIONTO TOPICS, Senator O'Donohue has laid a narrow escape from drowning or death by cold. He got an involuntary bath in the Bay of Quinte while participating in the Prince Edward election fight. He, with Peter Ryan and others, was driving from Trenton to Deseronto when they came to a break in the ice, too late to stop the horse. Senator O'Donohue was thrown over the dashboard into the water headforemost. He succeeded in grasping the edge of the ice and was rescued by Peter Ryan. The Senator is now in his bed in Toronto, and his doctor thinks the danger is not serious. At a meeting of the council of the Board of Trade this afternoon, a resolution was passed respectfully urging the Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific railway companies to consider the advisability of opening negotiations to bring about the erection of a grand passenger station common to all railways centering in Toronto, which would be greatly to the interests of the city, also a great convenience to the traveling public generally and to the material advantage of the railways. An influential committee was appointed to represent the council at any meeting held to further that object. At a meeting of the city council tonight, Mayor Clarke also referred to the importance of having a grand union station erected, and a committee was appointed to cooperate with other bodies in the matter. The city council tonight passed a resolution expressing the sorrow of the council at the demise of the late Emperor of Germany. SOME SERIOUS CHARGES AGAINST Toronto Civic Officials and Aldermen to be Investigated. A meeting of the City council was held tonight, at which considerable discussion took place upon a series of charges formulated by Aid Gillespie to the effect that officials and members of the council have been guilty of practices not in the interests of the city affairs. He asked that a sworn investigation be held into the matter and that it be referred to the county court judge. The motion was strongly opposed by members of the council, who held that the case was such as might be dealt with by a committee. The objection raised against this was that the committee could not compel the attendance of witnesses, nor insist on the production of documentary evidence. After a great deal of noisy discussion, the council agreed that the matter be referred to the county court judge. QUEER NEW YORK BANKING. One of the most curious financial operations ever brought to light is set forth in the account elsewhere given of the scheme by which a gang of impetuous owners of coal lands in the Hocking Valley, not paid for, with the cooperation of a banking house in this city, got possession of three railroads, consolidated them into one, and got extravagant pay for their lands out of the bonds issued by themselves. The strangest part of it is the readiness with which they obtained a loan of $6,000,000 from the bankers to buy up the railroads, before they had anything to secure it with, and on the promised security of stock which they did not yet own, and of the bonds of a consolidated company not yet formed, which bonds were to be secured on the property of a railroad over which they had no control, and on their coal lands, which were to be paid for out of the proceeds of those very bonds. Having got the loan of money on this extraordinary agreement, they proceeded to carry out their scheme with wonderful success, having bought the cooperation of the president of the three railroad companies to be brought out and consolidated. But the consolidated company is now in new hands, and has a president who has ferreted out all these proceedings and purposes to recover for the company the assets purchased by its bonds, for which it has at present nothing to show. This is a striking example of the process of railroad wrecking for the THE BOREAL BLASTS BLOW. Unprecedented Snowstorm in the Eastern States. H. Oellke, a butcher, was overcome by the storm in Park Row this morning and fell unconscious in a snowbank. His condition is critical. Many of the courts were not open today, owing to the non-arrival of the judges. None of the heads of the city departments put in an appearance. The temperature at 1 p.m. today was six degrees above. On Long Island, the storm is the worst in the memory of the oldest inhabitant. Traffic and business of all kinds are practically suspended. In J., the storm has caused a suspension of all traffic. No horse cars are running and no trains moving on any of the railroads. The snow has drifted in the streets to a depth of five and six feet. Troy, Poughkeepsie, and Canajoharie report a similar condition of affairs existing. COLLISIONS IN THE STORM. At 7:10 this morning, two trains collided at the Seventy-sixth Street station of the elevated road. The rear car partly sandwiched into the forward car, which, it appears, was standing at the depot. The engineer of the rear engine was killed and the locomotive literally smashed to pieces. Several people were slightly injured. The accident is attributed to the blinding snowstorm causing a slippery track. PITTSBURG, March 12. A collision between the second section of the passenger train No. 9, westbound, and an eastbound freight occurred near Huntingdon, Pa., on the Pennsylvania railroad about 3 o'clock this morning. Engineer Gardner and Fireman Murray of the passenger train were killed, a freight brakeman was seriously injured, and a passenger on one of the sleeping cars had his head slightly cut. The western mail express reached Altoona at 1 o'clock. The passengers report the complete wreck of the first sleeper and the second partly, but all the passengers were safe, beyond the three in the first coach, who were seriously injured. Fireman Mowry of the freight was also killed. The wreck involves a loss of $75,000. A GENERAL TRAIN BLOCKADE. THE MAYOR'S INAUGURAL. He Reviews the Civic Events of the Expired Year. SPEAKS OF OUR POSITION And Enters a Protest Against Unwarranted Attacks Upon the City's Good Name. The annual inaugural meeting of the City council took place yesterday afternoon with a clustering snowstorm without and a flowery bower within the civic hall. The decorations in the Council chamber were neat and in good taste. The columns of the Mayor's seat were twined with evergreens and azaleas and beautiful hanging baskets. Long swings of the same material extended from all available points to the center gallery, where they were all gathered in an ornate circle, from which were suspended numerous blooms. On the galleries were the following mottoes prettily worked in evergreens: ""First Meeting, 1888, Premiere Seance,"" and ""Concordia Salus; Union Fait la Force."" Everywhere were bouquets and baskets filled with many bright and variegated plants and blooms. Besides the aldermen, nearly all of whom were present, there were many ladies who added additional charm to the scene. Among these were Mayor Abbott's eldest daughter, Madame Grenier, Madame Laurent, Madame Hobert, Miss McBride, Miss Kennedy, Miss McDougall, Madame Martineau, Madame Germain, Misses Malone, Madame Hamelin, Mrs. Win. Kennedy, Mrs. and Miss Cunningham, Miss Conroy, Madame Perreault, Madame Holland, Madame Prefontaine, Misses Gauthier, Mrs. Dan Wilson, Mrs. Tansy, Madame Hurteau. These ladies were presented with handsome bouquets. The aldermen themselves were nearly all in evening dress, wearing boutonnières and presented a very gay appearance. A few moments after three, His Worship Mayor Abbott entered, wearing his chain of office, and was greeted with loud applause. The City Clerk then administered the oath of office to the Mayor, all the aldermen standing. He was conducted to his seat by Aid Grenier and Laurent, the senior members of the council. The report of the Board of Supervisors was then read by the City Clerk, giving the result of the recent elections. This was adopted. The newly elected aldermen, Stevenson, Perreault, Conroy, Griffin, Clendinnen, Dubois, Hurteau, Robert, Prefontaine, Morris, Gauthier, and Germain were then sworn by the City Clerk and duly presented to the Mayor. BRITISH PHILOSOPHY. British philosophy teaches us (remember, there is a great difference between British and English) to like what we have when we cannot get what we want. The English papers can take a moral victory out of a defeat. They even thanked heaven that the Americans had done so well since the Declaration of Independence, though they really thought they would have done better if they had remained with England. They consoled themselves with the proverb that ""Ce qui est, est."" The French have no philosophy and do not know how to use it. They consider defeat a disgrace; cannot stand criticism, and hate their enemies in spite of the good they are supposed to do us. Political differences in France prevent men from being private friends; in England, this is not yet the case, but is perhaps becoming so. In the French Assembly, a member will tell another, ""It is a lie;"" in the English House of Commons, they say it is a variation from the strict lines of truth. An Englishman is the staunchest monarchist and the freest man in Europe. In France, men are dangerous demagogues if they ask for liberties long since granted in England. The revolutionists and anarchists were quickly disposed of as having only an importance given them by government officials. The lecturer had attended a meeting of workingmen in France to select candidates, but all wanted to be candidates, so every man got one vote. The English official is a servant; the French is a master. An English chemist wrote to Cairo for information from the consul, got an immediate answer, and went there to do a rushing business; a French chemist wrote at the same time and never got an answer. He is still waiting, and that was three years ago. The lecturer then gave details of political matters in the two countries, contrasting them very cleverly and humorously, interspersed with many telling anecdotes, among which was the following: About four years ago, he was traveling on the Metropolitan line in England. Two old ladies sat in the compartment. They were discussing ""John Bull and His Island."" Said one: ""Have you read that book? What do you think of it?"" The answer was, ""Not much; but what can you expect of an Irishman?"" The lecturer concluded with these words: ""In Canada, you have the tang of John Bull, because you have listened for an hour and twenty minutes to my murdering the English language."" The lecture was delivered with a naivete and charm that only a very clever pen could reproduce, and the very slight accent with which M. Blouct speaks was fascinating in the extreme. He was heartily applauded throughout. Mr. David then thanked the lecturer on behalf of the audience for his able effort and asked that a lecture be given in French. This will accordingly be done on Saturday evening next, the subject being ""Souvenirs Anecdotiques de l'Ecosse."" On Friday evening, the subject of the lecture will be ""John Bull and Sandy MacDonald."" This is considered the most humorous of Max O'Neill's series. THE SNOWSTORM. The city was visited yesterday by a snowstorm, accompanied by high winds, which lasted all day, and at an early hour this morning the streets were almost impassable. Nearly nine inches of snow had fallen by midnight. Railway traffic was interrupted to a certain extent, and all the outgoing trains carried snowplows. Nearly all the incoming trains were delayed more or less. The Grand Trunk No. 4 East, from Portland, due at 8:13 p.m., was 2 hours and 10 minutes late. The mails ex-steamship Sardinian will arrive by train No. 2 this morning at 6 o'clock. The Central Vermont No. 12 train, from Boston, due at 8:40 p.m., was five hours behind scheduled time, and the Central Vermont No. 6, from New York, due at 11:30 p.m., was cancelled. The Delaware & Hudson No. 14, from New York, due at 10:40 p.m., was delayed two hours. The outgoing trains were dispatched on time. The Quebec train on the Canadian Pacific railway was four and a half hours late, the South Eastern one and a half hours, and the Winnipeg thirty-six hours late. All the others were on time. AN EXPROPRIATION CASE. Mr. Justice Wartelin rendered judgment yesterday in the case of Eeburn vs. the Ontario & Quebec railway company. It appears that the plaintiff gave defendants possession of his ground on their depositing $1,000 security in the Bank of Montreal. The award of the arbitrators was for $1,500, and the plaintiff filed a petition asking that the bank be ordered to pay interest on the award. The company contested this, alleging that the interest could only run from the date of the award, and that, even supposing the amount to be due, the judge had no power to order such payment out of the amount deposited. His Honor upheld the pretensions of the company. Notice of appeal was given. The cleansing, antiseptic, and healing qualities of Dr. Sage's Catarrh Remedy are unequalled.

"18880315","MANY LIVES SACRIFICED, Malen Island completely Blockaded Several Vessels Reported Lost Railways Railways Concerning Relief, New York, March 14 The battle against the snowdrifts, which was carried on all day yesterday and throughout the greater part of last night, has effected a considerable change for the better in the condition of the two cities of New York and Brooklyn, so far as the means of internal communication are concerned, and the streets of both began this morning to show some signs of renewed activity. The New Yorkers had an advantage over their Brooklyn brethren, for they had four elevated roads running with something like their ordinary regularity, and an immense number of business men were thus enabled to get to their offices with comparative speed and comfort, whereas in Brooklyn there is only one elevated road in running condition, and that was so vastly overtasked that it was of little appreciable benefit to anybody who did not live almost on the line of it. Thousands of Brooklynites trudged manfully along the various thoroughfares leading to the East River bridge and seemed to enjoy the unusual exercise. The side streets everywhere are still in a very bad state, both in this city and Brooklyn, and miles of sidewalks are still covered with drifts, through which the occasional wayfarer is compelled to flounder shoulder high. Broadway in New York has been partly cleared from Madison Square to the Battery and all the principal avenues will soon be opened if no more snow comes along. In Brooklyn, Fulton Street has been partly cleared for miles. One of the Chief Inconveniences arising out of the present situation is the want of milk. The supply of fresh milk gave out long ago and there is reason to fear that the supply of condensed milk will not last much longer. A great many households, too, especially among the poorer classes are suffering for want of coal. There is plenty of meat and flour, so that the city is not likely to suffer from starvation, even if another snowstorm should befall it. But the improvement in business in general is very slight. The retailers, of course, find plenty of customers, but the big wholesale men who depend on the mails, the telegraphs and the railroads for their transactions are helpless. The tangle of telegraph wires is almost as bad as ever, and it is difficult to communicate even with neighboring towns. Staten Island Blockaded It is impossible to get any word from the interior of Staten Island and the amount of the damage done by the storm cannot be ascertained. It has been learned that three trains on the Rapid Transit road are snowed in at Annandale, about ten miles from Stapleton, and the passengers are being cared for at an inn. Several calamities on the water are reported. The ferry boat Maid of Berth was sunk at her dock at Staten Island, but all the passengers were saved. Alex Bennett, John Leo and another employee of the Singer company, at Elizabethport, were lost in crossing Staten Island Sound on Monday afternoon. Nailed Without Cargoes The wires between this city, Sandy Hook, Quarantine, Fire Island and the Atlantic seaboard are down, and marine news is obtained with great difficulty. The belief is that a number of wrecks occurred on the coast during the blow, but on account of the loss of the wires nothing definite can be learned. The North German Lloyd steamer Lahn sailed today for Bremen without cargo, as it was impossible for shippers to deliver freight. She had only forty passengers on board. There were a hundred others booked, but they are snowbound and could not get here. The steamers France and Britannic, which should have sailed today, will sail tomorrow. Like the Lahn, they will go without cargoes. Sarcastic Sympathy, Mayor Hewitt has received several despatches from points in Dakota and one from St. Paul expressing sympathy with the blizzard sufferers of New York and tendering aid.

"18880320","T. Ritchie, president of the Local Government Board, introduced the Local Government bill for England and Wales. An important feature of the proposal is the division of the whole country into urban and rural districts, within which women rate-payers will be equally entitled to vote for members of the councils. London will be created a county by itself under a lord-lieutenant. The metropolitan board of works will be transformed into a council. The city will lose all administrative duties, and the whole police force will remain under the charge of the Home Office. Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol, Bradford, Nottingham, Hull, and Newcastle will also constitute counties in themselves. Mr. Gladstone called attention to the entire absence in Mr. Ritchie's statement of any reference to Ireland. It was obvious, he said, that both Ireland and Scotland were specially excluded from the bill. Regarding the proposals now presented for England, there was every disposition on his side to treat them in a broad and candid spirit. (Hear, hear.) The proposals were too large to be criticized at once. The house must retain absolute liberty of judgment both as to the bill as a whole and as to the details. (Hear, hear.) Leave was therefore given to introduce the bill. The Citizen in Britain. London, March 19. What is already known as the American blizzard has prevailed for two days past in the north of England. The telegrams from the north are almost as full of facts about snow ploughs, blockaded trains, deaths from exposure, etc., as if they were dated in Dakota. All the roads and railways about Sunderland are blocked. Seventeen trains are snowed up between Berwick and Newcastle. Seven feet of snow lies in the Durham roads. The Flying Southern is snowed up at Morpeth, and for a time railway communication in the north is entirely suspended. Sheep have been frozen by hundreds and many people have been injured or killed by the storm, which, in many sections, in Westmoreland in particular, is the worst ever known. Some English etymologists working at the derivation of the word blizzard have concluded that it comes from the German blitz (lightning). The journal Notes and Queries claims its English nationality, as the word has been known in the midland counties for 150 years in its present form, or as ""bliz,"" ""er,"" or ""blis-bom,"" and as an oath, ""May I be blizered,"" which is common.

"18880321","D. McGibbon, advocate, of this city, who returned from New York City on Monday, Mr. McGibbon left Montreal on Sunday afternoon, March 11th, and was one of the passengers on the Montreal express which telescoped the Chicago train at Dobbs Ferry, twenty miles from New York. Mr. McGibbon said the accident appeared to be the result of criminal carelessness on the part of the New York Central officials and the serious results of the collision were utterly inexcusable. The accident occurred about 7 a.m., and at about 10 an engine and one car started south. In half an hour the train came to a standstill at Mott Haven, further progress being impossible owing to the frightful blizzard prevailing. Mr. McGibbon and several other venturesome gentlemen left the train and ploughed their way on foot through the blinding snow to 138th Street and 3rd Avenue, where after much difficulty they secured an express driver who agreed to drive them to 42nd Street. ""I have never seen such a snowstorm in Canada,"" said Mr. McGibbon. ""The drifts were immense and the wind, blowing across the island at the rate of over 60 miles an hour, punctuated the trip at each intersecting street in a very disagreeable way. Dozens of abandoned surface cars, cabs, sleighs, vans and other vehicles impeded the avenue and several times we saw pedestrians actually unable to extricate themselves from the drifts. Signs and awnings were flying on the wind in all directions. It occupied nearly three hours and when we finally reached the Murray Hill Hotel, we were nearly exhausted, being lightly clad and totally unprepared for such inclemency. My fellow passengers who remained at Dobbs Ferry did not reach New York till Tuesday evening. The city was completely paralyzed by the storm. Tram cars were stopped, the Elevated railway ceased running, hackmen wanted $50 to convey one any distance, and a general suspension of business supervened. The courts were closed; the Stock Exchange adjourned for the first time in its history; only two theatres were open on Monday night. One Elevated train became stalled midway between 10th and 17th Streets on the 6th Avenue line, and the passengers, unable to reach a station, were for four hours in the cars, which became colder and colder every minute. The native ingenuity of the American, however, came to the rescue, and a man with a long ladder placed it in position, and announced to the frigid passengers that they could descend for $1 each. A number descended, and then the fare was lowered until finally it reached 25 cents when all got down. Several of my friends were on the train and naturally feel very proud of their unique experience. The downtown hotels reaped an immense harvest on Monday night, as many merchants and others who had gone downtown early in the morning were afraid to venture home at night and paid fabulous prices for beds for the night. One gentleman told me he paid $25 for a cot in a room with twelve others. On Tuesday,"" continued Mr. McGibbon, ""the people went bravely to work, and that afternoon a few elevated cars were working. It was not till Thursday that the surface cars got started and railroad travel began. My own valise, which was checked in Montreal on Sunday afternoon, reached me on Thursday night, over four days from Montreal. In the meantime supplies of provisions were giving out, and all the hotels were furnishing condensed milk to their guests. Several sad cases of people overcome by the storm and frozen to death have occurred. The good humor of New Yorkers was never more severely tried, and it came out triumphantly. Walking down Broadway on Tuesday evening, one saw on the immense piles of snow on the street signs with such legends as 'Please keep off the grass,' 'This snow for sale,' '$100 reward for the body of Jack Frost, dead or alive,' 'Marble quarry for sale,' 'Bathing suits to rent,' etc., planted in the beautiful snow. One florist had decorated the mountain in front of his establishment with his choicest flowers, and a sign 'the flowers that bloom in the snow.' Pedestrians in grotesque costumes were unmercifully challenged by street gamins and snowballing seemed to be indulged in with impunity. Wednesday the courts got to work and the sidewalks were clear by Thursday, though the streets are frightful and the crossings dangerous. The storm seems to have demonstrated the absolute necessity for underground railways and also for underground telegraph and telephone service. In Montreal we ride over a snowstorm, but in New York they burrow through it. People were consuming the snow by means of bonfires and by steam hose, and occasionally humbler citizens would be seen pouring hot water from the domestic kettle on the ice-covered pavement. The street department of New York deserves praise, in my opinion, for their efforts, but I certainly prefer Montreal to New York in a blizzard. Before our reporter left, Mr. McGibbon said that an edict from our Police Department should be promulgated enforcing not only the removal of all snow from our sidewalks, but also the digging of a gutter at once. If this were done our pavements would be much safer than they are. MUSIC AND THE DRAMA"

"18880407","O writes, in regard to the meaning of the word Canada, that in the record of the voyages by Jacques Cartier's son-in-law, when sailing up the St. Lawrence in 1535, the two Indians being on board whom he had taken home with him, told the discoverers that the people above the Tadoussac were called Kanaiighdaze, which, being interpreted, means People of the Copper Country. My correspondent thinks those Indians came from the Bay of Chaleurs, and were, perhaps, Montagnais. The spelling of the word above is certainly peculiar and ought to be enquired into. It is an odd sight, and the sensation produced is no less odd, when two seasons of the year meet and cross each other, as is sometimes seen in our wonderful Canadian climate. As we sped the other day up the Ottawa valley, the sun shone for the first hour in the forenoon; then a blinding snowstorm set in. The hickling falls roared from the wind; the firs swayed wildly over Papineau's grave at Montebello; the bed of the Gatineau could not be seen for the drift; and we crossed the Ottawa, without any winning but the hoarse sound of the bridge. And yet through the tempest, as we flew past, the farm windows glowed with geraniums, fuchsias, and big saucy crocuses, daughters of the spring, well tended by gentle fingers, and unheeding of this last outburst of the winter's wrath.

There are quite a quantity of salesmen, but I object to being called a man. They call the fairer sex sales ladies when they toil in stores, why should not the same respect be paid to us gentlemen? Hoping that you will insert this in your valuable columns to right an INJURED GENTLEMAN. Montreal, April 11. Municipal Fires - All Fires - An alarm was sounded from box 0 at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, bringing out the section of the brigade for a fire at 70 St. Peter street, which was caused by one of the pipes bursting in the basement under the offices of the Beaver Oil Co., from which the flames quickly extended. One Babcock was used in extinguishing the fire, and the damage was very slight. At 8 o'clock in the evening an alarm was also sounded from box 142 for a fire in the rear of No. 510 Beigneurg street, which originated in the stables, spreading to an unoccupied carpenter's shop. The damage is estimated at about $300. About 12 o'clock last night the Central division were again called out by an alarm from box 10 for a fire which had broken out in the St. Lawrence school house, at the corner of St. Charles Borrommee and Dorchester streets. It appears that the fire had originated from a defective flue, and before the blaze was extinguished damage to the extent of about $500 was done. Home Affairs, Detective Glodu who pursued the eloping ex-policeman and young lady, succeeded in preventing any further romantic development of the case by bringing the enamoured girl back from New York and handing her into the arms of her parents, who are respectable and prominent Montreal citizens. FAMOUS WOMEN, It is a significant fact that most of the women who have achieved fame in art, literature, or affairs, have enjoyed vigorous health. This shows that the mind is never capable of the severe and continued application necessary to creative work unless the body is at its best. The woman who aspires to fill an exalted place among her associates must be free from nervous debility and female weaknesses. Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription will banish these, and it is warranted to restore those functional harmonies which are indispensable to health. As a specific for all those chronic weaknesses and ailments peculiar to women, it is unequalled. QUEBEC'S BRIDGE PROJECT, The Government Asked to Grant it a Heavy Subsidy, ARGUMENTS IN ITS FAVOR Met by Some Pertinent Enquiries by the Government, who Promise to Consider the Subject, (From our own correspondent) Ottawa, April 12. A large and influential deputation from Quebec waited on the Government in the Privy Council chamber this afternoon to ask aid for a bridge across the St. Lawrence from Quebec to Levis, connecting the railways on the north shore with the Intercolonial. They asked a bonus of two and a half millions, or an interest guarantee of 4 percent on four millions for twenty-five years. Colonel Rhodes, after reading the petition, said that several gentlemen, Messrs. Hearne, Andrew Thomson and others, influential citizens of Quebec, were unable to accompany the deputation on account of ill-health, although they were entirely in sympathy with the movement. In the city of Quebec there was a very strong feeling that justice had not been rendered to them. They had taken up the construction of these railway works of the country at a very early period and introduced in the country proper persons for the construction of the Grand Trunk railway. He was the only living original director of that corporation. In addition to this they had devoted a great portion of their time to the construction of these works, of so much benefit to the community at large. He did not like to use the term command, but wished merely to convey the impression that the people of Quebec considered that they might have been better treated than they had been, and they thought the time had come when justice should be rendered them. If Sir John had been remarkable for anything it was for his good feeling, he had got into more trouble through his friends than he had from his enemies. (Laughter) Sir John Macdonald I hope that you are not my friend. (Hear, hear) Col. Rhodes, continuing, said that he addressed himself to those feelings of his nature which everybody recognized in him and which posterity would not forget. One of the most disagreeable phases of Quebec in winter was that people who were brought from Europe, instead of having every facility afforded them after their long journey and their farther journey to their new homes, they were cast out to wade through the snow to meet the Canadian Pacific railway on the other side of the river. These people had to work their way across the river with their baggage in snowstorms the best way they could. This was a great hardship which could be swept away. The construction of a bridge would make this transit easy and comfortable. About 6,000 emigrants arrive weekly at New York, but their arrangements are far preferable and better conducted than those for emigrants in Canada. In Halifax he thought they were treated with humanity, but they did not receive as good treatment as they should. It was not owing to any feeling of the people against them but to the lack of proper facilities. He thought that this meeting of all the prominent business men of Quebec and vicinity, who had all come down at their own expense, was sufficient proof of the importance which the people there attached to this question and the earnestness with which they would carry out any scheme countenanced and helped by the Government. SOME PERTINENT QUESTIONS, Sir John Have you drawn up all the plans? Col. Rhodes Yes, they had prepared a plan for the construction at the point of the river which appeared the easiest to cross. It was a distance of about 4,000 feet, and was the point of the river which had always been considered as the most feasible point for the construction of a bridge. Sir John Macdonald supposed they would give some information as to the financial basis and prospects of the company. Col. Rhodes The secretary of the company has a banker's receipt for $1,000 placed to the credit of the company. They had anticipated this as a probable question. (Laughter) Sir Adolphe Caron What amount of stock has been subscribed? Col. Rhodes Six hundred thousand dollars. They had fulfilled the financial conditions required by the law. Sir John Macdonald said that he would like to know what prospects there were for raising the money for building the bridge; $21,000 would not go very far in that direction. Col. Rhodes replied that it all depended upon what assistance the province of Quebec and the Dominion Government would give them. If the Government refused to give them anything, it would kill the thing dead. If the Government acknowledges their existence, the financial world would do so likewise, and there was no doubt that bonds might be raised upon the credit of the company, and would then be favorably looked upon by foreign investors. This would give the starting character to the whole enterprise. The capital stock was $1,000,000, and $500,000 had been subscribed and 10 percent had been paid in, or $21,000. The lowest estimate for the construction of the bridge was $1,000,000. It would require all that. Cap Rouge was the most likely point for the construction as the river was not so deep there. Sir Chas. Tapper What would the river span there? Mr."

One lot of 1,100 boxes colored was taken by a shipper on private terms, which were not believed to be in excess of 11. Parties who have more stock than they know what to do with just at present concluded to take the chances of consignment and send some of it abroad for sale on their own account. Quotations are nominally 13c for old white and 13c for old colored, but there is no doubt that the latter is liberally shaded if a bona fide purchaser makes his appearance. The stock of white is so small that anyone who wants it has to pay the price, but this fact takes it out of the reach of exporters, and it sells only in a small way to the retail trade. It is claimed that old stock is being disposed of very satisfactorily, and that by the time new cheese appears in any quantity there will be no more old than the home trade needs. We hope this may be so. Home trade can use a good many of that class of goods even in June and July, but we do not believe that it will have to hunt for them with a magnifier. What is called a sprinkling of new cheese made its debut in New York last week. The best white sold at 12c in the city, while nearly as good went at 11c. New colored from Horkimer County took quite a range, part skimming selling at 8c to 10c, and full creams at 10c to 10.5c, with one lot at 11c. Weather in the country has not been particularly favorable for an increase in the make. The snowstorm of Saturday again chilled the air and retarded the flow of milk. As we look out of the window we see patches of snow and ice along the street, and we learn that the roads in the country are exceedingly bad. Judging from what we have learned during the past week we should say that factories opened on an average about one week earlier than they did last year. Establishments whose owners did not intend to open until a week or two later were spurred up to an early resumption of business because some neighbors had done the same, and some patrons might have lost by a delay of a few days. But we doubt if the supply of milk has been large on account of difficulty in hauling it. Rather more white cheese has been made than usual, but that will be corrected as the season advances. In response to our request made a week ago several factory men have written us in regard to the opening of the Utica Board of Trade. In deference to the opinions expressed by them, it has been thought best to call a meeting for organization next Monday, April 8, at 3 p.m. sharp. This will enable the board to get its routine business out of the way at an early date, so that buying and selling can be the principal business hereafter. Officers for the ensuing year will be elected next Monday, and such other business transacted as may come before the board. There will probably be some small lots of cheese offered, and buyers enough will be present to bid on them. Butter has taken a downward turn during the week, and fancy stale dairy tubs, which were selling a week ago at 27c, are now quoted at 26c, with a good deal selling at 24c. Welsh tubs sell about one cent less. There seems to be more stock offering than the market can take care of, and the urgency to sell has knocked off prices. State creamery begins to accumulate, and 25c to 21c are the outside prices obtainable. The make is large and the probability is that there will be a dragging market until new grass butter appears.

"18880426","SOCIETY TALK IN GOTHAM Some New Effects in Ladies' Dresses and Head Clear Impressions of a Recent Dramatic Success at the Lyceum New York, April 25 My last letter reached you just as we were suffering from our ever-to-be-remembered blizzard, a storm which made this great New York in very truth a beleaguered city. Streets were blockaded, supplies cut off, men separated from their families, telegraph and railroad communication denied us, and life destroyed, and all by the beautiful snow. No wonder a French paper had a notice saying a fearful epidemic was raging in America called the blizzards, and many people were dying of it. We know not how many impaired their health in trying to battle with that storm, but we do know that one of America's best known statesmen has succumbed and on Saturday was buried. I remember seeing Roscoe Conkling upon one occasion and thinking what an indomitable expression he had; it was that fearlessness in his nature which made him think he was safe in defying the elements. The grand old Kaiser is gone, the blizzard too, and Roscoe Conkling, to be followed too soon by the death of the patient, gentle and wise Emperor Frederick. How full the last two weeks have been with startling events, Spring weather alone seems tardy in approaching and makes one lose sight of the beauties in Kingsley's remarkable Ode to the Northeast wind. Easter calls for spring attire, and usually brings fitting weather with well fitting costumes. Elegant tailor-made suits are in season for spring when it is not winter, and though the sun shines warmly the wind is wintry. I was looking out of a window on Broadway, on Saturday last, when there suddenly came up a fierce snowstorm, lasting only a few moments, but long enough to see an amusing destruction and flight of much spring finery. In a moment cabs, street cars and shops were taken advantage of. The day was too cold and bright to expect rain, and few were provided with umbrellas. The new dress goods are lovely this season, and checks and plaids are seen in great variety and of every texture, and are to be had in costumes, but the more elegant ones are made of the new line Henrietta cloths combined with moire, broadcloth or silk of the same color, many with a scarf drapery crossing the front and looped low down on one side, knotted and brought up again, the waist and back drapery being polonaise and braided, but of a contrasting color. Changeable silks with pinked flounces, and many of them, the flounces, are seen. In imported dresses these silks are in startling combinations, orange and blue, green and yellow, etc., they are a revival of the old fashioned silks. Why they should have been called that I cannot imagine, unless it be that if one got shot, one's colors would be sure to get mixed. There are some daring uses being made of pink broadcloth. Whether these dresses will see daylight in the street has yet to be proved. I saw an odd wrap or street dress for a girl of 12 or 13 of mahogany brown and braided with hempen rope, common clothes line size. By the way, rope has many uses nowadays not thought of a decade ago, and plays an important part in house decoration, is ravelled into fringe, ties back curtains and makes very handsome picture and screen frames if tacked upon a common bond frame and painted with gold paint, after first sizing with glue; in fact any furniture can be ornamented with rope and painted over. Another way to do picture frames, and one I thought of myself, is to stretch a piece of coarse flowered net or embroidered muslin over a plain wooden frame, fasten into each corner a china doll, cupid or angel, or bird if you like, and color the same as the rope ones. Bonnets are presenting an improved back view, and like the new houses are front all round. In holding the new bonnets in the hand one can almost believe they could be worn either way. Bows of ribbon are placed upon the crown standing up as they did in the front a month ago, and on the top of the bonnet rests a cluster of flowers, or feathers, or lace with pretty ornaments. Hats are of every shape and material, the straws being finer than last season. One I noticed was of pink lace, having a bunch of roses so arranged as to appear standing in a bowl with a climbing rose stem going under the rim and bordering the face. Some sun shades are elaborately trimmed with feathers, in fact I have seen some completely covered. I noticed a pretty tea gown of India silk, white ground with apple blossoms and leaves, gathered at the neck, then from just below the armholes to below the waist, the skirt falling full all round, the front filled in with fan shaped flowers of soft Mechlin lace, with many ribbon bows of apple, pink and green; the sleeves were gathered at the armhole and below the elbow, and finished with a frill of lace and bows. Braiding is very popular, mixed with tinsel, and often vests, cuffs and collars of white broadcloth are covered with this handsome braiding. If the weather permitted, one might imagine summer was here from the abundance of fruit, fresh vegetables and flowers to be seen, purple lilacs abound and are sold in great bunches for 20 cents. For some time spiritualism has been much talked about, and at present the Marsh-Diss Debar case is much discussed, is one of the most extraordinary incidents of infatuation or hallucination, to give it a mild term, ever known. Mr. Marsh, a man advanced in years, a lawyer, educated and intelligent, believed implicitly in the woman who duped him, robbed him of property, reputation and reason a woman whose counsel have declared they can no longer defend her, so disgusted are they with her course, and it is said there are very grave charges of another kind to be brought against her, and she may wear a necklace more elastic than the diamonds she offers her counsel to get her out of this trouble. I know a case myself in New York of a maiden lady of the certain age of fifty or more, who was rich, luxury loving, bright and intelligent, until she became imbued with spiritualistic ideas, when a saintly man of spiritualistic calling gained such power over her that he robbed her of all her worldly goods, deprived her of the necessaries of life, and so dimmed her reason that she was willing to render up her life, too, if called upon. Monopolies are legislated against, and outrages of every character publicly exposed. May spiritualists get their deserts and their charlatanism be openly condemned and merited punishment follow. The ever popular Lyceum still holds crowded houses spellbound with its splendid society play, The Wife. I cannot tell when I have enjoyed a play more or seen such uniformly good acting by a whole company. The mounting of the play is rich and attractive, the house is unique, the dressing superb and the acting all that can be desired. In this drama more than any other I can think of, the eloquence of silence is truly experienced. I have not space to more fully describe the ultima thule of the Lyceum and The Wife. I only ask you to see for yourself this delightful play, which illustrates its many phases in life, and shows the nobility of soul possessed by true men, all that is sordid, cruel and unscrupulous in the human man and that cupid can make a brave soldier tremble when the cry of battle and the roar of cannon would be unheeded."

"18880725","THE LIVESTOCK TRADE The Favorable Anticipation of Trade Fully Realized Comment on the Improvement, with Advice to the Boys A Cautionary Note Deemed Necessary The Markets In Detail, etc. (From our own correspondent) Liverpool, July 14 The anticipations of better trade which I indulged in last week have been fully realized throughout, every market held since last Wednesday exhibiting a strong upward tendency. My cable of Monday giving 13c as current rate for top lots would be pleasurable news to the confraternity of shippers, many of whom were last year too frequently the recipients of tables advising markets low, lower, lowest. But when things are at the worst they are sure to mend, and now they look more healthy all round. Still I shouldn't like the boys to fancy this sevenpenny market is going to stay. Certainly indications point to a comparative degree of permanency, but, with the bitter experience of past years still fresh in our recollection, we cannot begin to chuckle and crow over the good times inaugurated. There's this about it, the export business in 1888 is not going to be quite as big an affair as it was previously, at least for some time, simply because the cattle are not available in Canada, and until the grassers come out and the ranch stock are sent along we shall have, I fancy, very limited offerings from Montreal. Now, what is wanted is that the boys keep their hair on, don't get excited, don't, in fact, go crazy over a couple or three fair markets, and rush into Chicago, or Boston, or Buffalo, buying up everything with kin and bone about it at 7c per lb. Let them view the situation calmly. This country is not yet on the verge of a beef famine, nor within miles of such a thing. Ireland is as full of cattle as it can hold so I am reliably informed and the continental supplies are quite up to the average. English stock is also up to the standard of past years, in point of numbers, if indeed it is not actually above it. The imports of clothed meat and mutton keep creeping up steadily, and go into immediate sale without trouble. Again, the American exports though somewhat lighter during June, have not fallen off so very much, and it's hundreds to one the present improved prices will induce the Chicago operators to have another big fly at the game. For these and other cogent reasons I would once more advise my Dominion friends to think twice before committing themselves to the tender mercies of our volatile markets. A friend of mine only yesterday shrewdly enough remarked that one couldn't tell what cattle was in Ireland, but he added with a meaning wink if they have any at all this year the present good markets will bring them out with a bang. And then you'll see how long the topping rates will stand. This is solid truth, and the next two weeks ought to prove the case either one way or another. The Danish season has just about wound up, but the tonning shipments (chiefly to London) fill the gap very effectively. One unusual factor in the sum of this season's trading has been the exceptionally cold weather, and for one or two days in June the character of the weather for three weeks past has been more like March than midsummer, and should the clerk of the weather open his July stores to us, we will hardly know how to get along with it. Only this week a severe snowstorm in Wales killed hundreds of newly shorn sheep. It seems strange, but nevertheless it's a fact. Last year our heavy Dominion cattle were sweltering here in June, and buyers were afraid to look at them. This year, we have hardly a distiller to offer, and the weather has been the most disgusting fraud ever practiced on an innocent people. LONDON and Dr. PTFonn With supplies at both these markets slightly below the season's average, our 700 Canadians had a finish look in, many of the best making the general quotation being 13c&13c for useful animals. Favored with the coolest of weather and continued activity in the Central Meat market, sellers speedily got through the heavy end of the stocks on offer, only a very few secondary and rough animals remaining at the finish. At Deptford 13.1c was current for United States cattle, some extra good Spaniards making 15c. Slow trade for sheep, and veal neglected. Lamb also quiet, and prices turned lower. LIVERPOOL AND BIRKENHEAD About 420 Canadians were shown at Stanley, the demand for which was slow to begin with, but the attendance of country dealers was strong, and resulted in a healthier competition towards the forenoon. For good well-finished animals a strong 13c was easily made, the demand from Yorkshire and other districts being particularly animated, middling classes while probably more difficult to close out participated in the brisker trade, and by one o'clock a clearance was reported. At Birkenhead with very little fluctuation, prices have kept up to 12c&12c for bodies, the enquiry on London account being still strong enough to keep local buyers up to the scratch. With only very moderate arrivals due within the next ten days, this condition of affairs will no doubt be maintained. The only fly in the amber is the miserably low prices current for offals, hides and fat. The very best conditioned bullocks will hardly offer 10c per lb. If hides would only rise in sympathy with the appreciation on beef, business at the fairs would be a positive pleasure but there always is an if and I guess will be to the end of the chapter. Animated trade for all kinds. Best beef, 63c to 65c. Sheep and lambs easily changed hands. Mutton, 7d to 8d per lb. Lambs 2c to 3c each. Numbers cattle, 1,700; sheep, 8,686. Comparative numbers and prices, 1687: Cattle, 1,404; Sheep, 7,000."

No sales were reported. THE STATE OF TRADE. Trade has pursued an even and regular course on the whole, and has presented no new or untoward features to attract attention. In the leading lines the distribution has been fair, although in some quarters the broken state of the weather has been counted as a drawback. Payments have been met as promptly as was expected, and the agricultural produce of the country has been fairly satisfactory both in quantity and value. There should be an average circulation of money in the country. Merchants here, however, although reporting trade fair are not disposed to extend more credits than can be avoided, to which effect country debtors have been warned in several cases. The dry goods trade has been moderately active, and the travelers out on the sorting-up trip have done fairly well. The cotton question has been attracting considerable attention, and the differences between the various mills create more or less discussion. Meantime, the cotton goods market remains in an unsettled state. The Winnipeg Commercial says: Last week did not show any improvement in trade activity, but rather the contrary. This was owing to the unfavorable weather, which was certainly of such a nature as to put a damper on business activity. Several days' rain, followed by a heavy snowstorm, put the roads in a bad state and made traveling very uncomfortable. The natural result was that all business that could be postponed was left over until it could be transacted with greater comfort. Changes in prices were few and unimportant, with the exception of the hardware and metal branch, which continues to show appreciation in values. Iron and Hardware. The firm tone previously noted in the iron and hardware trade has been fully maintained, with prices at a full level. Practically the season for direct imports is over, and as the stocks carried are light, largely owing to the increased carrying charges arising from higher duties, the prospects appear to indicate that prices will be higher this winter. Trade this season has been well up to the average in all lines. Pig iron has ruled firm as quoted, with warrants in Glasgow cabled at 41s. Bar iron is firm at $2.10. Sheets have advanced $2.80 for 20 gauge and heavier, while thinner is quoted at $2.40. Tinplates are steady at $4.25 for 1. BY THE WAY.

Rush, of Clifton Place, Niagara Falls, one of the oldest and most respected citizens of the Niagara peninsula, passed away this morning in the 70th year of his age The deceased was owner of the Clifton House Mr. Rush came to this place from New York State and prior to taking up his residence here he had been in the New York State Assembly The Queen of the Atlantic Runs Down a French Steamer, Cutting Her in Pieces New York, November 11 The queen of ocean racers, the Cunarder Umbria, collided with the Fabre line steamer Iberia about four miles off Long Beach hotel, just beyond Rockaway, on Saturday afternoon, at 1:10 o'clock The Iberia was badly damaged, having her whole stern cut off The Umbria, after taking off the crew of thirty men from the disabled vessel and lying by all night, came to her dock this morning for repairs When she left the Iberia the latter was sinking badly at the stern, and it looked as if she would go to the bottom before noon As to the Umbria she was but slightly injured and came back to her dock merely as a precautionary measure All the marks she bore of the ugly wound she gave the Iberia was a queer triangle ragged edge hole in her collision bulkhead in its largest dimension about six by three feet The hole is just abaft of the extreme bow and at its lowest point about five feet above the water line This is on the starboard line A small hole through which a swallow might fly was also punched in the plate on the port side directly opposite The hole appeared to have been made by the revolving screw of the Iberia Glory of the Collision The story of the affair, as told by Vernon H. Brown, agent of the Cunard line, as he got it from Capt. McMicken, is as follows: The Umbria left her dock on the North River on Saturday morning, November 11th, at 10:46 o'clock, with 216 cabin, 62 intermediate and 420 steerage passengers and a full cargo of about 1,000 tons of general merchandise Sandy Hook was reached at 12:12 p.m., and the pilot left at 12:30 without incident The weather was hazy and was growing thicker all the time At 1:10 the engines were slowed up on account of the thick fog, and about five minutes later a steamer's whistle was heard on what appeared to be the starboard bow Captain McMicken was on the bridge at the time and whistled back in response As the sound of the whistle seemed to be growing nearer the Umbria's engines were stopped altogether At almost the next moment a strange steamer was seen moving directly across the Umbria's bows, heading northward The Umbria's engines were immediately ordered reversed at full speed, but that did not prove enough to neutralize her in any way, and she struck the stranger on the port quarter, carrying away a portion of the stern Orders were immediately given to lower the boats and to make an examination of the Umbria, which was done with the result as above mentioned Meanwhile the two steamers drifted apart and lost track of each other for twenty minutes The wheel of the Cunarder continued to turn with its reverse motion and soon brought her back to the crippled stranger The First Officer Guillot, of the crippled steamer, then got on board He said the name of his ship was the Iberia of the Fabre line, Capt. Sunglog The Iberia had sailed from the Persian Gulf on September 21st with a cargo of dried fruit, hides, coffee, etc. There were thirty men in the crew, including the officers The Iberia had met with an accident to her machinery and had been laying to making repairs for about thirty hours She had just got under way when the accident occurred The Iberia was a steamer of about 1,000 tons register and belongs in Marseilles, France Being in the middle of the day there was great excitement among the passengers on the Umbria The blowing of the whistles of the stranger had put everybody on the qui vive, when the Iberia loomed out of the fog the excitement was intense among the 700 passengers and but a few moments elapsed before the collision itself occurred Running at Full Speed The Umbria will likely continue her voyage at noon tomorrow Several of the saloon passengers left her to spend the day and night ashore and will go aboard again in the morning The passengers are almost unanimous on a point that flatly contradicts what the Umbria's officers say regarding the speed of the vessel at the time of the collision Some of them say that she was going at almost full speed The Umbria Wholly at Fault James K. Flwell, to whom the Iberia was consigned, was seen at his home tonight The captain of the Iberia, said Mr. Flwell, says that the Umbria was running at the rate of seventeen miles an hour She came upon the Iberia almost without warning and struck her on the port side left She cut clear through and came out on the other side The after part of the vessel, which was about one-third of the ship, was swept away out to sea and sank, no one knows where The remainder of the ship stayed afloat, owing to the presence of two air-tight compartments in the bow Two anchors were thrown overboard to hold the vessel, or half of her rather, from drifting away That part is probably sunk by this time I am unable to get at the exact facts owing to my inability to speak French, but I understand that the Umbria is wholly at fault Don't Feel With Dynamite New York, November 11 Hugh McKeever, a quarryman at Verplancks, last night celebrated Harrison's election by exploding dynamite cartridges at a safe

out of the door, but it struck against the woodwork and fell into the room McKeever ran into an adjoining room where his two children, Hugh, aged 13, and Lizzie, aged 11, were sleeping He threw himself on the bed and covered his head with the bedclothing When the cartridge exploded it tore out the front and rear of the house, demolished the doors and windows, and badly wrecked the furniture

BREAKS ARE PRESSING And Parliament Should Enter the Wedge of Land Purchase and so Enrich Landlords, London, November 19. In the House of Commons this evening Mr. Madden, solicitor general for Ireland, in the absence of Mr. Balfour, who is ill, brought in the bill to further facilitate the purchase by tenants of land in Ireland, by adding £500,000 to the amount applicable under the Ashbourne Act. Mr. Madden, in explaining the proposed measure, described the Ashbourne Act as a great success. There had been 14,338 signed agreements for the purchase of land, of which 8,032 had been completed. There were only two courses open to the Government: one was to abandon the scheme of land purchase, and the other was to extend the Act. The fact that the Act had been a conspicuous success justified the Government in seeking to enlarge its operations. Gladstone's Counter Proposal. When Mr. Madden had finished, Mr. Gladstone arose. He was received with prolonged cheers from the Opposition. Mr. Gladstone moved the following amendment to the Government proposal: ""That in lieu of voting £500,000, it is expedient, in view of the lamentable suffering arising from recent evictions in Ireland, to extend the land law of 1887 so as to empower the courts to reduce or cancel arrears of rents that are found to be excessive."" A Drench of Faith. He complained that the Government has broken their pledge to the House, after obtaining the whole command of the time at the disposal of the members under engagement that no controversial measures should be introduced. Here was a bill of the utmost importance, challenging discussion. It was submitted with the threat that it would be put forward daily until it was settled. His protest was equally against the mode of presenting the bill and the method in which its discussion was to be pressed. His amendment did not strike at the Ashbourne Act, nor would it necessarily stop its operations. He did not desire to stop the operations of the Act, whatever he might consider its dangers, and he did not oppose the bill because it proposed to keep the bill alive, but he objected to it because of the amount demanded. The Government ought to have asked Parliament for a limited grant which would suffice to enable them to continue the operations of the Act until the spring, when Parliament could reconsider the whole matter. The Opposition would cheerfully agree to such an advance, but the Government, instead of taking that course, produced a bill involving Parliament in a fresh approval of its land purchase policy. (Cries of ""Hear, hear."") The Entering Wedge of Land Purchase. Mr. Gladstone continued, stating that it was the manliest design of the Government to withdraw the subject of Irish land from the view of Parliament for several years. (Cheers.) That was not the course which could be allowed. The Opposition was not insensible to the value of land purchase. He did not desire to see the landlords or any other class removed in a body. He wanted to see them not less, but a great deal more, Irish than they were and to see them resident instead of absentees. The principle of the previous land Act was totally different from the Ashbourne Act, under which £6,000,000 were obtained, apparently as a precedent for another £5,000,000, thus drawing the House by slow degrees into a system from which there was no escape from putting the land into the hands of the State, making the State the immediate landlord without proper guarantees. A Powerful Argument. How different was the proposal from the Liberal side, when Mr. Trevelyan laid down the principle that the Government should not ask the national taxpayers to advance purchase money unless the taxpayers in Ireland evinced confidence in the tenants by offering local guarantees. He (Mr. Gladstone) had always objected to the Ashbourne Act as giving the initiative of purchase to the landlord, whom he considered second, as the peasants ought to have the initiative. If an Imperial guarantee was ever given for the purchase of land in Ireland, the security must convey a moral certainty to the Government. (Cheers.) What reason has the Government for refusing with such tenacity to deal with the arrears? Were they the means of ensuring the servitude of the tenant? (Parnellite cheers.) It was certain that this bill would give the landlords a leverage to bring up rents, while it would enable only a handful of tenants to acquire holdings. Certainly it would assist the Government in their land purchase scheme. But under what inadequate and precarious security for the repayment of advances? Doubtless the Irish tenants could be praised as scrupulous in the payment of fair rents, but if another collapse of agricultural prices occurred the farmers might be unable to pay their installments under the bill. The Government were not justified in relying upon the tenants' will to pay, after the recent declaration of Lord Salisbury, that the majority of 3,000,000 in Ireland were bent upon putting down the minority of 2,000,000 in order to get at and rifle their pockets. (Cheers.) If Irishmen had no respect for the pockets of their countrymen, were they likely to respect the English Exchequer? Were those who have been thus described by the head of the Government the people to be trusted as debtors of the State? (Laughter and cheers.) The Arrears Question Pressing. This land purchase had no immediate claims to the character of the arrears question. The tenants themselves had urgently demanded a settlement of arrears. A similar necessity had been acknowledged in the case of the crofters of Scotland. Much greater had been the need of Ireland, where the arrears were running without limit and led to a paralysis of the farmers' engagements and an unceasing flow of evictions. Evictions upon arrears prevented the tenant from obtaining the benefit of judicial rent. (Hear, hear.) The arrears were thus a weapon against the tenants, defeating and annulling the land law which had been passed for their benefit. (Hear, hear.) They made the landlords masters of the land Act and masters of the conditions for the sale of the land and the fortunes of the tenants. If the Government had the tenants' welfare earnestly at heart, instead of supporting the landlords; if they meant to relieve the distressed tenants, they would deal with arrears instead of pressing a dangerous measure which provided machinery for preventing a reduction of rent and which afforded facilities for augmenting rents and multiplying evictions with all their horrible incidents. He asked the House to intervene and prevent a recurrence of mischief, too certain to ensue, perhaps on a greatly augmented scale, under the Government's policy. Let them do justice to Ireland in the matter of arrears. (Cheers.) The Government, Mr. Goschen, Chancellor of the Exchequer, denied that the Government were pledged not to introduce controversial measures during the winter session. Mr. Gladstone's statement that if the Government had asked just sufficient to keep the Act in operation till the next session it would have been granted, was incorrect. Steps were taken to ascertain whether such a proposal would be acceptable and the response did not encourage the attempt. (Hear, hear.) The immediate extension of the Ashbourne Act was a necessity. It was desired by the tenants, and he hoped the House and the country would perceive that they were dealing with the land purchase which was not incompatible with dealing with arrears. The Government was prepared to deal with arrears in due course of time. (Hear, hear.) The suggestion that they were practically assisting the landlords in a conspiracy to allow the arrears to continue and to encourage evictions was so absurd that it was scarcely worth answering. (Cheers.) O'Brien's Prophecy. Mr. O'Brien maintained that the bill would make rich tenants richer, but would leave poor cottiers in the west in as bad a position as ever. It was merely a plan to shovel English gold into the pockets of the Irish landlords. Mr. Campbell-Bannerman (Liberal) severely censured the manner in which the Government were thrusting the bill upon the House. Before proposing the extension there ought to have been a select committee to inquire into the working of the Ashbourne Act. Rents Difficult to Collect. The report presented to Parliament by the Irish Land Commission states that Irish church property has depreciated considerably owing to the difficulty experienced in collecting rents and the unsettled condition of the country. The Commission urges that the time has arrived for a definite settlement of the question of liabilities with respect to church property."
"18881127","I, awrene There is something very impressive about the aspect of Commissioners street at the close of the season of navigation A reporter walked along the rampart yesterday afternoon in the face of a bitter easterly wind, loaded with sleet and hail, and he felt something of the sensation which a visitor to the ruins of Pompeii must experience The inclemency of the weather seemed to add to the desolation of the scene A few men, looking exceedingly nipped up and out of their element, were stamping their feet outside a saloon to induce their sluggish blood to circulate The sidewalk was as slippery as a skating rink, and the east wind appeared to be in possession, only an occasional pedestrian entering into opposition with it and endeavoring to beat up in the direction of Hochelaga The road was in a simply deplorable condition, and it occurred to the reporter that a handy thing in this exposed neighborhood for carters to carry would be a small anchor, so that when they left their drays they could prevent them from being blown away bodily The glorious rattle of the steam winches has departed; the good, stalwart loud sounding oaths of the stevedores are heard no longer on the wharves, the incomprehensible and mild objurgations of the carters having taken their place; the cries of the longshoremen at work are silenced; the screams of the tugs, the loud groans and bellowing of the ocean steamers, and the clatter of sharply shot iron all, all have departed The wharves have something sepulchral about them There is still a large quantity of freight littered about the wharves waiting for clearance, but the men working among it seem subdued, as if they were at work among the catacombs of Paris They still swear from more force of habit, but it is in a suppressed, halfhearted sort of way, as if they were merely endeavoring to appear cheerful under discouraging circumstances The weather gears said yesterday that the speed of the wind was 72 miles per hour, but along Commissioners street it must have greatly exceeded this A good half-mile of solid ice extended from the wharf out into the river, which is rapidly increasing in volume Beyond the ice line the water ran at a great rate, lapping foam-tipped under the Victoria bridge, which stood out, mist clad, gray and desolate From present appearances the surface of the river will freeze over rapidly, and those wishing to enter Paradise this season by this gate will have to make their arrangements with some dispatch The ice in the canal is an inch thick already, and there are a few barges still unloading, which will have to be cut out before they can proceed to Boucherville A few schooners have also been caught at the Hochelaga end of the harbor, and it is very probable that they will have to remain here during the winter The work of taking down the sheds on the wharves is being pushed as rapidly as possible, and if the weather is favorable for the removal of the freight, they will all probably be taken away by next Saturday The apertures in the dyke are being closed up by the corporation, except where it is necessary to keep them open to allow the carters to go down to the wharf to clear away goods In another week the silence of the grave will reign along Commissioner street It is Jack Frost's turn now, and he is having a great time THE STREET RAILWAY And How it Was Affected by the Snowstorm A Complaint Against the Head Department The snowstorm has demoralized the street railway traffic, and the company were running four horses to each car yesterday It was hard to get a car all day The officials of the company complain that their efforts to keep their Notre Dame street line open were thwarted by the Road department sending out its snow plough, completely covering their tracks, and effectually stopping the street car traffic after 4 p.m. On that line, as many as 6 cars at a time were to be seen unable to contend against corporation snow ploughs, passengers in the cars having to walk Their expressions of disgust and annoyance against corporation and company were anything but complimentary The worst of the above action is that the public are more the victims than the company P. D'Auteuil, dry goods dealer, St. Joseph street, St. Roch, has failed, with liabilities estimated at $35,000 to $40,000, and assets placed at $50,000 Toronto Has It, Too Toronto, November 26 There was a severe snowstorm here this morning and the streets have been in pretty bad condition all day The storm drums are up over the lake signal over all Eastern Ontario Several trains were badly delayed In addition to being a fighter, Joe McAuliffe is something of a sprinter While in training for his meeting with Conley, he ran three trials at 100 yards, and made the distance in 11.5, 11.6, and 11.7 A BREACH OF PRIVILEGE An Irish Member Served With a Summons in Parliament A Scene, And an Enquiry Ordered London, November 20 This evening the House of Commons went into committee, and the debate on the Land Purchase bill was resumed Mr. Parnell proposed an amendment to the effect that no money be advanced for the purchase of more than one holding if such holding were rated at not less than £20 yearly He urged that the adoption of his proposal was necessary in order to provide for a useful distribution of the parliamentary grant The sum ought to be husbanded and used as far as possible to establish a genuine peasant proprietary Mr. Balfour BaeU Again, Mr. Balfour replied to Mr. Parnell This was his first appearance in the house since his sickness, and when he rose to speak he was loudly cheered He contended that Mr. Parnell's amendment, if adopted, would interfere with the smooth working of the plan of sale The men who had various holdings were, as a rule, the flower of the tenantry They were thrifty, energetic farmers who saved money for the purpose of land investment It would be unwise to exclude these men from the benefits of the act Besides it was a great convenience to both the landlords and the tenants when an estate was sold as a whole Mr. Caston contended that unless the amendment was accepted a new class of small landlords would be created, giving trouble in the future A Breach of Privilege At this point David Sheehy, member for South Galway, a Nationalist, stopped the debate, appealing to the chairman on a question of privilege He stated that he was leaving the house when an attendant handed him what appeared to be an ordinary visitor's card Upon going into the lobby a constable from Ireland served him with a summons under the Coercion act He moved to report progress in order to give the house an opportunity to discuss this audacious breach of privilege The Chief Secretary not Responsible Mr. Balfour deplored the incident and did not know under what authority it had happened He entirely disapproved of such measures occurring within the precincts of the House (Hear, hear) Sir William Harcourt held the Government responsible for the instructions which had been given to the constable serving the summons The dignity of the House was affronted by it and an enquiry was, therefore, necessary Mr. Balfour disclaimed responsibility for the act and stated that he would give an emphatic pledge that so far as the Irish executive was concerned the incident would not occur again An Inquiry Ordered John Morley proposed that a committee be appointed to inquire into the circumstances of the incident Mr. Smith consented and a committee was appointed, including Sir William Harcourt, Mr. Morley, Sir Charles Russell, Mr. Parnell, Mr. Timothy Healy, Home Secretary Matthews, Mr. John Hume, Mr. Madden, Sir Edward Clarke and Sir Matthew Ridley A vote was then taken on Mr. Parnell's amendment and it was lost by 154 to 111 MANY DISASTERS AT SEA Terrible Loss of Life off the New England Coast New York also Suffers In the Rescue Boats Many from Death The storm which we in Montreal experienced on Sunday night and all day yesterday was felt more or less over the great portion of the continent, in fact from Nova Scotia to Florida, and may be put down as one of the most severe introductions to winter for many years The observations of the wind at McGill observatory show that the gale blew at an average rate of sixty miles an hour, with a few gusts at the rate of seventy-three miles to the hour Luckily the temperature was high, or the storm would have been unbearable; as it was, the rain and sleet of the latter part of the day was enough to make the average man grumble The heavy fall of snow brought out the sleighs, and the streets began to present quite a wintry appearance The effect of the storm on navigation was marked, and the whole passage between Montreal and Quebec is obstructed All the basins, and for fully four hundred yards outside the wharves, the river is completely covered with a sheet of ice of considerable thickness Five small schooners have been caught, and the chances are against their departure this year The Richelieu company's boats, as well as all the other lines, have gone into winter quarters, the sheds are being taken down and a wintry condition prevails over the whole harbor All the Grand Trunk trains were more or less delayed by drifts across the track, the Delaware & Hudson, due at 1:15 p.m., not arriving till 12:25 p.m., while the Central Vermont was delayed two hours and thirty minutes, the Western from Toronto one hour and ten minutes At 12 o'clock last night the trains on the Canadian Pacific railway were all reported in on time The fury of the storm seems to have been felt more outside than it was here WHERE IS CANADA The C.

"18881129","S, November 28, The Dominion Dominion line steamer Vancouver with the English mails, due here last Saturday, arrived this afternoon. Captain Lindall reports having experienced the worst passage during twenty years on the Atlantic. He left Liverpool in a dense fog and ran into a hurricane next day. The whole voyage was a succession of gales and heavy seas. He arrived off Halifax on Sunday, but had to keep out to sea because of the heavy snowstorm and gale. Next day, Monday, he encountered a terrific storm which was succeeded by dense fog. This lifted for an hour or two this afternoon when the Vancouver ran into port. Weather Morning Experience. The steamer Worcester, which left Boston on Saturday morning and was due here on Monday morning, arrived at eleven o'clock tonight. She had an awful time and encountered the full fury of the storm, but rode it out in safety. The steamer Carroll, which left here on Saturday for Boston, made the worst passage in her history and had her first officer and a sailor washed overboard. A steamer with 2,000 tons of sugar for the Halifax refinery is now twenty days out from Hamburg. Gloucester, Mass, November 28, It is reported tonight that the bodies of two men have been washed ashore at Thatcher's Island. They are supposed to have been those of the men lost from the steamer Carroll. The United schooner Percy arrived today, bringing on board Captain Darrah and the crew of the brig Mary Pint, which foundered in the gales on Sunday night. Captain Darrah sailed from Bath on Sunday morning for Philadelphia with 225 tons of ice. The vessel was owned in Philadelphia. Provincetown, Mass, November 28, The steamer Nickerson has arrived and reports having picked up on Middle Bank today the schooner M and A Morrison, of Shelburne, NS, which had been abandoned. She was dismasted and water-logged. Only the bow and after house are above the water and her hatches are off. The fate of the crew is a mystery, but they were probably washed overboard during the gale."
"18881205","ONHON, December 4 The Hudson's Bay company's meeting today was long and unfunny. Sir Donald Smith's selection as deputy governor was confirmed. Messrs Maclean and Russell Slopheim were proposed for the vacancy on the committee. A prolonged and heated discussion ensued in which Mr. Maclean and many other speakers impugned the whole policy of the company and urged that new blood was wanted on the board to meet the altered conditions of the Northwest. A show of hands largely favored Mr. Maclean, though Mr. Stephenson is approved by the board. The result of the poll will be declared tomorrow. An Agreement Confirmed The Vancouver Coal company meeting adopted the report, and confirmed by 22 to 6 the agreement with Mr. Sosnfold for bonding the Kummio property to them for three years. Crofters for Columbia Mr. Degg, the British Columbia delegate, has again conferred with the Secretary for Scotland regarding the proposed settlement of crofters in the Pacific province. In view of the delay in appointing a parliamentary committee, ministers are being strongly urged to accept British Columbia's proposal and advance sufficient to start the Columbia settlement next spring. Emperor Francis's Thanks Vikna, December 4 Emperor Francis Joseph has sent an autograph letter to Count von Tain, the Austrian prime minister, in which he thanks from the bottom of his heart all those charitable persons who, in celebration of the fortieth anniversary of his accession to the throne, have contributed to the relief of the sick and needy. The people's action, the Emperor says, is a fresh proof of their love for himself and their attachment to the Imperial family. Emperor Francis Joseph has received an autograph letter from Emperor William congratulating him on the fortieth anniversary of his accession to the throne. He renews his emphatic assurances of personal friendship, and declares indissoluble the alliance binding the monarchs and their empires. King Humbert also sent his cordial congratulations. Finjr Millions Honey Bkhiin, December 4 The report that the Government intended to ask for an appropriation of 60,000,000 marks for field artillery became a subject for question in the Reichstag. Herr Rübtor asked whether the rumor which first appeared in the Cologne Gazette had any foundation. General von Schellendorf, minister of war, admitted that it was true, and that in view of the large artillery equipment of foreign countries an increase of the German artillery equipment was under consideration. The existing disproportion of Germany's field artillery with that of other countries must be considered. This response left the members in the dark as to what amount would be added to the budget, and has increased the distrust previously felt. Lord Lansdowne Welcomed IJoHiiAV, December 4 Lord Lansdowne, the new viceroy of India, was received with unusual ceremony on landing yesterday. In reply to the municipal committee, he contrasted Canada and India. The former was only recently settled, and was self-governed. India has an ancient and historic civilization, where modern institutions were being tried continuously and by tentative steps. He promised to increase the defenses of Bombay, inasmuch as he recognized it to be his first duty to render India secure. The Pope's Position London, December 4 The Standard Home correspondent says the French Government has secretly advised the Pope to leave Italy in the event of a rupture between France and Italy, and has offered all possible assistance. The Tribune hears that the Pope has charged Mgr. Gulimbertl to visit the Duke of Lichtenstein and thank him for his generous offer. It says His Holiness has no present intention of leaving Rome, but if Italy should become involved in war he would willingly take refuge at Vaduz. A Pressing Problem Rome, December 4 The Riforma, in referring to President Cleveland's message, approves of the suggestion that the laws relating to the naturalization of immigrants be revised. Although five years' residence was sufficient when the union did not contain 60,000,000 inhabitants, it was now insufficient. Many immigrants abuse their rights in order to escape duties toward the motherland, especially military service. This state of things caused serious inconvenience. The Spread of Socialism Hiciiwn, December 4 The spread of Socialism appears to affect even veteran soldiers' associations. Uneasy under the indications of discontent among veterans, the Emperor directs that no soldiers' associations, old or new, be authorized unless the statutes of such associations contain an article affirming attachment and devotion to the Emperor. Such associations must also exclude from discussion at their meetings all political and religious questions. Emperor William Better Bkiimh, December 4 Emperor William is reported to have completely recovered from his indisposition. It is known definitely that he has been suffering with an ear complaint. The Emperor drove out today, his first outing in ten days. The Emperor's appearance set all the false rumors, circulated by French and Austrian newspapers to the effect that his condition was serious, at rest. Are Ferdinand's Troubles Over? Vienna, December 4 Advices from Sofia say that Prince Ferdinand is seeking a marriage alliance with the Russian branch of the Oldenburg family. He hopes to solidify his position by marrying an orthodox Russian related to the Czar. A despatch from Prince Alexander of Battenberg, addressed to Ferdinand as Prince of Bulgaria, is read as foreshadowing European recognition. The Irredentist Plot Viwha, December 4 Many houses have been searched and several arrests made at Tiloatein in connection with a revolutionary plot discovered through the recent arrest at Vienna of an Irredentist suspected of having designs upon the life of Emperor Francis Joseph. The details are kept secret. Bankruptcy Court Dublin, December 4 The Bankruptcy court today refused an application for the release of the bankrupt Maroney, who was committed to prison in January 1887 for refusing to be sworn and to make disclosures regarding the disposition of money under the plan of campaign. The Mob Answered Brussels, December 4 The Queen attended the performance at the Royal Circus last night. Her Majesty was given an ovation. She expressed herself as greatly gratified by the manifestations of attachment on the part of the people. Irish Bishops Reunite London, December 5 The Home correspondent of the Chronicle telegraphs that the Irish bishops have sent a letter to the Pope announcing their full adhesion to the last Papal rescript. Cable Notes Mr. Bright's fever is increasing. The surplus in the Russian treasury for 1887 was 60,000,000 roubles. It is reported that the Russian ambassador at Teheran will be recalled. The Government of Montenegro has ordered the construction of twelve gunboats. John Bright was somewhat better today, but his general condition was not improved. Lord Balfour of Burleigh has been appointed Parliamentary secretary to the British Board of Trade. Seven actions are pending against M. Noma Gilly for damages amounting altogether to nearly 250,000 francs. Riots have been renewed at Waterford, although the priests and national leaders interfered to prevent serious trouble. It is rumored the German Government will ask the Reichstag for 40,000,000 to 50,000,000 marks to equip field artillery. It is reported that very important fortifications are being erected in Savoy outside of the neutralized zone on the Franco-Italian frontier. If the plan of campaign has collapsed on the Orr estates in Donegal, the tenants accepting the new terms as those of the Marquis of Conyngham. All of the presents given by ex-Queen Natalio to King Milan have been returned and 1,000,000 francs has been placed at her disposal in the Bank of Servia. Among the latest orders issued by the German Emperor is one prohibiting officers in Berlin and other great garrison towns, under penalty of five days' arrest, from using civilian dress when off duty. A STORM IS COMING, And we are promised a generally unpleasant day. METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE, Toronto, December 4, 11 p.m. Since yesterday a depression of some importance has moved southeast to the lakes and is causing local snowfalls and high winds. The pressure is also decreasing in Eastern Canada. In the Northwest the weather is generally fair, with moderate temperatures, except at Winnipeg, where a snowstorm prevails. Maximum temperatures: Calgary, 30; Qu'Appelle, 44; Winnipeg, 32; Toronto, 37; Montreal, 32; Quebec, 26; Halifax, 32. Warning signals are up at Lake ports and ordered up for Bay of Fundy stations. Increasing winds; cloudy, with occasional snow or sleet; a little higher temperatures. CAPITAL CHAT, A Digest of Important News Ottawa, December 4 The Canadian Pacific railway arbitration was continued today, most of the time being occupied in the cross-examination of Mr. Bell, who gave evidence yesterday. It is understood that the sub-committee of the Council to which the matter of the mail contract was referred has made a report on the subject, but the nature of the report has not transpired. Major Bell, of the Bell farm, is here en route for England, where, it is said, he will reorganize a stock company to run the farm. Two thousand acres were under cultivation this year. The crop was abundant, and rumor has it the profits of the farm were over forty thousand dollars. Judge Doherty, of the Superior court of Quebec, has been appointed deputy judge of the Court of Queen's Bench during the absence of Judge Baby. The total number of lockages on the Rideau canal at Ottawa during the past season was 1,840, of which 679 were steamers, the balance being barges, rafts, etc. Mr. Keys, of the Canadian Workman, Montreal, has had several interviews with members of the Government with reference to obtaining promises of Government assistance towards carrying out the scheme of the Knights of Labor to purchase a tract of land outside of Montreal and build five or six hundred artisans' cottages so as to relieve the congested districts. Judge Founder has, by consent of counsel, rendered judgment in the Intercolonial railway case, McGreevy vs. the Queen, awarding Mr. McGreevy $120,371. The claim was for $970,000. Mr. Curran, M."

PHYSICAL CONDITIONS The physical conditions of each country are here given in the order considered most favorable for skating. Canada Frost conditions last from four to six months; often early in December the rapid rivers and large lakes are frozen up. Before the first fall of snow the rivers and lakes give splendid skating, and even after this fall storms of wind may clear the snow from large expanses of ice. Covered-in rinks give certain, though cramped, skating for the whole winter, and races are held on those rinks. The ice is exceedingly hard and glib (slippery). SleCoemlck and Dowd train exclusively for their races, which are over distances from one to ten miles or more, and on rinks about fourteen laps to a mile. Everyone in Canada is either a figure or speed skater or both. Norway The winter is similar to Canada, though not as severe or prolonged, nor are there such severe snowstorms; still, skaters can depend upon getting about two and a half months or more of continuous skating on swept courses or covered rinks. Before the first fall of snow the lakes and fjords give grand skating, and the fjord of Christiana, which is constantly swept, affords skating generally throughout January and February. Thaws at the end of the winter often melt the snow and again lay bare the ice, to the delight of the skater. Paulsen and Hagan carefully train for their races, and are picked men of a skating people. The courses are generally curved, about four laps to one mile, and the distances vary from one to twenty-five miles. If the races are held on the fjord of Christiana, the course is often much longer. Inland fresh water ice is very hard, but the salt fjord ice is not so hard, but still is good going. Holland The Dutch are favored with about three weeks or a month's skating, but, as in England, it varies very much in different years. When snow falls to any depth, courses are swept for the traffic along the canals and rivers, making the whole country always accessible to the skater. Almost every village of any size has an open rink constantly kept swept. Van den Berg and Klngma, unlike the Norwegians and Canadians, do not carefully train, but doubtless when there is much skating get into good, hard condition. They are picked men of the greatest speed-skating nation in the world, but their races, as before mentioned, being only over short distances, such as 176 yards, only short distance men are brought out. The ice is generally hard and glib (slippery), though at times soft from the influence of snow. England Has an average of ten days' skating, sometimes even a fortnight, and once in seven or eight years fourteen days' continuous skating, as in 1870, though often, as last winter, not more than two or three days together, and that at intervals of weeks. Hmiirt and See are picked men from the Fens, which is the only district in England where speed skating is practiced, and has a population of about 20,000. They leave their agricultural work to race with hardly a day's practice. Ice being usually not frozen at low temperatures is not hard and glib as in other countries, and this softness makes very fast ice rarely possible. Nonetheless, the men are, from their outdoor work, in hard condition, and when they have a few days' practice get into good going order. The racing distance is generally one mile and a half, twice up and down a straight reach of 600 yards. SKATES The little I know under this heading I will give under Remarks on skates, as I feel it is impossible to touch upon style when there is so little knowledge of the two essentials, viz: Motion of skaters and length and shape of the stroke as cut on ice or in thin snow. Instantaneous photographs have been taken of most sports, but none, I believe, of skating, except indeed, one or two rather indistinct ones by Mr. Sidney Tobin. It is to photographs alone we can trust to give us the exact motions. Unfortunately, instantaneous ones require a good deal of preparation, and not something if well done, still I hopefully look to some public-spirited persons in each country to remedy the defect. Who shall get the credit of being first? At pages 110 and 111 of ""Kent skating,"" by N. and A. Goodman, twelve views of skating are given which, when put in a praxinoscope, or wheel of life, fairly represent the motions of English figure skaters. Measurements and drawings of strokes are so easily taken that I cannot help thinking, so my active mind must have taken them in most countries. I have only one or two of English strokes. If possible, measurements should show where the outside edge, the flat of the blade, and the inside edge begin and end."

The cancellation of twenty-seven ranch leases and the return to Government control of 700,000 acres of grazing land, because the holders failed to fulfill the conditions, will rob the Opposition press and speakers of a favorite and much used grievance. Never in history has a champion of the Protestant faith laid such a trio of defenders as L'Elmilard, Justice, and T. Varnite. Job Rhodess' candidature will make the Megantic campaign memorable. Only Mr. Mercer could have picked out a Protestant to win such support. Everything Attorney-General Martin undertakes to do seems to miss connection. His application to the Privy Council for permission to cross the Red River with his railway bridge failed for the time being, because he did not have his plans to hand. The only thing he seems to do well is to tell whoppers and get himself exposed. It is a bad sign for the Floquet ministry that the anger of the duped Panama Canal shareholders should be turned against the Parliament. Eight hundred and eighty thousand people with an idea that their representatives have done them a wrong constitute a force before which something must go, and the something to go in a French crisis is generally the government of the day. The weather reports from the Gulf yesterday are an effective answer to the visionary propositions for the winter navigation of the lower St. Lawrence. A mass of close packed ice, a blinding snowstorm and a northeast gale with a dangerous shore a few miles off on either bow are dangers that a ship may brave and pass, but the risk to human life they constitute is too great to be undertaken for the sake of the profit on ordinary mercantile transactions.

(Walter Hired, Montreal) THE WINTER CARNIVAL. A Party from the Isle of Wight. The original programme A severe blizzard postponed. The secretary of the Carnival committee is receiving a huge number of applications from persons in England and other parts of the United Kingdom requesting information regarding the Carnival. This is the first time in the history of the Montreal carnivals that such widespread interest has been manifested in the event. Montreal will soon become the winter resort of all countries, and instead of the world and his wife imagining it to be a place of horrors in winter, they will flock here to enjoy Jack Frost in his perfection. A large party is being organized in connection with the Royal Yacht Club of the Isle of Wight, and arrangements will be made with the Allan Line or the Canadian Pacific Railway to enable the intending visitors to ""do"" a Canadian winter. It is expected that the official programme of the Carnival will be issued on Friday next. A special meeting of the executive committee will be held on Wednesday evening at the Windsor for the purpose of forming a committee to carry out the arrangements for the grand ball, which will be held at the Windsor during Carnival week. The cornerstone of the Ice Palace was to have been laid with all pomp and ceremony yesterday by the chairman of the Ice Palace committee, but the weather being so unfavorable, the ceremony was postponed until this afternoon. The snowstorm, which lasted throughout the whole of yesterday, prevented the contractors from continuing the work of erection, but directly a little cold, clear weather sets in the construction will be pushed day and night."

"18890114","Y, January 12 There are five Malay suitors in the hospital here who are suffering excruciating tortures. They were members of the crew of the steamship Sophia Joachim, which arrived two weeks ago from Calcutta. The men, according to their statements, were treated in a shockingly brutal manner by the Captain. Coming along the coast, very tempestuous weather, accompanied by blinding snowstorms, was encountered. The rigging of the vessel was frozen and its decks were coated with ice. The members of the crew, which numbered 31 when they shipped at Calcutta, were very insufficiently provided with clothing, and many of them were without shoes or stockings. The Captain, they claim, knew this but did not warn them of the possible severity of a winter voyage to this port. The men being without shoes found it almost impossible to work and told the captain so. He answered them with an oath and ordered them to their posts. They refused to obey and he caused each one to be flogged with a rope's end. They were compelled to go aloft in the frozen rigging in their bare feet. Some of them were unable to bear up, and these were starved into submission. The men's hands and feet were terribly frostbitten and the poor wretches frequently fell down exhausted on deck. They were then treated to an application of ropes and deprived of food for twenty-four hours. Some of their limbs will have to be amputated, as gangrene has set in. Barclay, under date of January DIM, 1880, in which he announces the first experience with a snowstorm of the Sprague Electric road, at operation in Davenport, Iowa. This is the most severe test from this cause which any of our roads have yet undergone, and the result is a triumphant success for the Sprague system. In this telegram Mr. Barclay says: ""Regular billiard here, which could not be worse. There are two inches to one foot of snow on the car tracks, and it is drifting badly. The Electric road is a signal success, and the cuts are running uninterruptedly.

"18890116","Ioxno, January 15, The Government has received letters from Henry M. Stanley, and his safety is assured. Those letters will soon be published, and are temporarily withheld from publication for certain official reasons not given. Of their authenticity and of the safety of the explorer there is no doubt whatever. The Vailfi Chronicle says with reference to a telegram that Mr. Stevens, who rode through Europe and Asia on his bicycle, has started to find Stanley: We may say that Mr. Stevens is now in London, having arrived by the Umbria on Saturday, and that the Government has information of Stanley's safety. Long before Mr. Stevens can reach the east coast of Africa, recent letters from Stanley will be published in London. There are meanwhile certain reasons why the exact whereabouts of the famous traveller should not be made public. The Mouvement Geographique steamer Stanley has probably brought news of Henry M. Stanley from Stanley Falls to Leopoldville. The steamer left the Falls for Stanleypool on September 7 with Lieut. Kerkhoven and the vanguard of an expedition charged with forming a camp on the banks of the Aruwimi. A message relative to Stanley left Ujiji on December 17. Bismarck In Bad Humor, Berlin, January 15, Prince Bismarck was in the Reichstag to-day, he made a speech in which he disparaged the reports recently published in the newspapers concerning the British Niger company. Count Herbert Bismarck said the matter was being arranged between the English and German Governments. Herr Lichten criticized the investigations which had been made by the Government with a view to the suppression of the slave trade in Africa. Prince Bismarck replied and took occasion to denounce the lack of patriotism displayed by the Liberal press, which, he said, was seeking to embarrass the policy of the Fatherland for the benefit of foreigners. During the debate on the expenses of the German consulate at Zanzibar, Prince Bismarck said he would not now refer to the Government's colonial policy, but would speak on the subject during the debate on the East Africa bill. Holland's Anxiety, London, January 15, Private dispatches from The Hague report that the general idea there is that King William is dying. A regency is regarded as so inevitable that a Cabinet council was held to discuss the question of calling it into immediate being. The utmost anxiety is felt about the Luxemburg succession, which will naturally devolve upon Adolph Duke of Nassau, but which it is suspected the King of Prussia may appropriate on the ground of ancient claims to the Orange heirship, which the Kings of Prussia asserted up to the time of the Pragmatic Sanction. The Duke of Nassau, who is only a few months younger than the dying King, hates and is hated in return by the Hohenzollerns quite as bitterly as the dispossessed Duke of Cumberland. A Very Unlikely Story, Tunis, January 15, The police have captured a gang of robbers and assassins. Among the members of the gang is a man who is believed to have perpetrated the revolting murders of a number of women in the Whitechapel district of London. The British consul has forwarded to his Government all the details connected with the arrests. The supposed Whitechapel murderer is charged with having committed in Tunis a murder similar to those committed in Whitechapel. The man has confessed that he recently lived in Whitechapel. The New Panama Canal, Paris, January 15, The first issue of the new shares of the Panama Canal company by the Banque Parisienne will amount to 30,000,000 francs. A second issue will be made only in case of necessity. The new company obtains all the rights and privileges of the old company, including the right to issue lottery bonds. The original holders will receive 80 percent of the net profits after the new company shall have been remunerated. The Honorable Artillery Dispute, London, January 15, A meeting of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company was held last night, when there was a large attendance. By a unanimous vote a resolution was passed demanding that the War Office institute an inquiry into the charges of insubordination. It was announced that the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Portland had resigned their membership in the company, as well as their commissions. A Truly Royal Regret, Berlin, January 15, While on a shooting excursion at Buckow today the Emperor, having by accident slightly wounded a citizen of Berlin, who was looking on at the sport, expressed his deep regret for the occurrence and begged the victim of his misdirected aim to pay him a visit as soon as he recovered from his wounds. The Mahdi's Order of Plan, Cairo, January 15, The Mahdi has countermanded his order to the Governor of Berber to leave that place with his army for the upper Nile. It is supposed the Mahdi has taken this action in consequence of defeats sustained by the dervishes in the equatorial provinces. England Propitiated, Berlin, January 15, Prince Bismarck made nine short speeches to-day, and the fact is taken to indicate anxiety on his part to avoid annoying England. The Opposition abstained from provoking the Chancellor. The Ceffcken and Morior affairs were not referred to. Weather in Europe, Vienna, January 15, Heavy snowstorms are reported in Eastern Europe. Railways in Galicia and Roumania are blocked. The river Danube is frozen solidly for a distance of 18 miles below Vienna. Killed in a Collapse, Messina, January 15, A home in the Quartier Bellamal, inhabited by Italians, collapsed today. Seven of the occupants were killed and nine injured. The building had been undermined by floods. Forty-two Were Drowned, Sigonella, January 15, The steamer Philipcket has been sunk by collision with an unknown vessel. Forty-two persons were drowned. Pithy and Personal, Mr. Dion Boucicault, nee Agnus Robert, has been granted a divorce in England. Dr. Kruss, a chemist, of Munich, has succeeded in decomposing cobalt and nickel, both of which have hitherto been supposed to be elementary substances. Mr. Michael Hicks Beach, speaking officially, said he hoped that in the coming session Parliament would turn its attention to the questions of Irish education and local government for Irish industries. Mr. Gladstone, in a letter to the rector of the Naples university, expressed his thanks for the cordial reception given him by the students of that institution. He says their greeting touched his old age with the breath of youth. The Govan election attracts more attention than any Scotch by-election yet. The Tories carried the seat two years ago by 362, but the Gladstonians are now very confident of regaining it. The Tory candidate is Sir John Pender, the well-known cable magnate, while the Liberal nominee is a local man.

"18890122","CARNIVAL NOTES: The Ice Palace The Ball The Dog and Pony Mare An Invitation to President Cleveland. The Ice Palace is growing apace. The central tower and turrets have reached the height of about forty feet, as also has the southern wall and entrance. The eastern and western walls, which were greatly emaciated with the recent thaw, are being rapidly rebuilt and strengthened in the weak points. The contractors expect to be able to work with the electric light at night when the snowstorms cease. Mr. Leslie Quail was last evening elected as chairman of the floor committee in connection with the ball. The necessary arrangements for carrying it out to a successful issue were made and will be carried out under the personal supervision of Mr. Scott. Invitations to be present have been sent to all the lieutenant-governors of the different provinces, and from present appearances there will be a large and fashionable attendance. Master Willie Ketchman, of Brighton, Out., has written to the Carnival committee accepting their offer for Carnival week, and he and his dog ""Doc"" will compete with any trotting pony under 12 hands high for a cup worth $50. It is expected that this challenge will provoke a great deal of curiosity all over the continent. A telegraphic invitation was yesterday sent to the President of the United States and Mrs. Cleveland to attend the Carnival ball. The Grand Trunk and Delaware & Hudson railways have issued lithographed hangers advertising the carnival. The Grand Trunk has also sent out a program giving the daily events and the company's excursion rates for Carnival week. FOOD FOR FLAMES: The St. Paul Our House Destroyed by Fire in Ontario. St. Paul, Minn., January 21. Shortly after 7:30 o'clock this morning, fire was discovered in the Grand Opera House. The fire originated in the gentlemen's coat room during the absence of the night watchman. At 9:20 a.m. the handsome opera house was a complete ruin. The building was erected by Commodore Davidson, and with the court block next to it belongs to the Davidson estate. The building was worth $100,000 and is fully insured. The Helen Barry company, which was to open at the house tonight, had not had its trunks and scenery carried in, and they were consequently safe. The building was so surrounded by other buildings that the fire department could not get at it. The top of the court block took fire and the extent of the damage there cannot yet be estimated. The entire fire department was called out, but the mercury was 14 degrees below zero, and the water froze almost as fast as it could be thrown upon the blazing building. The Grand block adjoining the opera house soon caught, and the occupants hastily departed. Many had scant apparel, and they suffered terribly. The occupants of the Court and Frost blocks were driven out, but it is thought those buildings will not lose much by fire, although the loss by water and smoke will be considerable. In the basement of the Opera House was an immense power room, from which heat and power for buildings for several squares around was furnished. By the fire this was shut down and the people in the different buildings were soon shivering with the cold, while those depending on the power were compelled to shut down until the steam engines would once more start up. This afternoon's newspapers were badly crippled. The opera house cost $200,000 and recently was elegantly refitted at an expense of $20,000. The insurance is $75,000. Vankirk, Out., January 21. D.

"18890126","D' BARR eV Co, 720 Craig street, Montreal It has been triumphantly proved that the Sprague system of electric railway can be successfully operated in all conditions of weather, and this last straw, which a few railroad men are making as an excuse for not giving patrons better transportation at an admitted less cost than by horse or by mule power, is gone. Through the courtesy of our agent in Chicago we take pleasure in sending you a copy of some telegrams and letters received by them from Davenport, and items from the Davenport papers. Telegram, Davenport, Iowa, January 6th, 1890, Sprague Electric Railway & Motor Co, Chicago, Chicago, IL. ""Two inches to one foot of snow on the track. Regular blizzard. Could have not been worse. Electric road a signal success. Cars running uninterruptedly. President A. Allen, of this road, and the president of another Iowa railroad, are here and are greatly pleased with the result. All the citizens and railway men are enthusiastic over the success of the road."" JOHN HOWARD, Supt, Davenport Central Railway Co. ""HURRY ALL THIS NIGHT SO FAR."" Davenport Tribune, Jan. 6, 1890, (Morning paper). ""Where are the croakers now? Yesterday morning when the rain ceased, the street and rails became coated with ice, then it was doubtful to many if the cars would be able to ascend the Brady Street hill, but they did not remain long in doubt, for the electric cars went up and down the hill at their usual speed. When the first car started over the line, an interesting pyrotechnic display appeared on the trolley wire; the passage of the current melting the ice and emitting a bluish flame. As we are likely to have a snowstorm this evening or tomorrow, our citizens will get an opportunity of judging how it operated in deep snow."" Extract from Davenport Democratic Bulletin, January 1, 1890, (Evening paper). Snow has fallen on an average by daylight 8 to 10 inches. It was heavy and damp. The wind drifted it considerably. Long before daylight, street railroad men were at work with their snow plows. It was hard work too, because of the wind, while the air was full of falling snow. It packed hard on the rails. When time for business came, the electric cars had the advantage over the horse cars, for when the former started they moved with almost their usual speed. Snow brushes pending from the platform of the electric cars cleared the rails of the snow left by the plows and scraper. DAVENPORT CENTRAL RAILWAY COMPANY, Davenport, January 8, 1890. Sprague Electric Railway & Motor Company, Chicago, IL. ""We have had a bad snowstorm, as far as street railroading is concerned, usually encountered in this section of the country, which you know is subject to very heavy snow and ice storms. Our cars made the usual time, while the horse cars ran slowly on their lines on a practically level road, and could not attain any speed even a walk all day. We naturally felt jubilant over our grand success. The president of a prominent Iowa street railway line was here today inspecting the system. He declared that it was not possible to do with horses what we did with electricity today. As we telegraphed you, our citizens are jubilant over the grand success. The wind was very strong, and blew the snow back on the track almost as fast as it was cleaned off. The only difference that we could notice in the propulsion of the cars was that, at our power plant, it took 10 percent more all day long to propel the cars. We would not have minded it had it taken 100 percent increase, we were so pleased at being able to satisfy ourselves and the public even in a blizzard. When any railroad men are in doubt when you assert to them, as you did to us, that you can operate better in a snow or sleet storm than cars propelled by horses, refer them to us, and we will only be too pleased to verify your assertions. Yours truly, Davenport Central Railway Co."

"18890206","THE CHRISTENING OF SNOW, His Excellency Bob The Hunt Ball a Resume-The Ice Palace (kimn-Order of Fancy Dress-Xlt. The second day of Carnival opened with a snowstorm, which continued till evening. Many of the tenderer visitors did not grumble much at the change of temperature. The heavy snowfall interfered not a little with the outdoor events of the day, but as these were few in number, and as the children's masquerade of the evening was the most looked-for item on the programme from the popular point of view, little harm was done. The Governor-General opened the Tuque Bleue slide and was enthusiastically bounced by the boys, and seemed to enjoy it too. The Hunt ball was the social event of the day, and perhaps of the week, and was a great success all round. The Saints had a fine tramp and an excellent evening's entertainment. All the sporting items found happy fulfilment. The chime of tubular bells was inaugurated at the Ice Palace and much enjoyed. The influx of visitors was partly delayed by the late arrival of all trains. Yesterday morning nearly all the trains were delayed and the large numbers of passengers they carried on account of snow on the track. The train from Boston at 7:25 was the first to enter the new Canadian Pacific depot, and the train from Toronto was an hour late. It consisted of eight cars. At Dalhousie Square station all the trains were filled and the one from Winnipeg was four hours late. At the Bonaventure depot the No. 3 Toronto train, forty minutes late, arrived with ten first-class cars filled to the platforms. The Hemmingford, Fort Covington and Massena Springs train of ten cars arrived on time, as did also the Central Vermont train, bringing all their quota of Carnival sightseers. The Delaware & Hudson had on three extra Wagners and seven other cars, and the train was an hour late. Last night nearly all of the trains were late, but those who did arrive were filled to their utmost capacity. Weather probabilities for today say colder. Carnival is now in full swing, and the storming of the Ice Palace this evening and the drive tomorrow may be anticipated as successes unqualified. 14 N 11 Weather, Snowing, Height above sea level, 187 feet, Barometer reduced to sea level and temperature of 10 degrees.

The evidence showed that she had enjoyed good health during seventy years of her life. She had, however, delayed a long time on the street watching the crowds of people that had gathered watching the Carnival sights. R. Bouchard stated that in his opinion she had died from congestion of the lungs, caused by exposure to the inclement weather, and the jury returned a verdict to that effect. Railway Travel. The latest snowstorm has passed completely and already its effects are pretty well got over. The railway lines are now all clear, and travel has resumed its wonted facilities.

Delegates from the Socialist revolutionary societies met at the Labor exchange today and then proceeded to the residences of Premier Floquet, M. Melino, president of the Chamber of Deputies, and M. Leroy, president of the Senate, leaving at each house a copy of the resolutions adopted by the workmen's conference at Bordeaux. The resolutions demand reduction of the daily working hours, the fixing of minimum rates of wages to correspond with the minimum expenses of workmen in each locality, prohibition of manual labor by piecework, etc. Extensive police precautions had been taken in the neighborhood of the Elysée palace and the Palais du Bourbon for fear of an anarchist riot. The services of the police were not required, however, as no disturbance of any kind occurred. The delegates declared their intention to wait upon M. Floquet and the presidents of the parliamentary bodies on February 24 to receive their replies. Similar deputations called upon the prefects of Lyons, Bordeaux, and Marseilles and presented their demands. In reply, the prefects said the Government was clearly considering many of these demands while others had no substantial foundation. The workmen said they must not expect everything to be settled by February 24. Finally, they begged the deputations to exercise their influence to avert disorder. Brutal Murder In Wales. London, February 10. Mr. Kent, landlord of the Gloucester hotel at Swansea, was killed by a burglar this morning. He retired with his wife late last night after locking all the doors, including those of his bedroom. Early this morning, the wife heard a match struck in the room and saw a negro lighting a candle. She awoke her husband and he grappled with the intruder, while his wife took a pistol from under the pillow. As it was too dark to take aim, she lighted a candle. She then fired and the negro fell, wounded in the thigh. Cursing the woman, he crept under the bed, but as she was unlocking the door, he emerged and threw a mirror at her. It missed her, but extinguished the light and the negro escaped. When she relighted the candle, she discovered that her husband's throat was cut with a razor. Kent lived long enough to describe the murderer. An alarm was raised and about noon the negro was discovered at a dry dock badly wounded and covered with blood. He is a seaman named Tom Allen. He said his motive was robbery. He concealed himself in the room before the house was closed on Saturday night. The Army Must Eschew Politics. Paris, February 8.

I rely upon the goodwill of all to obviate measures which I would adopt with regret, but without hesitation."" An Incident In Afghanistan. Moscow, February 8. The Yuzhny States that the Ameer of Afghanistan has collected 20,000 men on the frontier, with the intention of pursuing Ismail Khan. He has made futile attempts to secure the cooperation of the Emir of Bokhara in a movement against Russia. When this fact came to the knowledge of Russia, she notified England that it would be in the interest of both powers to prevent the Ameer from taking any precipitate steps. ""I Encountered a Program,"" Fain. February 9. General Boulaniger has defined that his program was the adoption of the American constitution, but with a ten years' presidency, the formation of a council of state to prepare and submit laws to a non-deliberative national council of 500 members, half to be elected by universal suffrage and half to be chosen by the provinces, and to sit only one month in the year and the granting of limited local government to the provinces. The Roman Riots. Rome, February 10. The value of the plunder secured by the mob in the recent riot is estimated at £75,000. The Government possesses evidence that the Anarchist leaders fomented the agitation. The Radicals of Milan attempted today to celebrate the revolt of 1853. They were forcibly dispersed by the police. News from Khartoum. Cairo, February 10. A report just arrived from Khartoum states that Senussi has taken El Obeid, and the Mahdi is alarmed. Envoys from the Mahdi report that another attack will soon be made upon Suakin by the Southerners. ""The March of Progress."" London, February 9. The Emperor of Japan will on Monday next, at Tokyo, publicly promulgate a constitution for the Empire. The promulgation will be attended with great pomp and ceremony. Another French Duel. Paris, February 9. Angry at a personal and sarcastic article in Gil Blas, the poet Caullulo Mendes challenged the writer, Le Blanc. They fought with swords, and Le Blanc was wounded twice on the lip. Cabinet Note. Prince Bismarck is indisposed. Gen. Kalakonkl, a Russian artillery specialist, is dead. The Cologne Gazette contradicts reports that the Czar is coming to Stettin. The report that Cardinal Lorlochowski, primate of Poland, had died at Rome was erroneous. His condition was very critical, but he is now recovering rapidly. King Humbert is certain to visit Berlin in the spring. The death of Crown Prince Rudolf is not likely to alter the arrangements for the visit of Emperor Francis Joseph in the summer. THE MODERN HIGHWAY. Items of Interest to all Connected With America's Railroads. Chicago, February 9. The new method of charging for live stock per 100 pounds, instead of per car load, which was inaugurated by the Western roads on January 1, has proved an expensive experiment. The action of the Kansas commissioners in ordering the railroads in that state to cease weighing and charge freight per car load as formerly will cause the abandonment of the scheme at all points. Orders have been issued that, owing to the refusal of the Kansas railroad commissioners to change their decision, cattle rates at all Kansas points must again be made per car load. An effort will be made to continue the weighing system east of St. Louis and between Omaha and Chicago. A Big Consolidation. New York, February 8. The negotiations between Cornelius Vanderbilt and Pierpont Morgan for a consolidation of the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis known as the Bee line, and the Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Louis, and Chicago road, called the Big Four, have been successfully closed. The officers of the Big Four desire to extend their lines to St. Louis and they find the necessary lines in the leased roads of the Bee line. The terms, it is believed, include an exchange of stock. The Agreement Cannot Stand. New York, February 9, 1889. A Chicago dispatch to the Tribune says: The feeling is gaining ground even among the presidents that the celebrated president agreement will never receive the signatures of all of the roads in interest. The Illinois Central will not sign and the Burlington will not sign without the Illinois Central. The Burlington and Northern will be such a disturbing element as constantly to threaten the life of the agreement. ROBBERY ON THE ROAD. Successful Highway Robbery In Ontario. A Tax Collector the Victim. Ridgetown, Ont., February 9. John Oliver, collector for the township of Blenheim, distant three miles from Bright, was waylaid last night about 8 o'clock by two men driving in a cutter. Mr. Oliver, who was walking and within half a mile of his home, was ordered by one of the men who jumped out of the cutter, and with a pistol held at his head told to deliver up his money. Mr. Oliver, who was unarmed, had to hand over $500 of tax he had in his possession, which he had just collected during the day. Mr. Oliver is advanced in years and not less than two hundred and fifty pounds in weight and, therefore, could not make any effort to frustrate the designs of the robbers. Mr. Oliver is one of the most highly respected gentlemen in this county. A Triumph. The vintage of 1884, Williams Extra Dry Champagne, is in market, the favorite of courts, clubs, and connoisseurs, also adopted by medical specialists as the standard of purity, dryness, and bouquet. LONDON'S VOICE OF PROTEST. Radicals Condemn the Treatment of O'Brien. A Convict's Charges Against Egan and Other Leaguers. Informer Le Caron's Testimony. London, February 10. Notwithstanding a heavy snowstorm, the demonstration in Hyde Park today to denounce the Government's coercion measures in Ireland and to express sympathy with William O'Brien was successfully carried out. Thousands of citizens, chiefly from the workingmen and Radical clubs, attended the meeting, marching to the park through the storm with bands and banners. Speeches were delivered from twelve platforms. The speakers denounced the Government generally and Mr. CIS IN THE GULF. Weekly Report of the Weather and Ice for the Past Seven Days.

WELLS, RICHARDSON & CO, Montreal, P.Q. OUR TRADE WITH BRITAIN - A slight improvement noted by January's statistics. JACK THE RIPPER CAUGHT - A wire murderer arrested at Dundee, probably the Whitechapel fiend - Australia and Canada. Special by cable to the Sun. London, February 11. British trade with Canada improved during January. The Board of Trade returns show the exports to Canada to have been £423,101, a decrease of seven per cent, as compared with January 1888. The imports from Canada were £60,447, an increase of 49 per cent. In exports the decreases are chiefly in railroad and other classes of iron. In imports flour increased £3,504, cheese £3,415, fish £10,012, and lumber £16,627. The Canadian railway discussion continues. A letter in the Times, which is attracting attention, shows from official returns that the Canadian Pacific lines in Ontario, not an integral part of the main line, have received three million dollars in subsidies while on the Grand Trunk similar lines have received nine and a half million dollars. The letter asks: For which company has the fatted calf been killed? In the Jack the Ripper case, London, February 11. The body of a woman concealed in a wooden chest was discovered today by the police of Dundee. The abdomen was ripped open and the body otherwise mutilated. The chest was so small that the murderer had been compelled to squeeze the body into it. The husband of the woman has been arrested on suspicion. A dispatch from Dundee says the murderer of the woman whose mutilated remains were found in a closet today is W.W. Bury, the victim's husband. Bury was a resident of Whitechapel, London, and his antecedents suggest that he is probably ""Jack the Ripper,"" and that he is subject to fits of unconscious murder mania. The post mortem proved that the woman had first been strangled and her body then mutilated, the abdomen being ripped open and the legs and arms twisted and broken. Bury says he left Whitechapel three weeks ago. He refuses to say why he left there. He says he and his wife drank heavily last night and he does not know how he got to bed. Upon awakening he found his wife upon the floor with a rope around her neck. Actuated by a sudden unaccountable mad impulse he seized a knife and slashed the body. Upon reason returning he became alarmed and hastily crushed the body into the chest, thinking to escape. He found he could not leave his wife's remains and finally resolved to inform the police. The theory of the police is that Bury's wife knew of facts connecting him with the East End atrocities and that she took him to Dundee hoping to prevent recurrence of the crimes. RUSSIAN LANGUAGE IN SCHOOLS - Biba, February 11. The curator of instruction of the district of Dorpat is taking decisive measures to force the use of the Russian language in the schools. All the masters of primary schools who refuse to teach Russian will be dismissed. The German private school for the children of the nobility in Courland, one of the Baltic provinces, will be closed. A Pretty Plain Warning; Berlin, February 11. Emperor William has officially notified Prince Alexander of Battenberg that he does not desire his presence in Berlin, either in connection with the settlement of the affairs of his father, the late Prince Alexander of Hesse, or on any other business. The Pope's Health Poor, Rome, February 11. At the consistory today the Pope nominated for the cardinalate Monsignor Imacchi and Donnibale and the Archbishop of Catania. The condition of the Pope's health prevented him from reading his allocution, but it will be published tomorrow. The Table Turned, London, February 11. The governments of the Australian colonies unite in inviting Canada to send delegates to Australia to consider the question of closer cable communication, instead of Australia sending delegates to Ottawa. Vienna's Awful Tragedy, Vienna, February 11. A goldsmith in this city has poisoned his five children with cyanide of potassium. After administering the poison to the children he took some of it himself, and died in great agony. The Morning in Europe, London, February 12. Severe snowstorms are reported throughout Austria and Switzerland. The storm in Germany continues. Railways are everywhere blocked and accidents are frequent. Minor and Personal, The Houdanese have evacuated Haudoub. They destroyed the town by fire. A report that the Spanish budget for the coming year shows a deficit caused a heavy fall in prices on the Madrid bourse. The anniversary of the proclamation of the republic in 1873 was celebrated throughout Spain by orderly demonstrations and banquets. The French Chamber of Deputies has approved an additional convention relative to the exchange of postal orders between France and the United States. M. Trevene, of Paris, denies that Qim Botu linger, in a recent interview, said he favored the establishment of a constitution similar to that of the United States. A St. Petersburg correspondent says he hears that the scheme of Count Tolstoi to reform the local government has been approved, despite an opposing majority in the imperial council. The resumption at Berlin of the sitting of the conference concerning Samoa will probably be delayed for several weeks, awaiting the arrival of a special commission from Washington. It is reported that leading financial houses in Paris are trying to form a new combination to complete the Panama canal. M. de Lessfins, it is said, will be merely honorary president of the new company. The Czar has declared his approval of Count Tolstoi's measures for the reform of the local government, but has ordered that they be submitted in detail to the senate for debate. This, it is believed, will result in the rejection of the measures clause by clause. ALBANI'S TRIUMPH, Toronto adds another to her mat of Canadian successes. Toronto, February 11. Madame Albani's visit here has added one more to the list of social triumphs she has scored in Canada. At quiet receptions at the Queen's hotel she has been visited by many leading citizens, including Professor Goldwin Smith. She sang tonight in the Pavilion, and met with a great reception. The house was crowded by musical and fashionable people, and their enthusiasm knew no bounds. People who heard her here six years ago and were delighted then, wondered tonight at the increased charms of her glorious voice. She will return to Toronto in a week, and is sure of such another reception as tonight's."

"18890214","I Stroud occupied the choir, and a short talk on immigration opened proceedings. Rev Mr. Lindsay considered it a question that affects the Dominion at large as well as the charities of the city. The passage money is paid as far as Montreal but no further; consequently, as the majority came without money and were unable to find employment, the great mass of them crowded the institutions of the city. Things were going to be worse, too, for the United States authorities were compelling each immigrant to pay $5, and the tide would be turned to Canadian shores. He advocated the presenting of a memorial to the Dominion Government praying them to assist poor immigrants to proceed west. Mr. Patterson admitted that the country needed the immigrants, but care should be taken in their selection and instead of being forced to remain and be a burden on Montreal, they should be helped west where they were needed. Many of those who came under his notice were of good character and willing to work, but could find no employment. The factory inspectors were introduced and explained the working of the Provincial Factory Act of last year. They had only been some three months at work; however, their opinions could not have that weight which a full year's observations would give them. The provisions of the act as affecting the labor of women and children were then read and commented on. The act was compared favorably with that of Ontario. The inspectors were almost always well received by employers, who indeed evinced a pleasing readiness to do all in their power to fulfill the letter as well as the spirit of the act. When the inspectors started on their work, they found the water-closet accommodation of most factories in a frightful condition, but in nearly every case improvements had been made and more would follow at the close of winter. The inspectors said their greatest need in seeing the provisions of the act fully observed was the help of public-spirited citizens. Discussion of tenement houses was postponed until next meeting. Mr. Ruah Austin tells us in her recently published ""Memoirs"" that she was greatly exercised as to whether she was justified in retaining the word 'damn' in the recital of a story of Lord Jeffrey and Mr. Sydney Smith. Lord Lyttleton and others protested against it, and Lady Holland suggested the substitution of the word ""hang."" Now why? To ""damn"" is to condemn; to be ""damned"" is to be condemned, while to ""hang"" is to execute a condemnation, and to be ""hanged"" is to die in consequence of a condemnation. What then can be the difference? Whether Lord Jeffrey condemned the north pole, whether he expressed a wish that this meteorological point should be damned? It is held that to designate that the north pole or a chair or a home or a wife or anything or anyone else should be damned is to swear, whereas to express the desire that a thing or a person should be hanged is not. As a matter of fact, the use of neither of these expressions involves swearing. They are mere foolish terminologies by which the person using them wishes to convey the notion that he is displeased with the thing or the person against which either is leveled. ""Damn"" may be misused and vulgar, for verbal coarseness or vulgarity is effective throughout. I am not quite sure, however, that the expression of a wish that the north pole may be condemned is not a good deal more reasonable than that it should be hanged. Be this as it may, I entirely deny that damning is swearing. Truth. Cool. Jones (to Brown, who had just dropped in to borrow a fiver): ""Well, I'll do it this time, but I wonder you are not ashamed to be always in debt."" ""Look at me, I don't owe a penny."" Brown: ""Dare say not, old man. You haven't a borrowing face. Nobody would trust you."" It is stated that the result thus far of using dogs as messengers and sentinels of the German army has proved most successful. They have now been in training for a year. During the recent campaign, the dog management of one battalion is said to have been the most interesting of all. The kind found to be most suitable for this work are the shepherd's dogs. As an instance of what these dogs can do, on one occasion a soldier, in sending a dog from the sentinel, went off to reconnoitre. After making his observations, he wrote two reports, giving one to a Uhlan mounted on a fast horse, and placed the other in a casket tied to the dog's neck. The latter reached the sentinel first. When it is considered how much smaller an object a dog is than a soldier for an enemy's fire, and how it can run close to the ground, it is not unlikely that dogs may be important. 4TAJf KTEAHI4HIP HOIEHHITIL AnBivan February 1.

Belgrade, March 8. Milan's manifesto attributes the Servian successes to the virtues of the people. He takes upon himself the blame for the disasters and asks the forgiveness of those whom he has offended. He refers to his personal unhappiness and his broken health. In a letter to Count Zichy, Milan said hard work and illness had turned his hair gray and he had been unable to obtain more than three hours sleep nightly for weeks. He longed for freedom as a schoolboy longed for holidays. Alexander has sent a telegram to his mother announcing his accession, addressing her as Queen Natalie. He received a long reply.

Advices from Rome say the damage done by the recent snowstorm is enormous. Thousands of splendid firs were destroyed and several old dams and bridges ruined. A marked increase in hostility to foreigners is noticeable throughout China. The native soldiery at Choofoo are suspected of plotting to attack the foreign settlement. The Church of St. Charles, at Rome, is thronged with worshippers at every service. The Lenten sermons of the celebrated Father Agostinus are the sensation of the hour. In an interview at Vienna, M.

Neither can be reduced without three days' public notice, and the commission must also be notified of any contemplated changes. Individual and joint tariffs must be observed in their integrity and all interstate traffic is generally accepted under either an individual tariff or a joint tariff.

"18890311","H. Thompson of the University of the City of New York says, ""More adults are carried ill in this country by chronic kidney disease than by any other one malady except consumption."" The majority percent of all diseases are caused by unsuspected kidney poisoned blood. The late Dr. Dio Lewis, in speaking of Warner's Safe Cure, said over his signature, ""If I found myself the victim of a serious kidney trouble, I would use Warner's Safe Cure."" When Charles Dueller Warner was the editor of the Hartford (Conn.) Attic, back in the sixties, arousing the patriotism of the state with his vigorous appeals, one of the typesetters came in from the composing room, and, placing himself before the editor, said, ""Well, Mr. Warner, I've doubled to enlist in the army."" With mingled sensations of pride and responsibility, Mr. Warner replied encouragingly that he was glad to see the man felt the call of duty. ""Oh, it isn't that,"" said the truthful compositor, ""but I'd rather be shot than try to set any more of your blanked copy."" Hook Duitt, a Maine minister, recently said that he once upon a time received from an admiring female parishioner a present of a nicely made burial robe. The gift was made in evident good faith and innocence of any idea of impropriety that he received it with thanks and cheerfully laid it by against the need that must come. Lewiston Journal, OLIVER CROMWELL'S HOME, Fields Amid Which His Boyhood Was Passed, Hileam in the Brishborhoml Where Other Great Men Were Born The flor Oliver Naverd. Every man of Anglo-Saxon blood must necessarily feel some interest, whether friendly or hostile, in a place which was once, for many years together, the abode of Oliver Cromwell. As Lord line on would have phrased it, the methods employed in passing from Cambridge to St. Ives are three in number. The first and speediest (which is preferred by most visitors) is to take the Peterborough express train, which stops nowhere till it reaches St. Ives itself, thus saving the ""observant traveller"" the trouble of observing anything on the way. The second is to hire a chaise and drive out along the Huntingdon road, (the old ""Via Devana"" laid down by the Romans), which runs past the Ladies' college at Girton toward the town of Godmanchester, improved by local pronunciations into damstor. The third and best is to tramp out to St. Ives by the country road through Histon, Oakington, and Swavesey, a walk of about fifteen miles, which if not particularly picturesque in point of scenery, introduces you to several quaint little East Anglian villages and East Anglian churches that are very well worth seeing. The first of these is Histon (three miles from Cambridge), precious is the sight of all leave schoolboys as possessing a huge factory in which is made every possible kind of jelly and jam. But, even apart from this great benefit to mankind, the little hamlet has more than one claim to attention. A painter would love to copy it as a perfect type of the old-fashioned English village of last century, complete in all its details. The queer little red-tiled inn, with its deep, tunnel-like porch, furnished with side benches for the convenience of those rustic who prefer to take their beer sitting rather than standing; the tiny cottages, fronted with black and white cross-beams, and roofed with an overlapping thatch that comes so low down over the narrow lozenge-paned windows as to give them the look of a man peering through a hole in the brim of his hat; the quiet old church tower of dark-gray stone, watching over the moss-grown, weather-stained tombs below; the village green, overshadowed by its giant elms, and in its center the usual muddy pond, swarming with fat geese, which might well pass for the transmigrated spirits of the ""fine old English farmers"" of past generations. There were formerly two parishes of Histon, the boundaries of which met at the spot where the present village stands, and the two rival parish churches actually stood facing each other in the same churchyard, a circumstance which may, perhaps, have given rise to the famous story of the countryman who excused himself for not being touched by an affecting sermon on the ground that he belonged to another parish. This curious arrangement remained in force till the year 1830, when a certain sacrilegious gentleman of the neighborhood named Sir Francis Hire set the first example of ""church disestablishment"" by pulling down the opposition place of worship and carting away its materials to build a house for himself near the village of Madingley, a few miles away to the southwest. About a mile from Histon lies Impington, formerly the seat of a branch of the Pepys family, from which sprang that brisk and chatty little admiralty clerk whom all the world now knows as the author of ""Pepys' Diary."" In the chancel of the tiny church, fastened by chains to one of the stalls to preserve any enthusiastic collector from a breach of the Eighth Commandment, are three very rare blackletter copies of Fox's famous ""Book of Martyrs."" Close to this church occurred almost within the memory of living men an adventure which might cast into the shade many a sensation novel. On a bleak Tuesday morning in February, 1705, two sturdy farm laborers, while plowing their way through the drifts heaped up by a snowstorm such as the oldest inhabitant could not remember, suddenly espied the corner of a red shawl protruding from the side of a vast mound of snow. Hastily scraping away the drift, they found underneath the seemingly lifeless form of a market woman from one of the outlying villages, Elizabeth Woodcock by name, with a basket of eggs and vegetables by her side. Some faint signs of life having been detected in the motionless figure, her rescuers carried her into the nearest cottage where, under the application of various restoratives, she began slowly to revive. Her first question on regaining consciousness was whether she was still in time for the market, at which her deliverers stared in bewilderment, as well they might, the weekly market at Cambridge having taken place three days before. Little by little it came out that the storm had overtaken her on her way to the town on Saturday morning, and that she must have been lying insensible beneath the snowdrift for three days and three nights! To the amazement of all who had witnessed this strange adventure she completely recovered from its effects and lived to tell it to her grandchildren more than a quarter of a century later. Cakingston, the next village, does not appear to be celebrated for anything except the longevity of its inhabitants. ""In the year 1316,"" says an old chronicler, ""there were in this place divers persons of exceeding great age, to wit, one of 120 years, two that had overpassed 100, and other two that were something beyond 80."" This would have been just the place for the old English story of the white-bearded patriarch of old who was found by a passing traveller weeping bitterly by the roadside, having just been flogged by his father for disturbing his grandfather's field labor by throwing stones at him. The only remarkable feature of the hamlets of Swavesey and Over is the antique architecture of their churches, which would have delighted that would-be connoisseur who spoke of Cleopatra as having been ""stung to death by an asp"" instead of an osp. A little beyond Over you cross the ""crawling Ouse"" (which at this point forms the boundary line between Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire), and another half mile or so brings you to the town of St. Ives himself. So utterly does the outward aspect of this spot contradict the sole historical association which it possesses that almost every visitor feels an involuntary thrill of surprise and disappointment at the first sight of it. It certainly would be difficult to imagine a more inappropriate place of abode for the terrible man whose stormy genius shook the very core of England from its foundations than this sleepy little provincial town with its old-fashioned houses, surrounded on every side by green swampy meadows, so utterly flat that the tapering spire of the town church can be seen several miles away. On market days a brief spasm of bustle galvanizes this dead-alive place into something like life; but at other times the current of its existence is as sluggish as that of the river that creeps through it, which requires considerable study before you can discover which way it is flowing. Little, indeed, could anyone expect to find great soldier and statesman among these beef-fed farmers in muddy top-boots, and these shock-headed louts in greasy fustian, whose thoughts (so far as they can be said to have any) are occupied solely with a possible change in the rate of wages or a threatened alteration in the price of wheat and turnips. Of progress or improvement they have as much idea as the cattle that graze around them, and certainly Canon Haysley could have found no better illustration in his eloquent description of the East Anglian lowlands, where he speaks of the English lowlander as having his soul gradually dulled and deadened by his unpoetical surroundings and monotonous life. He has little or nothing around him to refine or lift up his soul, and unless he should meet with a religion and with a civilization which can deliver him he may sink into the dull brutality which is only too common among the lowest class of those who inhabit the lowlands of England. He may remain for many generations a creature gifted with the strength and industry of the ox and with the courage of the lion, but possessing, alas! the intellect of the former and the self-restraint of the latter. But terribly true though all this is, there is something to be said for these despised lowlands, after all. Flat and tame though they are, they gave birth to the two most fiery and energetic souls in all Britain, and by far the greatest men whom the ordinary popular form of English Puritanism (for Milton was a Puritan of an exceptional type) has ever produced. Such, beyond all question, were Oliver Cromwell and John Bunyan; and both were born in this very district, the one 10 miles to the west, near Huntingdon, and the other 20 miles to the southwest, near Bedford. Nor are they by any means solitary examples. In fact, it is rather curious to note how many of England's greatest worthies have sprung from the low, unpicturesque, monotonous flats of the eastern counties. Nelson himself was born and bred at Burnham Thorpe, on those flat dreary, interminable sands which separate the Norfolk lowland from the sullen waters of the German ocean. The neighboring village of Cockthorpe gave birth to Admiral Sir Clowdesley Shovell, the greatest English sailor of the reign of Queen Anne, while Docking sent forth Admiral Hawke, the fiery leader who forced his way through storm and darkness into the most perilous roadstead of the Bay of Biscay to attack a French fleet stronger than his own. The low grazing lands of Ipswich were the birthplace of Cardinal Wolsey. Level Northamptonshire produced John Dryden. The green meadows of East Anglia were the source of William Cowper's life as well as of his poetry. Norwich places at the head of a lengthy list of names renowned in art and literature those of Jane Austen and Harriet Martineau. Flat, unromantic, Lowestoft has given to the British navy a line of valiant captains too numerous to name. Miss Burney, one of the greatest of English lady novelists, was born on the marshy soil of Suffolk. The dreary fens of East Lincolnshire added to this grand historical muster Elizabeth's famous prime minister, Lord Burghley, as well as Hereward the Saxon, who held out so long and so manfully against the overwhelming power of William the Conqueror. From the adjacent village of Boston went forth that little band of heroic-lated exiles, who, although obscure and nameless while on earth, now live forever in history as ""The Pilgrim Fathers."" As regards the historical memories of St. Ives, Cromwell's worshippers (unless gifted with a very powerful imagination) will find little more to gratify them than Wolsey's remains found at Ipswich. At the latter place there is nothing to see except Wolsey's house. At St. Ives there is nothing to see except Cromwell's house, and many authorities are greatly in doubt whether it was ever really Cromwell's or not. An antique edifice of dark red brickwork, wreathed with ivy, standing at the southern end of the town, with a big old-fashioned barn by its side, is certainly pointed out as the great leader's abode during the last peaceful years that he was ever to know upon earth. There can be little question that the good people who point them out would exhibit with equal readiness, on receipt of an extra shilling or two, his sword, his autograph, the pen with which he signed Charles I's death warrant, and anything else that might be called for. But the evidence in this case is on a par with that to launch Shakespeare's ""Jack Cade"" appealed so confidently: ""He made a chimney in my father's house, and the bricks are alive at this day to testify to it."" The fields which Cromwell tilled here are here still, and that is all. But, nevertheless, this little sanctuary of the practical and the unromantic is not to be despised by any student of history. There is a certain gloomy picturesqueness in the mere contrast between the commonplace surroundings of the greatest Englishman of his time and the tremendous events through which his checkered life was destined to pass before its stormy close. Tumult and civil war, the death of a king and the birth of an era, the bloody fields of Dunbar and Worcester, the massacre of Drogheda and the storming of Wexford, still lie hid in the unknown future, and Oliver rides to and fro around his quiet farmlands, doing with all his might that which his hand findeth to do and leaving the rest to God. Even then, although the keenest intellect could not have divined that this clownish, coarse-featured, silent man would one day be the lord of all Britain, his sturdy common sense and stout English hatred of oppression in any form had endeared him to the simple country folks around him who felt instinctively that there was a man upon whom they could rely, and who would neither be cowed by threats nor cajoled by flattery. His vigorous efforts to improve the town lands and the system of farming employed upon them were greatly remembered long after he had exchanged the plough for the sword; and when more than two generations had elapsed since his death, the honest Huntingdon farmers were still wont to couple his name with two strangely different exploits: ""Noll Cromwell, ye know, him that dug Metboll Dike, and cut King Charles's head off."" Westward along the valley of the Ouse, between St. Ives and Huntingdon, stretches a broad belt of low rich land which was once an undrained swamp full of perilous bogs. Here it was that there befell, early in the seventeenth century, an accident which came within a hair's breadth of changing the entire history of Britain. Toward evening on a fine summer day in 1645 an active young parish clergyman of this district was returning from a long country walk, and, finding himself rather later than he expected, attempted to take a short cut home by a path which led through the swamp, little dreaming that from that apparently trivial act were to result consequences of incalculable importance to the future of the whole English people. As he forced his way through the interlacing boughs that barred his advance he was suddenly arrested by the sound of a voice crying for help in the shrill, strained tones of one in mortal peril. Dashing recklessly through mud and briars in the direction of the sound, he came at length to the brink of a fathomless bog, from the foul blue ooze of which there looked up at him a lugubrious face, which he recognized to his no small amazement as that of young Master Oliver, the nine-year-old son of his friend and neighbor, Robert Cromwell, of Huntingdon. A few moments more and the sinking boy would have disappeared forever and he was already so deeply imbedded that even when the clergyman, at his own imminent risk, had ventured along the half-sunk stem of a fallen tree and grasped the perishing child by the hand, it seemed more than doubtful whether the man would drag the boy out or the boy cling to the man. But after a moment of awful uncertainty the rescuer's strength began slowly to prevail, and the future master of England, gasping, worn out, and covered with mud from head to foot, was brought safely on to firm land. The good parson doubtless congratulated himself not a little upon the success of his hazardous exploit, and probably thanked Heaven devoutly that night for having made his ""fleshly arm"" the instrument of saving a human life. But he viewed the transaction in a very different light forty years later when he had lived to see that tender boy head a rebellion against ""the powers that be ordained of God,"" trampled in the dust the loyalists of England on many a hard-fought battlefield, and cut off the sacred head of the Lord's anointed, thereby decapitating the church as well as the King. In 1649, just after Charles I's execution, the worthy clergyman was in London on business, when a shout of ""Make way for his Excellency, Gen. Cromwell,"" made him turn round to find himself face to face with the man whom he most abhorred upon earth. The look of half-amused recognition in the regicide's stern eyes as their glances met was the last straw that broke the clerical's back. All the consequences of what he had done rushed upon his mind at once, and in the bitterness of his heart he exclaimed, reckless of his own safety: ""Had I known what manner of man thou wert to be I would never have stretched out a finger to save thee from yonder bog."" A grim smile flickered for one moment over the great Captain's iron features as he heard the reproach, and, looking fixedly at his accuser, answered composedly: ""Verily, friend, I doubt it not; but the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.""

Captain Miller said twelve of Legitime's soldiers taken prisoners some months ago by Hyppolite were shot in the public square at Cape Haytien the day before the steamer left. Sympathizers with Legitime had endeavored to get the men released and Hyppolite had become distrustful of many of his officers. He therefore had them put to death.

Seven times she has vowed to love, honor and obey; and, one by one, six have been taken from her, and she is trying to console herself with Mr. Rawlins, a young fellow of 28, whom she raised herself and who in gratitude calls her ""Mamma."" Mrs. Rawlins is described as a somewhat masculine woman, a quality which she has perhaps caught from much association with members of the opposite sex; and her lot has been cast among the border lands of Montana and Oregon, where she has grown mild in cattle and timber and deceased husbands. We are glad to record that she lost her husbands legitimately; snowstorms, in junes and bucking horses mostly brought about the funerals. There were no divorces; there were no parallel passages in the lines of her married life. She has simply been six times widowed and is still not out. Such a domestic phenomenon quite puts in the shade the engaging widow in ""Dorothy,"" who confessed, if we remember rightly, to being ""four widows,"" and yet was not unfavorably inclined to the suit of the fine hunting Lurcher.

He keeps the Admiralty busily engaged in supplying him with reports, minutely detailing the construction and condition of every warship. Since the English Parliament voted the addition of 70 ships to the navy, His Majesty's attention centers exclusively upon Admiralty affairs.

"18890619","KL'NDAV RAILWAY LAUNCHED The General Manager of the Grand Trunk on the policy of his company The last issue of the Chicago Bulletin contains the following interesting letter from Mr. Jackson on the subject of Sunday railway labor: MONTREAL, JUNE 1, 1890, To the Editor of the Railway Ann in reference to your letter of 17th ultimo respecting Holiday train service I am a very firm believer in the advantage of a strict observance of the Lord's day, and I have done what I could to resist the continual demands made for increased service upon the Grand Trunk railway on that day, and personally would be happy if such service could be discontinued entirely. I cannot refrain from saying, however, that public sentiment, to which I am able to judge, grows toward a desire for a longer service on Sundays: and on sections of the railway this company has not altogether escaped censure for refusing to run trains which have been suggested. There are certain classes of traffic such as live stock and perishable articles, which, if it is not absolutely unavoidable to move on Sundays, it seems to me a refusal to do so would result in serious inconvenience, and the transfer thereof altogether from the Canadian railways in many instances. Railway companies are in a sense public servants, and it is not practicable for them to take the initiative in stopping the running of all trains on the Lord's day. If such a result is to be accomplished it must be brought about by a change in public sentiment, as far as this continent is concerned, over a very large area, if not over all the United States and Canada. The Canadian railway companies would undoubtedly, in a monetary sense, suffer very seriously if they were to decline to run any trains on Sunday whilst their competitors in the United States continued to do so. Sunday labor on the Grand Trunk is not carried on to such an extent as to cause general, moral or physical deterioration of the employees, and I think I am correct in saying that over two thousand one hundred miles of the whole system in Canada there is no Holiday labor at all, and that over four hundred and thirty miles there is nothing more, as a rule, than the passage of a train in the early morning, proceeding to the termination of its journey begun on the preceding day. The total mileage of the railway in Canada is 21,750 miles. Our rule as to merchandise is that certain descriptions of perishable articles and live stock which are in transit have to be moved, and it occasionally occurs, where traffic has been delayed by snowstorms, that to prevent serious loss and inconvenience to the public, it has to be carried forward."
"18890801","PREPARING FOR A RETREAT, Ulnine Shirks Responsibility for the Retiring Sea Seizure, THE ELIXIR OF LIFE FOUND, Controversy between the Warring Pacific Railroads and the Knights A Murderer's Awful Death, Damior, Me, July 31, Secretary Blaine here this evening denied the statement of a paper that he had declared that Bering Sea is distinctly American water, Mr. Blaine further stated that everything done on the fur seal question since the 4th of last March was in literal compliance with the directions contained in the act of Congress approved by President Cleveland on the last day of his term, What is Thought in Washington, Washington, July 31, The State department has no official advices respecting the seizures of the schooners Triumph and Black Diamond by the cutter Rush for sealing in Bering Sea, A prominent official said today that whatever might have been the policy and feeling of the last administration, it was evident the present administration did not look with disfavor upon the seizure of British or other vessels suspected of poaching upon the United States seal fishing grounds, As to the report that an understanding existed by which the British Government was not to take notice of such seizures, he knew nothing, If such understanding existed he was not aware of it, May Be a Very Serious Matter, The case of the seizure and search of the Triumph, which was afterwards released because no sealskins were found on board, this official intimated, might be a more serious matter than the seizure and detention of the Black Diamond, for it involved the right of the United States to seize and search suspected vessels outside of what is conceded to be the limits of the jurisdiction of the United States, This government, he said, claims that right within a limit not yet acknowledged by England, and the settlement of this question, after all, is to be one of jurisdiction, The Flour Production, Minneapolis, July 31, The Northwestern Miller states: The total production of flour last week was 124,000 barrels, against 110,270 the preceding week and 160,000 barrels for the corresponding time in 1888, There were sixteen mills running today, getting out at the rate of 10,500 barrels or over, The flour market is pretty quiet at present, There is quite a difference in quotations made by the various firms, and they average about 10 cents cheaper than a week ago, The best demand is for bakers' flour from abroad, the current make being easily disposed of at moderate prices, There is some inquiry for future delivery, Freight rates are to be advanced tomorrow by most of the lines ten cents per barrel, and ocean rates are also much higher, The direct exports for the week were 34,000 barrels, against 32,000 the preceding week, The new crop is of the finest quality, It is not unlikely that of winter and spring there are 600,000,000 bushels of excellent wheat, The wheat in the country elevators, as well as that in farmers' hands, is well cleaned up, A Whaling Crew's Fate in the Arctic, San Francisco, July 31, Survivors of the wrecked whaling barque Little Ohio state that the vessel sank near Point Hope during a severe snowstorm, Capt. Allen ordered the masts cut away, and was immediately carried overboard and lost, The Ohio broke up rapidly, The men, who were nearly frozen to death, could not keep their hold on the masts and the rigging and were swept away by the waves, Most of them were unable to keep themselves afloat in the raging waters, Alexander Omey gave up hope while on the vessel and killed himself with his pistol, The first mate, Thomas F. Prase, and second mate, Thomas H. Miles, were so badly frozen that they died on the beach, Several men were killed by the debris of the wreck while attempting to crawl upon the beach, On October 10th the first mate, Manuel Lopez, and fourth mate, Joseph J. Enos, with their sailors, put off to intercept a passing whaling barque, and the natives say they saw the boat capsize and all were drowned, A Murderer's Awful Death, Louisville, July 31, Charles Dilger, murderer of two policemen last August, and Harry Smart, murderer of Meisner Green and wife, were hanged at 6:05 o'clock this morning, Smart probably died instantly, but Dilger slipped through the noose, the rope catching him over the chin at the lower teeth, He was seemingly unhurt and was drawn up by the rope until his shoulders came through the trap, when the deputies took him by the arms and pulled him upon the scaffold, A new rope was brought into service and when the noose was adjusted Dilger asked what's the matter? On being told the rope had slipped its knot, he said, this shows I should not die, He placed himself upon the trap the second time by making two hops, The trap was again sprung and he was strangled to death, Killing a Lawless Fiend, New Orleans, La, July 31, The first severe blow at the suppression of the lawless regulators has been struck at Lafayette, Following the regulator outrages early in June by the Lafayette outlaws, came the lynching of the negro Felix Key, Key had brained his wife with an axe and had been jailed, The outlaws broke into the jail, took Key out and hanged him, The sheriff then set about capturing the parties, most of whom were known and included Ernest Beitard, planter and merchant, O."

The provisional directors are: Hon. Henry Avlmer, advocate, Richmond; James Muir, farmer, Melbourne; Clarence Chester, Cleveland, manufacturer and farmer, Louisville; John Wadleigh, farmer, Tiverton; Richard Hurst, farmer, Cleveland; Joseph Beelard, merchant, Richmond; James Miller, Leverton, and John Ewing, Jr., agent, Richmond. They express confidence in the security and in the stability of a 6 percent dividend on the stock, of which 1 percent will be paid from the grant of the Council of Agriculture, and 2 percent from the revenue of the farm. The whole of the stock is expected to be taken up before December 2nd, at which date the subscribers will meet in the union for the purpose of organizing. The price to be paid for the property is £60, the Government giving free of cost the barns and creamery now owned by the province, and valued at $2,500. The Council of Agriculture also promises a subscription of $2,400, the dividends on which are to be applied to furthering the objects of the college. There is also a Council of Agriculture grant of $2,000 as provided by statute. The cost to the students for board, etc., and tuition, is put at $120 for the two months' term. Besides giving instruction on the farm, it is the intention of the college to provide facilities for farmers during the winter months, to meet the professors and students for the discussion and investigation of practical subjects especially pertaining to the feeding and care of the different breeds of cattle, horses, etc., and testing results, with a view to breeding from the most profitable strains for sale and distribution in the province. NORTHWEST RANCHING An Illustration of the Profit of Beef Raising in Canada. Mr. John White, ex-M.P., gave the Empire a piece of information testifying to the immense possibilities of our Northwest country, which, if the reliability of the source from which it springs were not well known, might easily be questioned. Mr. White was travelling through the Northwest a few days ago, and on the cars he happened to meet Senator Cochrane, head of the well-known Cochrane Ranching Company. The two gentlemen naturally discussed, among other things, Northwest prospects, when Mr. Cochrane made the following remarkable statement: Six years ago the Cochrane Company drove into Alberta 6,000 head of cattle, locating them on what is now the town site of Calgary. Many of the animals were footsore from constant travelling, and before they could be safely housed for the winter a tremendous snowstorm came and 1,500 head died, representing a loss to the company of $100,000. The ranch was restocked and by mismanagement during the following year a further loss of $150,000 was sustained. Since then prosperity has been with the company. During the last three years their previous losses have been entirely made up, and in addition the company has paid 10 percent on its investment, and put $100,000 to rest. Kess's Cocoa, a great staple and consumable. By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr."
"18891109","THIS TOWNSHIP'S CAPITAL A wire for the Canadian Pacific Railway's Toronto correspondent Siikrihbook, P.Q., November 8 Some local contractors are sending in to the Canadian Pacific offices in Montreal, tenders for the construction of the new railway station which that company has recently announced their intention of erecting here. It is to be a handsome building of brick, some 100 feet long by 40 wide, is to be fitted with all modern improvements and to cost in the neighborhood of $10,000. Not long ago the Grand Trunk management announced the immediate construction of a handsome station upon the site of the present one, to cost something well up in the thousands. The Canadian Pacific, of course, are bound to see there, at least as far as announcements go, and the question as to whether both projects will not end in smoke is just now agitating the public mind. Lieutenant-Colonel Mattice, brigade major of this military district, visited the Bishop's College school yesterday for the purpose of inspecting the arms and accoutrements at present on hand, and also with a view of fixing what steps could be taken towards a reorganization of the cadet corps which formerly flourished in the school. Death in this blizzard in oily Herds and Cattle in New Mexico Nnosileirm, Dayton, New Mexico, November 8 Unless the snowstorm which has been raging for eight days comes to an end soon, next summer will show a country covered with the dead bodies of animals. The depth of snow is now not less than 26 inches on a level and in many places it has drifted seven feet high. When the storm struck this section seven large herds of cattle, numbering from 500 to 2,000 each, were being held near this place awaiting shipment to eastern markets. The rain of a week ago was followed Thursday morning by blizzards of snow and sleet which sent the herds in a southerly direction. In vain did the half-frozen cowboys try to check the march of the cattle, but on they went through the merciless storm until, finding it utterly impossible to hold the cattle, the cowboys rode aside and allowed them to pass, and when nearly dead rode their exhausted horses into canyons or partially sheltered places, where they passed many hours without food or fire. Five cowboys and two Mexican sheep herders are known to have been frozen to death. It is estimated that 20,000 sheep have perished in this part of the territory. The hay supply is nearly exhausted and $100 per ton is offered by stockmen. At Texline, nine miles below Clayton, two passenger trains have been snowbound for a week. Provisions are running out and the passengers are compelled to venture into the storm and kill cattle, the quarters of which are taken into the cars and roasted for food. It is thought the snowplow will reach the stranded trains today and release them. P.C., November 8 Railroad men report more trouble on the Divide today. The wind is blowing a perfect hurricane and cuts are filled with snow. All trains are blocked again, and the Fort Worth travel has stopped altogether. The situation there is much worse, as another great snowstorm is raging evidently in the Ballon Mountains.

The Merry Kief Kb Bell has come to hint a heavy snowfall. Montreal has put on her winter clothing, and from now until the springtime any defects or eyesores will be hidden from sight, and our citizens can boast that we have a clean city. The operation was performed last night, and it didn't take long, not nearly as long as it does for the city to don her summer attire. The snowstorm, which began early in the afternoon, continued all the evening and at the time of writing shows no sign of cessation. Early in the evening the streetcars found much difficulty in making their way, and double teams had to be employed. It did not take long for the sleighs to come out and by 8 o'clock the streets resounded with the merry sound of the sleigh bells. The advent of sleighing is nearly two months later than last year, when it came on October 6, but now it has come, it looks as if it had come to stay. The snowfall up to 11 p.m., as recorded at McGill University, was 7.0 inches, and in this connection the following table showing the first snowfall for the past fifty years may be interesting: Amount recorded in inches."
"18891129","THE STORM ON THE LAKES, November 1, The Intya Will be Remembered, Lend by Our Inland Mariner, Owin Sorsp, Ont, November 28, Last night, while the steamer Alberta was leaving the harbor on her last trip to Port Arthur, she struck on a sandbar opposite the Dummy light, she is still on. A heavy northwest gale is blowing, and a blinding snowstorm. In all probability she will be off by daylight. The water in the harbor fell two feet yesterday, but is rising again this afternoon. Wilkson, Ont, November 28, A wind and snowstorm passed here Tuesday night doing damage to telegraph poles and wires in this vicinity.

The Tempest at Quebec, Quebec, November 28, The city is passing through its first snowstorm of the season. It struck here shortly after 10 o'clock last night, increasing in violence until it is now in full blast. The wind is blowing from the east with almost hurricane force, accompanied by fine penetrating snow. A few unswept chimneys keep up some excitement by taking fire and the usual number of loose signs, chimney tops and window shutters are falling victims to the fury of the gale. In the Princess Louise basin several batteaux got loose and created havoc among the craft wintering there. No considerable damage has resulted. The ferry boats between this city and Levis could not make their regular trips owing to the blinding snow and fury of the wind. Home talk was indulged in as to the safety of the steamship Electrique, the last outward vessel of the season, which left port last night; but she is supposed to be weathering the storm at anchor not far from port. COAL MINES ON FIRE, Thousands of Tons Burning; General News from the North, Winnipeg, November 28, A telegram from Elmoro, Assiniboia, to the Sun says: Intelligence has been received here that the coal fields are on fire. There was a big loss in the coal fields this summer, in one mine flumes burst through into the pit and burned fifty thousand tons of coal, which was mined. It is estimated that the fire is 200 feet deep. It is supposed that it originated from prairie fires. The mines have been on fire five years and winter has no effect on the flames. Tons of thousands of tons are burned monthly. At a meeting of the board of works today it was decided to advertise for tenders for the construction of the Assiniboine water power works on the plans adopted by the Dominion Government. Tenderers are required to put up a cheque for $20,000.

The last act in the Harvey tragedy was enacted this morning at 8 o'clock. During the night, Archdeacon Dixon passed a few hours giving the doomed man consolation, and this morning he again assisted him and bid him goodbye. Harvey bid the jail officials goodbye and spent his few remaining hours in spiritual conversation. Harvey slept and ate a hearty breakfast. About 7:55 the hangman entered his cell and pinioned his arms, and the procession, headed by Archdeacon Dixon, followed by the prisoner, sheriff, and hangman, marched to the place of execution. Harvey looked dejected and only looked up once as he neared the gallows. The prayers for the dead of the English Church were offered by the archdeacon, during the performance of which the black cap was fastened over Harvey's head, and the rope was cut. It was one of the worst pieces of bungling that has ever been witnessed at an execution. The weight which lifted the body was not heavy enough to give sufficient rebound to break the neck and the contortions of the unhappy man were frightful as he slowly strangled to death. Those present could not but express themselves as to the bungling way the executioner did his part of the sad act. The knot had slipped and caught in front of the ear and the gurgling sounds of the suffocating man could be heard outside the jail wall, and many of those who witnessed the execution left the place as soon as they possibly could. At 10:30 a.m., Coroner Keating held an inquest over the remains of Harvey. Dr. Herod in his evidence severely commented on the bungling manner in which the execution was done. He felt Harvey's pulse after he had been hanging seven minutes and found it at 60. Harvey was conscious at the time, he thought, from the pulse, from the grasp of the hand, and from the movements of the body. He made a special examination of the corpse and found that the neck was not dislocated. The jury found that Harvey had died according to law, and recommended that the Government be asked to consider the advisability of employing an official expert executioner. The remains were handed over to Dr. Lett and Archdeacon Dixon and the funeral took place from the jail to the English Church cemetery, where the body was interred beside that of Mrs. Harvey and those of Lily and Geraldine Harvey. The funeral was strictly private. The paper in Harvey's hand at the time he was hanged was a letter from Geraldine in reference to a coming anniversary and a portion of a letter from his son. ""MARTIN'S UTOPIA."" A Would-Be Murderess Acquitted. General Northwest News. Winnipeg, November 29. The Free Press dismisses Attorney-General Martin's great scheme of uniting the whole west in one province by saying that he has decided to call it Portage la Prairie. The Sun, in discussing Martin's proposition, brings up an argument for the abolition of the tariff, and holds that a union of the people from the Lake of the Woods to the Rockies would enable them to persistently agitate until the tariff was abolished. It recommends that all other considerations be dropped, as they sink into oblivion compared with the evil wrought on this country through the operation of the tariff. Mr. Lough, of Calgary, who was charged with attempting to murder Scott, whom she claimed as her husband, has been found not guilty, and in a suit brought by her against his estate for maintenance, the jury disagreed. The date for the Kildonan election has not yet been decided on, although the candidates are canvassing vigorously. Frank Craihlock, of Portage, died suddenly yesterday.

The heavy snowstorm of yesterday blocked the roads in the country, and therefore a good many farmers were unable to come into town this morning, and in consequence, the attendance at Consocours market this morning was small. The demand, however, was generally fair; in some lines very good, and a fair amount of business was transacted. There was hardly any grain in the market, and the quotations are therefore nominal at unchanged prices. We quote oats at 70c & 85c per bag, peas at 70c & 80c per bushel, corn at 58c & 65c, and beans at $1.75 & $2. The demand for vegetables was active but was met with very light supplies owing to the late storm. Prices remained unchanged and a weak business was done at quotations. Cabbages sold at 30c to 40c per dozen, potatoes at 75c to $1 per bag, carrots and turnips at 60c per bushel, onions at 75c per bushel, and spinach at 60c. In fruits, the demand was fair for all sorts, but, as was the case with vegetables, the supplies were light. Notwithstanding this, trade was good, and a considerable quantity of fruit was disposed of at steady and unchanged prices. Apples sold at $3 to $3.50 per barrel for ordinary sorts, while some of the finest went as high as $5. Oranges, both Jamaica and Florida, sold at 40c per dozen, cranberries at 40c to 50c per gallon, pears at $1 to $1.60 per basket, bananas at 40c to 50c per dozen, and pineapples at 40c to 50c each. The market for dairy produce has been rather better lately, with an improved demand and fair supplies. Today, however, there was very little offered on the market, which sold fairly at steady and unchanged prices. We quote choice print butter and creamery at 25c to 30c per pound, good dairy at 20c to 25c, cheese at 12c to 14c, new laid eggs at 30c per dozen, limed at 20c, and maple sugar at 80c to 90c per tin. Owing to the severe weather experienced, there was a sudden falling off in the receipts of dressed poultry, which, with an active demand, put prices up 5c on fowls and chickens. The other sorts sold well and a good deal of business was transacted. Fowls sold at 65c to 80c per pair, chickens at 65c to 70c, ducks at 75c to $1, turkeys at 70c to $2.23 each, and geese at 75c to $1 each. The demand for game was active, and a good trade was the rule in all sorts. The receipts were very light, and a scarcity in partridges, which were in demand, was the result. In consequence, prices went up 10c for these birds but remained unchanged for all others. We quote partridges at 60c to 75c per pair, woodcock at $1.25, black duck at $1 to $1.10, wood duck at 45c to 50c, blue bill ducks at 50c to 60c, and broiler chickens at $1.50. Meats were in fair demand with supplies sufficient to meet the requirements, prices were steady and unchanged. Choice beef sold at 12c to 15c, and common at 8c to 10c per lb. Mutton was at 12c, lamb at 12c to 15c, and pork at 12c to 14c. Dressed hogs sold at $7 to $7.60 per 100 lbs. The fish market was dull this morning with light supplies and a poor demand, and not much business was done. We quote lobsters at 10c, cod at 6c, fresh salmon at 26c, and sole at 12c per lb. Montreal, November 29. In consequence of the severe storm of yesterday, which blocked the roads, very little hay was in the hay market today, there not being more than thirty loads in all. This met with a quiet demand as prices were high, $9 to $10 being asked per hundred bundles. There was only one load of straw on the market, and our quotations are therefore nominal at $8 to $9 per hundred bundles as to quality. The demand for pressed hay and straw continues very quiet, and only a few small local orders have been placed during the week. We quote No. 1 at $10, No. 2 at $8 to $8.60, No. 3 at $7 to $7.50 per ton. Straw is at $5 to $6 per ton. There has been good demand for feed during the week, and the market has remained steady at the advance. Bran and shorts are both scarce, while the demand for them is active. We quote $10 per ton for oats, $14 for bran, and $22 for meal. THE WEATHER. A Fairly Active Movement Noted. New York, November 29. Special telegrams to Bradstreet's indicate the continuance of a fairly active movement of general merchandise, although the intervention of a holiday and unfavorable weather tended to restrict the volume of trade. Hogs are lower on heavy receipts at the west, but pork and lard, under a fair demand, have been firm at moderate advances. Eastern Texas mills are shipping lumber to Central and South America, stock speculation is disturbed and prices depressed by the prominence of financial and currency questions among the probabilities of the coming Congress. A judicial decision against the validity of the Chicago Gas trust causes depression in the trusts and weakens the general market. Money at New York is firm and inactive at 6 to 7 percent on call. Foreign exchange is quiet; demand sterling $1.85."

Having been up the night previous, the crew, including the captain, had something to eat and then lay down. The cook was sitting beside the captain when he noticed smoke, and on making an investigation he found the cabin ablaze. All hands were roused, but the fire spread rapidly and they were unable to reach the yawl boat. The flames soon broke out at the forward hatch, and the men were driven out on the boom, from which place they watched the masts go overboard. Fortunately the schooner was only forty or fifty feet from the shore. Had she been out any distance the whole crew would have been drowned. A boat put out from the island and into it the crew dropped from the boom and were taken ashore. The cook had his hair singed. He opened the door of the cabin when the flames shot out and licked his hair off. The names of the crew are: Capt.

No official notifications had yet been made. The new Government was probably awaiting the assembling of the chamber before officially notifying the foreign powers of the establishment of the Republic. Balfour and the Irish College. Glasgow, December 2. Mr. Balfour, the chief secretary for Ireland, in his speech here today, set forth the ideas of the Government on the subject of a proposed Irish college. He proposes that Government aid shall be given to a Catholic college in which the regular curriculum shall be given, including the classics and mathematics, but that the Government shall not endow any institution for teaching theology in Ireland. Mr. Balfour declared, however, that he would never advise his colleagues in the ministry to embark upon this arduous enterprise unless the following absolutely necessary conditions were fulfilled: First, that the boon should be cordially accepted by the intended recipients, the Irish people; second, that the offer shall not be used as a political weapon by one party in Parliament against its opponents; third, that Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen shall all concur in offering this boon. He confessed he saw no likelihood that it would be accepted with these conditions. It was never any part of his intention that the government should endow a Catholic theological chair. His only purpose had been to equip the necessary chair for the study of literature, science, medicine, and law. He believed that founding a complete university would be fatal to higher education in Ireland because it would remove the competition between Catholics and Protestants. DowTlssa Was to Have Been Dynamited. NNA, December 2. Important discoveries have been made by the police of the details of the attempt to assassinate the Hungarian Prime Minister Tiz. Four persons were designated by the conspirators to place dynamite beneath the pavement with such connections that it could be exploded under the feet of the minister as he passed in or out. The minister's life was saved by the fact that a member of the opposition was let into the secret by the conspirators and persuaded them to abandon their plan. Prussia Wouldn't Refund. Munich, December 2. A rumor has been current that negotiations between Prussia and the Vatican had come to a standstill owing to the refusal of the former to refund $3,500,000 sequestrated from the Catholic church during the Kulturkampf. On the authority of Vatican officials, the report is declared to be unfounded. A Fire Spr. Munich, December 2.

"18891206","(HI, ""Journal Pioneer Press"") Ninety-five leading citizens of Montreal, including the Mayor and aldermen and representatives of the press of that city, arrived in St. Paul yesterday morning. They came as guests of the Canadian Pacific, which was desirous of showing the civic officials and important business men of Montreal the great country which forms the American Northwest and the wonderful cities which have grown up here within a very few years. It has been the desire of the Canadian Pacific to obtain a share of the immense trade of this section of the country, and this it is now securing through close connections with the Soo road to St. Paul and Minneapolis, and the Duluth, South Shore & Atlantic to Duluth. Great difficulty has been experienced, however, in handling this traffic in the harbor of Montreal, and it has been evident that the facilities there must be greatly increased. It was with this object in view that the Canadian Pacific Railway invited the Mayor, aldermen, and Harbor commissioners to visit St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Duluth in order that they might gain a true idea of the immense trade which, the Canadian Pacific officials say, is bound to go through Montreal. President Van Horne and General Manager Mclaughnessy intended to accompany the party to St. Paul, but at the last moment were prevented from doing so by urgent business calling them in other directions, and they sent Mr. George J. Rury, private secretary to the president, in their stead. The party left Montreal on Friday morning in the middle of a blinding snowstorm and the mercury in the thermometer almost out of sight, and after a pleasant run over the Canadian Pacific to Baie St. Paul, and thence over the Soo road, arrived here at dawn yesterday to find the weather as warm as on a day in June. They had a delightful trip and everyone was singing the praises of Mr. Rury, who left nothing undone to sustain the high reputation which Mr. Van Horne has secured for entertaining the intimate mortals who are the guests of the Canadian Pacific road.

"18891216","December 11, In a blinding snowstorm today a heavily laden coal train on the Bnqnehanna road bound east came rumbling along toward the drawbridge at Little Ferry. The engineer, Wru Nixon, who was on the lookout, could see but a few rods ahead on account of the storm. The tracks are usually clear at this point and the train was moving at moderate speed. The draw of the bridge, which had been opened to permit the passage of a schooner, had not yet been closed. The engineer and fireman could not see this and no attempt was made to bring the train to a halt. The telegraph operator at the bridge heard the train coming and sprang to his instruments and began sending signals up the track to warn the men on the approaching train of the presence of danger. His wires connected with the alarm bells situated some distance up the track, and he kept them ringing until he saw the locomotive stick its nose through the storm. Then he realized that any effort he might make would be useless. As the train went by the operator looked at the engine cab and saw three men therein. They were Engineer Nixon, Fireman Harrington and the boss brakeman, William Seely. In an instant the locomotive reached the open draw and the forward end dived downwards and disappeared, taking the cab and tender with it. The coupling became unfastened and the first car remained on the brink of the bridge. No trace of the three men could be found. Bubbles caused by the escaping steam and hot ashes rose to the surface, but not a sign of life. The cars were transferred to the West Shore tracks and the relatives of the dead men, who lived in the West end, were notified of the sad occurrence.

St. Louis, December 15, The Post-Dispatch this morning printed under flaming headings a five column exposure of alleged legislative corruption at Jefferson City, Mo. It claims the Live Stock Inspection bill, introduced by the St. Louis Butchers union in the last Legislature, was defeated by the bribing of legislators. It is admitted by the friends of the measure that $3,000 were raised to be expended in support of the bill but that the money was to be used in bribing legislators is denied. It is claimed, however, that legislators sold out to butchers and then deserted their employers when the vote came on; that they met the agents of the dressed beef interest in bogus games of poker and pretended to win what was really a bribe. They openly negotiated for senatorial votes and disclosed that they were ready to vote for whichever side would pay the most. California's Destructive Flood, Maysville, Cal., December 15, The damage in the territory which was covered with water Friday has been materially added to by a subsequent rise of water from the Sacramento river this morning by the breaking of the Johnson levee. The Butte County Land Co.'s possessions and several thousand acres of less valuable lands were flooded. During Friday night and this morning the flood of water in the Tules made a rise of nearly two feet and flowed out over the land that had never been touched before. The loss to the grain crops in the water covered section is estimated at about a quarter million dollars. It is believed the worst is over. Electric Wire or Heart Disease, New York, December 14, Patrick Sullivan, aged 31, an employee of the Manhattan Electric Light company, was instantly killed this morning by an electric shock while at work in the company's building.

Sullivan's head and hand were burned by contact with a steam pipe. New York, December 15, An autopsy on the body of Patrick Sullivan, who was killed yesterday in the manhole under the basement of the Manhattan Electric Light company, proved that death was due to an electric shock.

Last week our sleighing met a sad turn rounding a corner at Gatineau Point; it struck a snag, and the bottom fell out of it. The country roads were bare for the past three weeks, and its effect on our markets told, with a harsh grating. The Ottawa was as open as in June. This was bad for our winter trots. On the 20th and 21st, everybody and his mother-in-law too united in prayer for a change.

"18900102","F. Pierson, chancellor of the Regents of the University of the State of New York, died suddenly today. He was born in 1841. A resident in the West Philadelphia area and a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences, he settled in Philadelphia. At St. Paul, Minn., January 1. Advices from there indicate that the great snowstorm of Saturday night raged over a very extended area. Rumors were rife in the newspaper offices that many trees west of here were down and travel was much delayed. The center of the disturbance appears to have been at Huron, S.D., where the wind veered to the north and the storm increased until it became a veritable blizzard, blowing fifty miles an hour. The memorable experiences of two years ago prevented people from unduly exciting themselves on the prairies, and no bad results were anticipated. The storm has been marked in places by singular phenomena. At Winona, Minn., rain descended in great sheets and the whole city was flooded. When the rain stopped, the mercury fell rapidly thirty degrees in three hours. People could skate to business in the morning. At other points, electrical disturbances preceded the fall of snow. Duluth was visited with a severe blizzard, ushering in the heaviest snowfall of the season. Much damage has been done in the city and streetcars are blockaded. Trains are delayed by drifts six feet deep in many places. Chicago, Ill., January 1. Chicago has experienced its first touch of winter this year. On Saturday the weather was very mild, the thermometer indicating about sixty degrees above zero. On Saturday night, a very peculiar meteorological condition obtained. While the temperature continued mild, the city was lashed by the tail end of a cyclone on a flying business trip from the Rocky Mountains to the valley of the St. Lawrence. House-shaking gusts of wind, rain-laden, went rattling by, making everything quiver and drenching the belated pedestrians. Five minutes later it would be as calm as a day in June and the heavens would be brilliant with stars, and these varying conditions were repeated again and again. The morning broke gray and dismal, with a heavy gale from the west, and before noon the mercury began to snuggle down toward the 1. At 7 o'clock in the morning, the temperature was sixty degrees; twelve hours later it was at twenty-eight, and Monday morning it was eighteen, showing a perpendicular plunge of over forty degrees in twenty-four hours. WINKLER, January 1. Today was observed very quietly here. The weather was blizzardy and the streets were almost deserted. The streetcars were out on runs today for the first time this winter. THE DEADLY GRIP. Spreading rapidly in Europe and causing many deaths. MADRID, January 1. The mortality here from influenza is very great, but the malady seems to be decreasing. Gayarre, the tenor, is not expected to recover. The disease is spreading in the provinces and has assumed a severe form at Barcelona. BERLIN, January 1. The rapid increase in the number of cases of influenza at Würzburg, Bavaria, has rendered necessary the erection of several temporary hospitals. There are 40,000 cases of the disease in Munich, and the epidemic is spreading in Pfretdrn. ROME, January 1. The influenza is prevailing in Italy. It has appeared at Verona. The pupils of the military school at Modena have been sent home. LONDON, January 1. Dr. Barnardo's homes for destitute and orphan children at Stepney are visited with great severity by the influenza, as is also the Jesuit college at Canterbury. VIENNA, January 1. Count Hegyenki and Conductor Richter have the influenza. In DUN, January 1. Sixty officials in the post office here have the influenza. A FAMOUS FEAT. The owner of the barquentine Juan was safe and sound on board the Red Star steamer Pennland when he arrived at quarantine from Antwerp. The Juan was abandoned at sea on December 20, after she had been reduced by the wind and waves to a waterlogged wreck. One of the Pennland's lifeboats was sacrificed in transferring the men to the Pennland. It was so badly damaged that it was rendered adrift. The Juan left St. John's, N.F., on November 30 with a cargo of fish oil for Glasgow. The first mishap was on December 3, when the standing jibstay was carried away. On the 6th, a heavy gale from the west-southwest compelled the vessel to heave to under close-reefed mainsail. A sea stove the forward starboard bulwarks and started the topgallant rail. On December 12, a southwest gale set in, and the Juan lay to until the 14th. She was then in latitude 50 degrees, longitude 28 degrees. At noon of that day, an enormous sea rolled over the little vessel, and C. Plene, a French sailor, was carried overboard by it. Capt. Cove ordered the fore and main rigging cut away, and also the foremast. The billow had split the mainsail and swept everything movable from the decks. The vessel's seams had parted and she was leaking two inches per hour. On the night of the 17th, a steamer passed, but ignored the Juan's distress signals. There was another southwest gale on the 19th, and oil was thrown over until night, when the crew were exhausted. The Pennland hove in sight at 8 o'clock next morning. The men had to be drawn aboard the Pennland's lifeboat through the water with lines. Warm food and drink and dry clothing were given to them on the Pennland, and Capt. Butchman was warmly thanked for his kindness. The Juan registered 130 tons and was owned at Kaloombe; she was partly insured. THE YEAR'S FIRST FIRES. A fire destroyed a factory at Trenton, N.J. NEW YORK, January 1. A fire, which originated in the Liberty Silk Works on West Fifty-Second Street today, caused a loss of $228,000. A large number of persons are thrown out of employment. THORNTON, Ont., January 1. A fire broke out last night about 8 p.m. in the sash factory of T. Skelton, which was totally destroyed. Loss about $3,000. The building was insured. The factory had been idle for some time, and Mr. Skelton had just completed improvements to begin tomorrow. The loss is heavy. There is no insurance on machinery. The origin of the fire is unknown. A TRAGIC ACT Nearly Causes a Tragedy in Rome. King Humbert Believes in Peace. ROME, January 1. The King, replying to the congratulations of the parliamentary deputation today, said: ""There was a time when I would not have ventured to guarantee peace for a fortnight, but now peace is secured by the good understanding between Germany and Russia."" As the parliamentary deputation was leaving the palace, a man threw among the deputies a copper box, to which was attached a burning fuse. It was extinguished and no damage done. The man was arrested. He said he was a McMillan, that his name was Vila, and that his motive was revenge for injustice done by the Government. A Memorial for Merry. WINDSOR, Ont., January 1. Eleven of the hit men who tried McMillan at Chatham for the murder of Wilton Holton state, in a document which has been forwarded to the Minister of Justice, that when they rendered a verdict of guilty they had no idea the judge would be compelled to pass sentence of death upon the prisoner, and that while they believe McMillan to have been implicated in the crime, they do not believe him guilty of having killed Wilton. They think that in fact he was not the actual instigator. BEN BUTTERWORTH'S BILL To Bring About Unrestricted Reciprocity Reintroduced."
"18900107","PACIFIC COAST STORIES, Drolls light near Fruit-Winters Canyon, I co inert the ""Now"" Line's Cat Hales Mel, Washington, January 6, In the Senate today Mr. Call offered a long preamble and resolution in regard to the Island of Cuba, and asked for immediate action. It states that there is reason to believe that the debt of that Island, as consolidated by the decree of the Queen of Spain on May 10, 1880 ($121,000,000 at 6 per cent), is now in the hands of German bankers and subject to the control, more or less actual and direct, of the Government of the German Empire; that by a subsequent decree, dated November 10, 1886, such debt was converted into a new one bearing less interest but for a larger amount, and is subject to the same conditions and guarantees; that this debt is secured by special mortgage of the customs revenue of the Island of Cuba, and of all taxes, direct or indirect; that, under the ordinary course of events and the financial condition of both Cuba and Spain, it is more than probable that neither Cuba nor Spain will be able to meet their obligations and to pay off either principal or interest when they become due; that, under these circumstances and for all practical purposes, the political as well as the financial control of the island of Cuba has been transferred to the Government of the German Empire; that the immediate consequence of such a state of affairs is an alliance between Spain and Germany, not less binding and powerful because of its being unwritten, whereby the German Government becomes interested in assisting Spain to perpetuate her sovereignty in Cuba, thus interfering with the historical laws and principles which must rule in the American hemisphere; that such a condition of things is not only contrary to the traditional policy of the United States and to its most cherished tenets, but constitutes a menace to the best interests of the United States, as well as to the best interests of the whole sisterhood of American republics. The resolution declares, therefore, that in the sense of the Senate everything done or attempted to be done in the Island of Cuba, finding in any way whatever to transfer the financial and political control of Cuba to any European power is contrary to the policy and to the best interests of the United States and must be discountenanced and protested against. It also requests the President to furnish the Senate such information as may be in possession of the State Department in regard to the matter so as to enable the Senate in its executive capacity, otherwise, to take such action as may be deemed proper under the circumstances. Mr. Sherman objected to the present consideration of the resolution unless it is to have it referred to the committee on foreign relations. Mr. Call I have no objection to that reference. The resolution was then referred to the committee on foreign relations. The ""Friendly Incident Bears Fruit"", Washington, January 6, The following bills were introduced in the House today: By Mr. Stewart, Georgia - Requesting the executive departments to change the extradition laws with Great Britain, so that persons charged with grand larceny, embezzlement and other crimes may be extradited from Canada; By Mr. Springer For the admission of Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico and Wyoming into the United States; By Mr. Reagan To prevent transportation of merchandise in bond from the ports and territories of the United States into the Republic of Mexico, and to restore that privilege when the issue along the boundary between the two countries is abolished. A New National Bank Bill! New York, January 6, John Jay Knox, president of the National Bank of the Republic, of this city, has prepared a bill to be introduced in Congress providing for a permanent national bank circulation. The bill provides for the issue of bank circulation in an amount not exceeding 75 per cent of the capital of each bank. Seventy per cent of this circulation is to be secured by the deposit of United States bonds at par or silver bullion at the market price. The other 30 per cent is not to be secured by a deposit of each bank, but by a safety fund on deposit with the United States Treasurer. Great Storm on the Pacific Coast, San Francisco, January 6, The storm has caused great damage to the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company's road. Three accidents have been reported. Fireman Cross was scalded at Wood River yesterday, and fireman Orvis was killed in a collision between a freight and passenger train near Willows last night. It is rumored that two men were killed and thirteen persons injured on the same road at Ulpanguera, but this is not confirmed. The first train from Spokane in five days arrived today. Eight engines have been demolished on this road. The heaviest snowstorm in years prevails. A Train Runs Through a Bridge, Weiser, Idaho, January 6, Yesterday a construction train, with about twenty men on board, was crossing Sherwood bridge, when the derrick caught the bridge cover, and the next instant the bridge broke down, plunging the train into the creek. Grant Milliken's neck was broken, Daniel Howard was struck on the head and instantly killed, Cornelius Ditlenhofer had an arm and leg crushed and is fatally injured. The balance were taken out more or less badly hurt, but it is likely all will recover. His Body Found in a Saloon, Pueblo, Colo., January 6, Carson Parker was found dead in a south side saloon yesterday. For years one of the most eminent preachers of the Methodist church in New York City, he became a drunkard and wandered to Pueblo, reformed and again joined the church. His reformation lasted a year, during which time he did editorial work and demonstrated rare ability. His last fall was complete, all his friends proving useless. He leaves a family in Indiana. Murders by Mexican Horse Thieves, Four Davis, Tex., January 6, A band of Mexican horse thieves ambushed a camping party of three men, two women and four children, in a canyon near Chihuahua, Saturday, and shot and killed two of the men. The murderers told the remainder of the party they supposed them to be officers. A military squad was sent to arrest the Mexicans, and if captured they will be summarily dealt with. A Jump to Save Their Lives, Tiawahita, Kan, January 6, Fire was discovered in the principal hotel early this morning and guests were obliged to jump from the second and third story windows to save their lives. A number of persons were injured, but none fatally. Rev. Mr. Joiner at Myth, Harkins, N.C., January 6, The New and Observer states that after making a thorough examination it has failed to ascertain that such a person as Rev. J., January 6, Dr. Kniffon, whose wife was chloroformed to death the other night by someone unknown, took an ounce of aconite and gashed his wrists and throat with a razor at his home this morning. He will live. He says he attempted to take his life because he was discouraged at the strong tide of public feeling against him. A Fatal Arch Cave-In, New York, January 6, While thirty bricklayers were working on the arch in the Hudson River tunnel, early yesterday morning, a great mass of mud caved in. All the men got safely into the air lock with the exception of Christopher Nelson. Both Nelson's legs and arms were broken and his body badly crushed. He was finally dragged into the air lock. His injuries are fatal. Will Meet the ""Moo"" Line Again, St. Paul, January 6, Another reduction in through rates to New England and Canadian points was announced by the Burlington road today, to take effect January 6. The basis of the rates is the same as those quoted by the Soo line to become effective tomorrow, $22.00 first class, and $20.00 second class to Boston. The Window Glass Trust Formed, Boston, January 6, It is said the American Window Glass trust has been formed at Pittsburgh. The twelve largest American importers of window glass met here the past week and agreed upon an advance of 10 per cent. Prices abroad have risen about 30 per cent because of the advance in raw materials. Blowing Up by Naphtha, Lima, Ohio, January 6, One of the thousand barrel stills of the Naphtha works exploded today. Win. Culver, foreman, was found insensible, cut and burned. Peter Devine, a brick mason, had a leg broken and was badly burned. Both may die; seven others were burned, but not seriously. Plath's Men, the Renowned Here, Washington, January 6, Assistant Secretary Thelenor has informed a correspondent that there is no provision of law which would authorize the admission free of duty of old planks from Canada for the purpose of being renovated and returned to that country. California's Snow Blockade, Sacramento, Cal., January 6, The snowstorm in the Sierra Nevada mountains has abated and the Central Pacific railroad over the mountains is now cleared and travel resumed. For the present, however, freight trains will not move. Coffee Prices Here Rise Higher, Baltimore, January 6, A prominent coffee dealer here claims to have a dispatch from Brazil stating that the new government has increased the export duty on coffee from 11 to 12 per cent.

"18900108","THE SEASONS CHANGING, An Amelioration of the Winter's Reverses in the Lower Provinces, (Mr. John Globe) It is quite evident to every observer of our seasons that the character of our winters has become very different from what it was even a few years ago. In this district of the province, and indeed, all along the shores of the Bay of Fundy, both in New Brunswick and in Nova Scotia, the winter is much milder and more open now than it used to be when our middle-aged men were boys. Then, we used to have heavy snowstorms and long continued spells of severely cold weather. Now we seldom have more than three or four cold days in succession, and most of our snowstorms are followed by heavy falls of rain. There seems to be a good deal in the theory advanced to account for these results, that they are produced by a deflection of the Gulf Stream towards our shores, bringing nearer to us a great continuous flow of warmer water. Not only here, but all along the Atlantic coast of North America, the present winter has been, so far as it has advanced, most remarkable for its mildness. We in St. John have, in truth, had but four or five really cold days; and we have had no snow worth speaking of lying in our streets or anywhere in the adjacent country. And the genial warmth and softness of the season has been even more remarkable along the coasts of the Southern States. At San Antonio, in Texas, as letters received here a few days ago inform us, they were, just before Christmas, eating beautiful ripe strawberries that had grown in the open air, and were picking from the bushes in their garden, splendid and fragrant roses. We no longer wonder at such luxurious and exceptional enjoyments when our correspondent informs us a little further on in his letter that, as he was writing, at 1 o'clock p.m., the thermometer was standing at 85.9 Fahrenheit, in the shade, a degree which we seldom reach in our hottest summer weather. A Popular Bank Official Dead, The many friends of Mr. Harry King, for over fifteen years connected with the Bank of British North America in this city, will be grieved at the news of his death which occurred last evening after a long illness from consumption. The deceased, who was only in his thirty-seventh year, was highly connected in England, was most popular with the officials and employees of the bank, and was generally esteemed on account of his sterling character. Dissolution of Partnership, The co-partnership heretofore existing between the undersigned and the late THOMAS WORKMAN, under the name of FROTHINGHAM & WORKMAN, is this day dissolved consequent on the death of Mr. Workman, on the 8th October last. HENRY ATCHISON, EDWARD HURT, GEORGE W. EADIE, Montreal, 31st December, 1880. CO-PARTNERSHIP NOTICE, The undersigned have this day entered into partnership as Iron, Steel and Hardware Merchants, and will continue the business of the late firm of FROTHINGHAM & WORKMAN under the same name, and on the premises heretofore occupied by the late firm.

"18900113","IIKIEFS Who will carry off that green steeplechase tonight? Twenty thousand wheels, it is said, have been ordered by American dealers from English makers for 1890. Senator Morgan is at present sporting editor of the Sunday Mercury and Portland Times, of Portland, Oregon. There was to have been a trotting race at the Driving Park on Saturday, but the snowstorm spoiled all that. The Stanley Cycle Show, in Crystal Palace, London, England, will commence January 28, and continue until February 4, 1890. If the authorities at Clifton and Guttenburg decide to give jumping races, several Canadian titlists will visit the Jersey courses. Kily Chicago Traded les Bla; Whlltn Mill at Auction-Victim of the Caisson Horror. St. Louis, January 12. About half past four this afternoon a cyclone struck the southwestern section of the city and swept on to the northern limits, marking a pathway nearly a quarter of a mile wide and leaving death and destruction in its trail. There was scarcely any warning of the approaching storm, as the sky had been overcast several hours before the full force of wind was felt and it was all over in an incredibly brief time. Those residing in and near the path of the cyclone scarcely realized what had happened until it was all over. In addition to dozens of dwellings and stores on the southern, central and northern sections of the city, more or less wrecked, the following big buildings were damaged: The Anchor Mills, Goodwin Candle Factory, Pullman Shops, Van Brock's Furniture Factory, King Island and Ferguson Farm Implement Works, Missouri Pacific Hospital, Hodgen School, Uman Evangelical Church and Second Presbyterian Church. There are others yet to hear from. It was reported that another section of the Academy of Music, which collapsed recently, had been leveled by the storm, but this is now denied. Three fatalities are reported, but the names of the victims have not been ascertained. They comprise an entire family, father, mother and child, residing on Mound Street, and they met their deaths by the falling of their dwelling. The loss on property is roughly estimated at $100,000. Mrs. Chas. Miller, who resided with her husband at Twentieth and Eugenia Streets, was sitting in a rocking chair with her babe in arms when the roof was lifted from her house. She rushed to the windows. The wall gave way and Mrs. Miller and the babe were buried under the debris. The babe miraculously escaped without a scratch, but the mother is badly hurt and may not recover. A telephone message from Venice, Ill., opposite the northern part of the city, says that the storm was very disastrous there and several lives were lost. The Dead and Injured. The list of victims secured up to 9:30 p.m. are as follows: DEAD, MARGARET CONNOR, aged 40; LAILA McCANN, aged 40; JERK WEAVER, aged 30. INJURED, Teresa Weaver, aged 6, both legs broken, will probably die; Mr. Chas. Miller, badly cut and bruised; A. J. Connor, no details. A wrecking crew from the east side of the river says the storm in St. Clair County, Ill., was unusually severe and the cry ""Good Lord save us!"" was heard frequently outside of church walls. Nearly Swept Off the Earth. At 8 p.m. it was reported in east St. Louis that the village of Brooklyn had been swept off the face of the earth; it proves not quite so bad as that, though several were injured. No lives were lost. A number of dwellings are in ruins. The Baptist Church is entirely demolished and the Methodist Episcopal Church, a frame building, unroofed and turned clear around on its foundations. At Belleville, Ill., several public buildings were unroofed, but no one reported injured. The storm in Water Plane, Bay City, Mich., January 12. In the storm today the Episcopal and Presbyterian churches and Bullentine's livery stable were blown down. Omaha, Neb., January 12. A snowstorm has been raging here since early this morning. There are drifts two to four feet high in the streets. A Chicago Street Car Tragedy. Chicago, January 12. While collecting fares on a State Street car today, Conductor Moore received from George Jordan (colored) a $1 bill. In return he gave his passenger three 25-cent pieces and two dimes. ""One of these quarters is no good,"" said Jordan, ""I do not want it."" ""All right, here you are,"" returned Moore, as he took back the objectionable coin and counted out twenty-five one-cent pieces. ""Are you trying to make a monkey of me?"" yelled Jordan, with an oath, ""I'm no chump!"" The irate darkey rose and violently struck Moore in the face. Moore stepped to the rear platform. Jordan, fearing the conductor intended attacking him with a car hook, drew a revolver, and taking deliberate aim fired. The ball lodged in Moore's lung, inflicting a fatal wound. Jordan was arrested. The Alaska Seal Fiasco. Washington, January 12. The most important progress in the work of legislation in Congress is still shown in the committee stage. Senator Plumb will address the Senate tomorrow upon his resolution requesting the Secretary of the Treasury to postpone the releasing of the Alaska seal until further relief by Congress, or until the latest period made necessary by law, and that he inform the Senate how the Alaska Commercial Company has discharged its obligations under the present law and what additional legislation is needed to protect the interests of the Government and of the inhabitants of Alaska. Victims of the Caisson Horror. Louisville, January 12. Three more bodies were taken out at the wrecked caisson yesterday. The first was Monroe Bowling, who was lying uppermost at the bottom entrance of the air shaft. It was noon when Bowling's body was sufficiently loosened to be drawn out. At 1:30 Thomas Smith's body, which, with Thob Honor's, was wedged in the very entrance of the shaft, was drawn out. The operation was difficult on account of air pressing up and closing the door and escaping. Much air escaped while Smith was being extricated, and it required an hour more of pumping before Hope's body could be gotten out. Thomas Aih was taken out late at night. His body was pulled in two. Woolen Mills at Auction. Providence, R.I., January 11. The attempt to settle the affairs of the Riverside and Oswego Mills Company at 60 cents on the dollar, or 78 cents 50 cents cash and the balance in stock has failed, and the assignees have ordered a sale at auction February 6, of the vast property at Olneyville, which comprises one of the finest woolen goods plants in the world. This is thought to be a test of the strength of the Ballard party as against the Chaplins. It is reported that the mill, employing nearly 1,000 hands, will not be shut down. Murdered Woman. Chicago, January 11. While walking along the street last night with John Haines, James Prendergast suddenly turned and ran a long knife into Haines' heart. The assailant then withdrew the weapon and, laughingly said, ""That went through him."" Haines expired on the sidewalk before the eyes of half a dozen horror-stricken people. Prendergast, for the time being, escaped but was captured soon after by the police. The men had been rivals for three years for the favor of a certain woman. Long Island Sound Steamer Ashore. New London, January 12. The steamer City of Worcester went on the rocks about one-third of a mile west of Bartlett's Reef lightship this morning. The first compartment is all tight, but there are 5 to 7 feet of water in the second, third and fourth compartments. The other two watertight compartments are not injured. The steamer lies easily. Tragedy of a Steamer. Utica, N.Y., January 12. The steamer Portia all right. (From our own correspondent.) St. John, N.H., January 12. Some fears were entertained for the steamship Portia, but she has arrived all right at Yarmouth. She ran off from the coast because of a snowstorm and thick vapor. Mrs. Alex. Austin was burned to death today through her clothes catching fire from a stove. She was 50 years old. The provincial nominations are tomorrow. There will be a very hot fight in St. John, York and Westmorland, and opposition in all but three counties. Smuggling Farmers Taught a Lesson. Windsor, Ont., January 11. A special officer has just returned from a trip down the lakeshore in the vicinity of Oley, and has impressed very forcibly upon some of the farmers the necessity of their complying with the customs laws. Over $5,000 was taken from them. Those pounced upon are all prominent farmers and smuggling has been going on for some time. They would sail up to Detroit in their own small boats, buy what they wanted and go home the same way. Another raid at Wellandburg."
"18900116","K. Murchison. The funeral of the late Mr. Kenneth Murchison, for the last few years of Winnipeg, and formerly of Montreal, whose death at Winnipeg was announced a few days ago, took place at Williamstown yesterday and was largely attended. Many of those who had been friends of his father braved the snowstorm to pay the last tribute of respect to the son of their old neighbor. There were present friends from Winnipeg, Ottawa, Cornwall, and Montreal, amongst the latter being Messrs. James McIlwain and Alex. Lockett. St. Ann's Young Men's Society. The annual meeting of the St. Ann's Young Men's Society was held last evening, Rev. Father Strubbe in the chair, when the following officers were elected for the ensuing year: Spiritual director, Rev. Father Strubbe; president, Mr. J. J. Bethling; first vice-president, Mr."
"18900117","SOME OF THOSE PRESENT: Legislation Foreshadowed by the Government in the Speech from the Throne The New Members (From our own correspondent) Ottawa, January 16 The fourth session of the sixth Parliament of the Dominion of Canada was formally opened this afternoon by His Excellency the Governor-General with all the pomp and splendor inherent to such an occasion. The morning opened with a heavy snowstorm, and there were fears that the brilliancy of the gathering would be spoiled, but the presiding genius up above was kind. About noon the sun broke through the clouds, and by 1 o'clock we had a taste of regular Queen's weather. The rush to obtain seats to witness the ceremonials in the Senate was almost unprecedented, everybody who is anybody or thinks they are seeming to want to be present. As a result the position of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod was for once decidedly unpleasant. The arrival of the Governor-General was fixed for three o'clock, but long before that hour crowds of people, especially ladies, passed through the big gates on Wellington Street and climbed the hill to the main entrance of the building, whence they speedily made their way to the Senate. There they were met by Dominion policemen in natty uniforms, who vigorously inspected their tickets of admission, and any unfortunate individual lacking a cardboard open sesame had to be content with witnessing whatever ceremony took place outside. Arrival of His Excellency The galleries of the Senate were soon filled to excess by early arrivals who whiled away the time before the ceremony by watching the arrival of the invited guests on the floor below and commenting upon the beautiful costumes of the ladies. Sharp as the bells of the clock on the tower pealed out the hour of three, the report of a cannon signaled the arrival of His Excellency. A salute of nineteen guns was fired from Nepean Point by a detachment of the Ottawa Field Battery under command of Captain Bliss. The Governor-General, who had been escorted from Rideau Hall by twenty troopers of the Princess Louise Dragoon Guards, was received by a general salute from the guard of honor drawn from the Governor General's Foot Guards, the playing of the first few bars of the national anthem, and the lowering of the regimental colors. He was accompanied by Captain Colville, military secretary, and Captain McMahon."

BUFFETED BY GREAT GALES, A French Brigantine's Crew Rescued Just in the Nick of Time, THE AWFUL EXPERIENCES From About the Newfoundland Banks for the Wrecks - The Polynesian's Metrical Arrival, (From our own correspondent) Halifax, January 28, The Allan steamer Polynesian, Captain Wylie, arrived at 5 o'clock this morning with the mails from Liverpool, making one of the best passages of the ocean-going vessel to this port since the gales commenced. She experienced strong westerly gales with tremendous seas, which washed her decks on many occasions. The vessel's rigging was badly iced up. A stirring incident occurred Sunday morning when through the great bravery of Chief Officer Fairfull, with a crew of six men, a gallant and heroic rescue was made of the crew of a sinking vessel which had been sighted at 1 a.m. flying signals of distress. The Polynesian bore down on her and a boat was immediately launched. The derelict vessel's rails were under water. A Plaything of the Tempest, Her masts were standing, but her main boom was gone and her sails were all in shreds, except her lower topsail, while all her headgear was hanging over her bow. The vessel proved to be the brigantine Mathilda, of Nantes, from Martinique, bound to St. Pierre. Captain Boudrain and the crew, seven in number, were placed safely on the Polynesian. The Mathilda had a terrible experience. She left Martinique on December 5, in ballast, for St. Pierre, and arrived off the banks January 4, over three weeks ago. She bore up for St. Pierre, but encountered a tremendous southwest gale and was unable to make the port. Trying to Make a Haven, The gale continued without abatement for a week, accompanied by tremendous seas, which washed over her decks and at times threatened to destroy the vessel. The weather moderated slightly on the 11th and an effort was made to reach St. John's, but another gale commenced with violent seas and the effort was unsuccessful as the seas, which were breaking over her, could not be headed. Two days later they again hauled up for St. Pierre but they met with heavy ice, closely packed, in which the vessel received a severe shock and commenced to make water rapidly. They got out of the ice the next morning when they made land, but a blinding snowstorm prevented them from reaching port. A Sailing Death or Rescue, Tremendous gales were being experienced and the vessel stood off to sea again, but on the 18th she again made land, but the wind was so strong that she could not beat up against it and they lay hove to until the 21st, awaiting death or rescue. For six days they remained anxiously waiting this, when the Polynesian hove in sight. Their sufferings during the time can scarcely be imagined. They had no water and had run so short of provisions that they had only a few biscuits remaining. The terrible gales and heavy seas had been accompanied by extremely cold weather and many of them had their hands and feet frozen, while some of them were lightly clad and in no wise clothed to stand such weather."

Friday A consolation and the five-mile duel, with a flock of eight. Harrison will have all his qualities as an engineer, and Studacona's staying powers fully tested. The combination mile after mile will give him a turn, and for a come home Dot Ross will take the call. A good sharp track, barring all accidents, and Studacona will make it a hot turn for the best of them. If the weather clerk will just for the next week let up on his frolics and give a show for fine weather, at the close he can open the flood gates. The entry list is a strong one, but the ones on paper don't always score. The destiny of the champion medals may now be classed in the hidden mysteries. At Hull we are again in a wind gale. It's a perfect whistler and the sports at the Ridtuu have a gay time. No man could tell which trap is to be pulled. Old Probs wins; he has beat the club for the first time. Deslaurier says: Boys, it's Prof. Sir Stone Wiggins' and Benj. Cawthray's doing, that's what it is. They have fixed this crooked deal just to get even with the newspaper boys. They've soured on all interviewers. The Professor hits a brick on his desk; he's ready for the vandal; Sir Benj. has a hay-fork, a genuine three-toed toaster at the gate. He's dangerous, and to be severely left alone. The attendance was good, a really cheerful crowd, and the events were fully up to the mark at Leumy's lake. Saturday landed here the known export in trotting matters, Mr. Alf Brown; he is here to hold the ribbons over Nelly Woods. The Toronto owners have discovered that the nut at the wheel had to be shifted, and as Nelly is in for a whirl at the 2:20 class, for $150 out of the $275 purse, and again shows up for another $150 in the five-mile purse of $125, she would require an engineer, hence the presence of Alf. Talk about the glorious climate of CIL foioy; it ain't a marker; we can double discount it, that is, for a crooked deal. Another cold snowstorm is now upon me at the close of day. The 2:50 class was first on the bill, and the time may be set down already good, when the now so-called track is considered four turns for a mile. It's an outrage on the boast, and the man who drives a horse for a race on such a track has but poor respect for the animal. He is unworthy as an owner. I know not from what cause this state of all things has arisen, but the track today was no tuck; the open road would have been preferable, shape every joint disjointed. The contest, as per summary, shows a hot race. The fourth heat a dead win, exulting and sent the crowd wild. Following is the summary: 2:50 class."

The Glasgow era states that the Thistle is to be changed to a yawl rig, but has gone to the yard of the Henderson Brothers, Partick, to have her rig altered so that she will appear next season as a cutter of 25-rating. She will have a new suit of sails by Aspthorn & Ratsey. As the Thistle's old sails are good enough for cruising purposes, it is evident, from her having a new suit, that her owner intends to race. Whether James Bell, her present owner, will be satisfied to race with the new 84-foot Jameson cutter is a question. Mr. Bell has always had an itch to have another shy at the America Cup with the Thistle, and it would not be very surprising if the defeated challenger of 1888 should again champion the Clyde racing float. JIST11, Opinion of Trolling Club Events, Special to the Gazette, Ottawa, February 18. Monday the weather opened by far too fine to last. At noon the change came, and with it a sort of misty, drizzling half sleet, half rain and snow, just enough to make those who enjoy the bonnie blythe blink of a fireside. Till noon the break does not improve. The cold is not so intense, but the air is full of a fine sort of a sand snowstorm. It is uncomfortable; just such a day one would prefer a chair in Carslake's and have a friendly banter over ""the day's long gone John,"" than to prance up and down, stamping one's feet vigorously on the frozen surface to keep up circulation. Then after a heat, with no shed or shelter, the other animal, poor brute, has no voice in this work; his voice is in his muscular action, in his staying qualities. By noon the snow damper and thicker fills the air, and we are right in an old-fashioned winter blast. This means trouble at the track. The scrapers must be kept at work; if not, slow time will mark the events. This hot rid state of weather has continued all day and now, at 5 p.m., a man would be almost heartless to put a good dog out in the storm. And yet in the face of this, the attendance was really good. Though every effort was put forth by the club to clear the track, the beautiful came too thick and made the track heavy. In the 2:50 class, Jimcrack dropped out. There was a big field of ten starters. In the pools, Royal Jim was a good favorite at $20, and the nine went for $5. The take was not a big one. The first heat went to Royal Jim. He then grew a favorite in the pools, but Minnie was too much for the string. In the last heat, Peter Morris was put up behind Jim, but he could not get there. 2:50 class summary: B."
"18900222","TKOTTIKO, Trolling at the Cnnthiil, (Special to the Gazette) Ottawa, February 20 Hard luck, in a fiendish form, pursues and interviews all sorts of the Ottawa Trotting Club. There will be no trots today. To call this the worst snowstorm of the season would be an error. We have had so many of the worst that to call this such looks a stale chestnut. This is just the tail end of the last one, and age has added the full vigor of manhood to its majestic form. At 2:30 this am, a strong east gale, with snow, burst upon us; and now, 11 am, the ""beautiful"" still comes down. No matter how much effort may be put forth it will be impossible to have a track open for trots today. A 1:40 class, with 14 entries as per advertised list, and a free-for-all, with 5. Then that 1:33 class. The judges, at the close yesterday, when Flynn objected to the selection of an honest, square man Robert Stewart taking the ribbons in hand and giving Goldie a show, spoiled all the fakirs' dream of doing up the crowd by going to rules and declaring all pools and bets off. It was a grand coup. The crowd cheered and the fakirs made the atmosphere blue with cuss words. The judges were right, and such men in the box is the only great redeeming feature of this meeting. Ottawa, February 21 The races at the St. Louis Dam track this afternoon attracted 1,500 people. Both the free-for-all and 2:40 classes were unfinished. The following is the summary of both. Last in the Minranni Hat, irAx, February 21 During the terrible snowstorm last night Captain Archibald McKatherine, steamboat keeper and watchman at the railroad wharf at Port Hawkesbury, is supposed to have lost his way and perished. Notice of him has yet been discovered. Kew Post, February 21 Rev. Mr. McLend has been appointed postmaster here to fill the vacancy made by the death of Patrick McPetrike. ""Women with pale, colorless faces, who feel weak and disheartened, will receive both the mist and bracing vigor by using Carter's Iron Pills, which are made for the blood, tissues, and complexion. THE GOVERNMENT OUTLOOK It Should Have a Majority Lord Tennyson III - The Pendulum of Diet Parliament, February 21 The weather yesterday was pleasant. There was tremendous voting in the afternoon. One great point in the vote in Berlin was the complete absence of the anti-Semitic faction. The indications are that the Deutsch Freintiny party may secure the first two seats in Berlin and it is not unlikely that this party will lose all others throughout the country. The great fact of the election is the enormous and unexpected increase in the Socialist vote. The Socialist vote in Berlin is increased to 280,000, the Deutsch Freintiny 3,000 and the Conservatives have lost 34,000. The election of two Socialists in this city is certain. In four districts no candidate has a majority. Socialists Double their Vote The latest apparent result is that the Government parties have lost 15 seats and the Socialists throughout Germany have doubled their vote. Liebknecht and Singer (Socialists) are elected. The latter defeated Kuge, the leader of the Liberal party. Kittler, however, was elected for Langen. Singer is the man whose libel case satirized the Schwaburger Zeitung made a great deal of noise in December. He gained his case and the editor was compelled to pay a fine. This fine the Emperor remitted, using his royal prerogative to set aside the verdict of a court of justice. This made a great sensation and Singer's candidacy became a rallying center for protest against such an abuse of power. In Hamburg the Socialists Hile, Diets and Metzger are elected. More Socialist victories, Gillemberger, Schmidt, Seifart and Hurt, Socialists, have been elected to the Reichstag in Nuremberg, Mittweida, Hohenberg, and Klberfeld respectively. The returns thus far received show the election of 3 Conservatives, 2 members of the Imperial party, 18 members of the Centre party, 20 Liberals, 14 Socialists, 1 National-Liberal, 2 Poles and 2 Alsatians. Returns have also been received from 70 other districts. In four of these the polls were headed by Conservatives, in 3 by members of the Imperial party, in 17 by National-Liberals, in 10 by members of the Centre party, in 16 by Liberals, in 23 by Socialists, in 2 by Guilds and in 1 by an Alsatian, but second ballots will be necessary, as a majority is required to elect. Compared with the last preceding election the Socialist vote in Berlin shows an increase of 33,000 and the Liberal vote an increase of 9,000. The Conservative vote decreased 35,000. In three districts second ballots are necessary. The Socialists carried Mindenburg, Altmark, Hamburg, the Posen district, the Leijute district, Chemnitz, and Seewalden. The Government in a Fix, Twenty Socialists are known to be elected. Socialists will also contest thirty-three districts in which secret ballots are necessary. The Centre party and the Liberals hold their ground. The Cartel parties have sustained severe losses. The National, Hung estimates from the returns thus far received that the Cartel parties have already lost eighteen seats. The paper says that owing to these losses of the Cartel parties the Government will be unable to secure a majority in the Reichstag. The Central Returns Monument The returns thus far account for 234 seats in the Reichstag. This leaves 63 seats to be accounted for. Of the 231 the election failed in 62 districts, making supplementary military elections necessary. The 142 members elected comprise: German Conservatives, 22; Imperialists, 10; National Liberals, 6; Centrists, 62; German Liberals, 11; Socialists, 20; Poles, 3; Alsatians, 10; Democrats, 3; Huns, 1; Independent Liberals, 1. The ninety-two districts in which there were no elections will be contested by Conservatives, 11 Imperialists, 13; National Liberals, 6; Socialists, 14; German Liberals, 30; Socialists, 4; Guilds, 2; Poles, 4; Democrats, 6. The Chicago Tribune reckons that the Cartel combination has lost twenty-seven seats. Soldiers and Socialists Collide (Via Dalziel's Cable News Agency) Antona, February 21 Cavalry with drawn sabres and infantry with fixed bayonets were posted on the Hamburg frontier to prevent the meetings of the Socialists. The Socialists constantly cheered the soldiers, who finally charged them, severely wounding eight civilians.

The Fight for the Fair, Washington, February 23, The eve of the great free-for-all race for the World's Fair has been used by the friends of the four contestants in getting into the best position for the opening tomorrow and in arranging plans and counterplans. It is on all hands conceded that Chicago will bring dramatically to the front, and that the Lake City will capture the first heat, but there is a wide difference of opinion and a great amount of uncertainty as to how many heats it will require for any one of the four rivals to distance her competitors. There is speculation as to whether any fair will be held. The opposition to the holding of a fair is gaining ground, and many predict that a formidable array of members will be found opposed to any fair before a site is chosen. The Meetings the Other Day, Jackson, Miss, February 23, Minority and majority reports were made by the legislative committee appointed to examine into the office of state treasurer. The reports do not differ materially. They express the opinion that when ex-Treasurer Hemingway is credited with $1,685 paid out by him for coupons in 1870, and for which no entry can be found on his general books, it will be found that the state owes him over $2,000. Put Dynamite Into the Stove, Penn Pa, February 23, W. M. Crock, of Adamsburg, took to his home this afternoon a stock of dynamite and placed it in the stove today. In ten minutes a terrific explosion occurred, the kitchen was wrecked and a piece of the stove shot into an adjoining room, striking Wm. Steinets on the breast and killing him. Flying missiles struck Crock and his wife and child, who were in the room, and it is thought they were fatally hurt.

It is reported Sir Francis Knollys, private secretary to the Prince of Wales, was Labouchere's informant. The Star (O'Connor's paper) commenting on the proceedings in relation to the Cleveland Street Scandal, says the Liberals intend to protest against Mr. Labouchere's suspension in such a manner as to deter the chairman from making such a ruling. The Star also accuses the Government of culpable remissness in enabling titled criminals to escape punishment for connection with the Scandal. The Pall Mall Gazette demands of Lord Hulbury the appointment of a commission of enquiry to decide who is to blame for the escape of the criminals. The Globe denounces Labouchere for his insolence and says his political trade led him to endeavor to conjoin the Government with a nauseous scandal and to pose as a hero and martyr. London, March 1, Earl Spencer, speaking at Wolverton today, reproved the Times for its gullibility in swallowing so readily Pigott's forged letters, which were, in fact, the backbone of all its charges. He said whenever, during the last 15 years, enquiry into the doings or payings of anybody connected with Dublin Castle had elicited any communication from Pigott, what he said had always been found to be unreliable. He related instances of Pigott's attempts to obtain money for pretended information while he himself was Lord Lieutenant. He said, ""If the Gladstonians are now worthy of blame for their alliance with the Parnell party, the Tories were also worthy of blame for the alliance of 1885 and 1886, and for the present offers of local government to Ireland."" He believed posterity would regard Mr. Parnell as one of the greatest reformers of the generation. Bimla Is NnsiilclmiH, JImimv, March 2, The Keiclaanzciijer (official) says the questions to be considered by the labor conference have no political significance. Therefore, it is best that it be limited to the experts of the conference to decide whether the regulations made shall be laid down for execution. It also recommends that they decide whether there shall be future and periodical conferences of the same nature. The St. Petersburg Gazette comments on what it considers the lack of wisdom shown by the powers that have consented to take part in the conference. The conference, the paper believes, will tend to add economic superiority to the military preponderance already exercised by Germany over Europe and it is on this ground that it censures the powers for giving their support to the project. Louise Michel As A Librettist, (Dul, ""lol's Cable News"") Paris, March 1, Louise Michel, the communist, has just sold the libretto of a comic opera called ""Vie dans la Lune"" for two thousand francs.

When the third section of a freight train going east reached that point, an oil tank on the train exploded and set fire to the cars. The fourth section ran into the third, killing John Cowen, engineer, Harvey Galehouse, fireman, and Miller, the front brakeman, all on the fourth section. Eighteen loaded cars were burned. The heat was so intense that it melted the bell in the engine of the fourth section, and it ran down in molten form over the boiler. The ties were burned for a distance of 1,500 feet and the track was bent and drawn into all kinds of shapes. Cowen and Miller lived at Alliance and had families. Galehouse was a single man.

Just what plan they will adopt has not been determined upon, but they declare they will trade in produce in spite of anything the board of trade may do. The telegraph officials do not wish to say anything about the matter, but they are largely interested in the fight. It means the loss of a great business by the companies if the board succeeds in its present intentions, unless they can meet the contingency in some manner. A bitter fight is in prospect.

A LIVELY DEBATE In the House of Commons on the Parnell-Commission Report, London, March 6. In the House of Commons this evening the debate on the Parnell Commission report was resumed by Professor Bryce, who praised Parnell and Davitt for rendering a great service to England in bringing about a better feeling between the two countries. He was not surprised, he said, that Davitt early in the period of agitation desired absolute independence for Ireland. Sir Charles Russell said he could not regard the commission judges as men free from prepossessions and prejudices, nor as men who ought to have been asked to deal with the many questions referred to them. (Hear, hear.) He was justified in speaking thus, for the judges themselves had confessed they had not found within the mandate given them by Parliament a direction to report upon that part of the subject without which it was impossible for anyone to judge of the moral character of acts imputed to certain members. A bad precedent had been made in the selection of three judges to decide questions having chiefly a political aspect. He had the greatest respect for the opinion of the judges on questions that were capable of direct dispute, but not when they began to draw inferences. The whole case was vitiated by political bias. It was conducted with pertinacious rancor by the Attorney-General, in a manner in which it would not have been conducted if the political character of the commission had not swayed away his judgment. (Opposition cheers.) After commenting on a part of the evidence as leaving the origin of the conspiracy against Parnell still obscure, the speaker urged both sides to abandon discussing the great Irish question, on the ground of the personal character of the men who were for or against home rule. Were there no men on the Government side, he asked, magnanimous enough or statesmen enough to lift the question beyond the lower region of personalities into the proper plane of natural justice and national principle? (Cheers.) Sir E. Webster, the Attorney-General, said he thought Mr. Charles ought to have acted himself upon his advice to avoid giving the debate a personal character. But the debate and the case before the commission had teemed with personalities. He had been represented throughout by the speakers of the Opposition as the villain of the piece, although only doing his duty as counsel. It had even been suggested that he ought to apologize for certain remarks about the Parnellites. Yet the Parnellites had allowed themselves the greatest license in personal criticism. As an instance, he mentioned Sir Charles Russell's calling Le Caron a living lie, although the commission declared it believed Le Caron against the oath of Parnell. (""Oh, Oh,"" and cheers.) Proceeding to comment upon the fate of the leaguers withholding their documents, he called the House to recollect that leaguers who were invincible, such as Egan, Sheridan, and Brennan, could not face the commission. As for the telegrams which Mr. Harrington quoted during the debate, they were sent in order to obtain evidence for the defense in Mr. Parnell's libel action against the Times. Throughout the case no step had been taken on behalf of the Times. The Government had aimed solely to throw the clearest possible light upon the doings of the leaguers. Truth, not misrepresentation, had been their aim. It was concluded that the findings of the commission ought to be set at naught; that all that was new was not true, while all that was true was well known. But the commission had shown what respondents denied, that there was an intimate connection between the Clan-na-Gael and the Irish leaguers through the American league, that it had traced the affiliation of the two with the existence of the league, and it had provided impartial minds with evidence that justified the bulk of the accusations against the Parnellites."

"18900329","K. Mount, who made a searching examination of the body, after which it was prepared for burial by the coroner's orders. An inquest was subsequently held at which Dr. Mount testified to the cause of her death. There could be no doubt of the deceased lady's identity, for her underclothing was all marked with the name ""M. Jack."" There was no money in her pockets, but the only piece of jewelry she was ever known to wear - a plain old locket - was still on her person. There was no evidence of foul play, and the abrasions on the temple and breast were the result of contact with the ice and of decomposition. The body had been apparently in the water for about three months. He attributed her death to asphyxia, caused by submersion in the water. Rev. Canon Henderson identified the body. He had made Miss Jack's acquaintance about a fortnight before she was lost. She was then on a visit with Miss Hivitie at the Windsor Hotel. There was nothing in her manner to indicate that she was of unsound mind; on the contrary, she appeared unusually strong in mind and body. She was in comfortable circumstances. He last saw her alive between 10 and 11 a.m. on the 4th of January, in his own house. He heard her frequently say that she was fond of long walks. The day before she had gone over the mountain accompanied by his youngest daughter, and on another day had walked as far as the Lower Lachino road. He was not aware that it was her custom to carry money with her. After the coroner had summed up the evidence, the jury returned a verdict: ""That the said Miss Jack was found drowned in the waters of the Lachino canal, and that no traces of violence were found on her body."" The unfortunate lady disappeared on the 4th of January last, and the most diligent search had failed to find any clue of her until her body was found as stated. The last that was seen of her alive was when she went to call on Mrs. Henderson. She had afterwards gone for a walk and never returned. It was surmised that she had been overtaken by a snowstorm on the mountain and had perished there. Detective Carpenter was given the case, but could find no clue of her whereabouts or what had happened to her. The mountain was scoured from base to pinnacle by the searchers of the city, but without any success. The deceased lady was a native of Montrose, Scotland, but was formerly a resident of Dumfries, and at one time was actively connected with the McAll mission at Paris. She was known and respected by a large circle of friends, not only in the places named, but in Montreal. Many of those visited the morgue yesterday, and the scene was very affecting. Her funeral will take place today. COURT QUEEN'S BENCH. Acquitted of Abetting an Assault - An Adjournment to Monday. Patrick Donnelly, carter, charged with aiding and abetting his brother, M."

A severe snowstorm was experienced in the Gulf and outside Belle Isle, dense fog caused several hours of detention. The steamer was nearly lost near Crane Island through a mistake of the pilot, who, Captain Cross says, was utterly ignorant of where he was taking her. He forced the Dominion over Crane Island spit, passing through shoal waters. Had the water not been at high mark the steamer, Captain Cross says, would have been wrecked on the rocks. As it was he had to anchor and lie for eight hours in the shallow water until the tide rose before he could get off.

The Water Warfare, In the water tax case of Lsplins v. the City, Mr. Barnard, Q.C., continued his argument before Mr. Justice Wurtele yesterday morning, holding that the collection of water tax was illegal as the accounts were not made out from the assessment roll but from blotter, the general assessment roll not then being ready. Mr. Roy responded, reviewing the manner of collecting the water tax since 1850, and showing the changes made in the by-law. He also contended that Mr. Lepine's action was premature, as he had not waited to see if the city would turn off the water or not. Mr. Doherty followed for the plaintiff, claiming that Mr. Roy's remarks were irrelevant and contending that the water rate had to be based on the assessment roll as well as all other taxes. The court took the case under advisement. The attorney then asked that Mr. Lafontaine's case be postponed until judgment was rendered in the Lewine case, but His Honor refused to allow it, and Mr. Barnard thereupon filed a dissenting statement. Mr. Etbler asked that the case be dismissed with costs, and this was granted.

This is all the more pressing as the association is beginning to become popular, and every day more teams in the various sections of this city are forming. There are at present three union clubs, and the number is anticipated to be augmented by next spring. There is no reason why Montreal should not have as many association teams as Rugby; the more there are, the better it is for all interests. The severity of the weather was a deterrent to the players, who kept on jackets and soft hats, and in some instances wore gloves. They needed them to keep blood in circulation, as the game was anything but a fast one. If the club continues, it will be a regular conglomeration of colors. Each team wore the same colors, with one who wore a bright summer hat. It was not by any means a brilliant match between two third-class teams. The players swayed, the most noticeable being Jacoby, the form of all, since he knows the game and passes little when challenged. Forrester, with deftness, speed, and experience, will prove a strong asset. LeBlie will be the best of the four. He kicks cautiously and feeds firmly. Lax has speed, but McCarthy and Unroe are safe. HUNT. Saturday's run at St. Michel Corners. On Saturday, the Hunt met at St. Michel Corners, but the day was not altogether what the followers of the chase look forward to. That proverbial old saying about cloudy skies was right at home, but the southerly wind did not materialize to any great extent; the atmosphere was too cold, the ground was frosty, and altogether it was bad for scenting. It was not an enjoyable day for the sport, and none but the most enthusiastic fox hunters would turn out under such circumstances; but there are lots of enthusiasts still left in the Montreal Hunt, and they always manage to enjoy themselves and have some sort of a run anyway. A move was made along the St. Leonard road for about three miles, and then the hounds were thrown into the covers just above the seven-mile stone. These were drawn blank, as well as all the covers as far as Bjut da 1 lie. About two o'clock, just as the hounds were about to be drawn off, a fox was found in a small cedar cover about two miles from the end of the Island. He broke at first in a southwesterly direction, running towards Point aux Trembles. After going for about half a mile, he doubled, ran east for a mile and a half, and went to ground under a large barn, where it was impossible to unearth him, and this notwithstanding that a good hour was spent trying to dig him out. It was getting pretty late, and as the days are growing shorter and an incipient snowstorm was giving manifestations of its approach, Nichols was ordered to go home. There was a find and no kill, but still the ride was long enough to satisfy anybody, and there were enough still timbers to make it interesting for the most reckless. Among those mounted were noticed Miss Maggie Allan on Coquette, Miss Edith Allan on Glencoe, Mrs. Andrew Bell on Iron Duke, and John Crawford."
"18901118","The friends of the work will go in a body to St. Thomas' Church. The Hansa line steamship Kehrwieder, Captain Brackert, arrived in port yesterday after a voyage of twenty-one days. She left Hamburg on the morning of October 23, and after passing the north of Scotland, bad weather and a severe snowstorm were encountered. For sixteen days, until she lighted Belle Isle, a succession of gales and hurricanes were experienced, during which parts of the rail on the starboard side and a portion of the bridge were carried away by the waves, by which she was at times completely submerged.

"18901129","KOVEMBER 29, 1890 13 GAY PARIS AND NEW YORK What Women Wear in Circles of High Fashion Braila And Hunt-The Newest Styling In Fleece And Their Market Trimmed It is a warm winter, perhaps, the newest feature of this winter's wrapping. In Jacket it is seen with fur and sometimes has fur even. The mink sleeves face H. They are pretty and comfortable-looking, albeit somewhat clumsy. A broadcloth jacket laced with silk-colored film, worn with a fur which a latter semi-circle smile told was 'silver lot,' are likely to prove attractive. They are double-breasted, with a plain front and fitted backs in the reefer style. Black broadcloth trimmed in gold braid is striking. A fine coat, with yellow embroidery and yellow silk revers, certainly attracts the eye, and will no doubt secure its due measure of appreciation in dollars and cents. A heavy snowstorm wool is bound with black braid and given chinchilla collar and cuffs. A pink-tufted gray tweed is made up with gray velvet notched collar, or either the velvet is put on in a round collar, and the jacket front turned black at the upper corner to complete the notch. This jacket is inexpensive and remarkably pretty. A lovely quality of chinchilla is run down the fronts of a black diagonal jacket in a wide facing that rolls back in full-length revers, a style which leads to other fur-trimmed jackets. Another black diagonal has vest and revers of tan-colored cord passementerie. The brocade velvet jacket with ostrich-feather trimmings are valued at $55 and $75. These are cut quite short, as are some of the French dress jackets, but, as a rule, the style of a market jacket reaches its length, until the front of the so-called jacket are coats in truth. Comparatively few jackets are now cut in one piece, the attached skirt in a varied idea being the present jacket fad. On a well-turned figure it is extremely neat. The skirt may be sewed on straight across the hip all around, or the jacket proper may run to the bottom in front or back, or both, leaving skirt pieces to be set in between. The latter style, particularly if the back piece be left free from the side, presents the effect of a coat tail. Often the portion of the jacket running down the skirt in front is a mere point; that is, a tally sewed fast to the side piece, and sometimes with odd remit. The military jacket is on the parade still, and has as many admirers as ever, apparently. Jackets with long skirts split to the hip several times on the separate piece edged with fur or feathers and braided with tinsel or silk are showy. Others have the skirt deeply battlemented with a battlemented yoke, giving a corset appearance to the part which clasps the waist. The tight-fitting jackets are very tight-fitting indeed and are intended for the corset, catering to the elastic figure, the form feminine rather than the form divine. In these tight-fitting jackets some are given the straight diagonal double-breast from the turn of the bust to the waist, leaving a V above, which is finished with or without collar, and allowing the skirts below to set apart. When these jackets are closed all the way up it is with single breast usually, elaborate cord or passementerie frog or ornamental button relieving the front. Buttons, large and small, and handsome frogs are more used than for some time. Many of the buttons are worthy of their character as ornament, though others are more conspicuous than artistic. Vest jackets are furnished with a double row of small buttons. Rubber buttons, little and big, are again in use, though less for jackets than for the long camel's-hair coat. Far-front jackets have the button-and-frog fever allayed by two or three frogs crossing the front at the bottom of the skirt. Buttons are placed on the lower part of the sleeves, as in dresses; the lower sleeve may be split to the elbow and given an insertion of velvet or other trimming, with buttons on one side and simulated buttonhole on the other, perhaps with cord lacing. The sleeves are large and are very high. They have deep pointed caps at the top or the smooth military roll, or any arrangement that the fancy of the designer may conceive. When the garment is fur trimmed the fur cuffs often are extraordinarily large, the Russian style being sought with success in jackets, coats, and mantles. Again, a close cuff of cloth forms the lower part of the sleeve, which is separated from the full upper sleeve by a band of fur at the elbow. Large gauntlet cuffs are of the jacket good, heavily trimmed, or perhaps of velvet. Braided sleeves, passementerie and velvet sleeves, are seen in every variety, but sleeves like the garment, handsomely trimmed in consonance with it, are in the truest taste. Trimmings are literally too numerous to mention. Those used on jackets are repeated on every line of wraps. Feathers are the newest rage here, as elsewhere, and are employed in all colors and several kinds, though the ostrich feathers are first, of course. The jewel passementerie combined with feathers or fur, or alone, is always rich. Fur and feathers are appliqued on and trimmed with gold and set with jewels in veining and outlining. Strings of ball passementerie are hung over wraps, and fringes of this style are largely used. Chenille fringe of all lengths, from an inch to two feet, is one of the most beautiful garnitures. Passementerie is run upon the seam of jackets and other wraps, sometimes accenting the seam for only a part of its length, again extending from shoulder to skirt button. Broad braid is put on in the same way. Cord and passementerie and tinsel girdles are used, being fastened to the wrap possibly around the neck, or for a short distance down the back or front, then allowed to swing free the entire length of the garment. Hoods and hats are prepared to match the wrap and its trimming. Lace applique and net run with jet and jewels, silver and gold braid, and chain stitching in patterns done in heavy embroidery silk are other ideas used by themselves, or intertwined as to be beyond analysis. Persian colors add gayety to the general gracefulness, and are applied to materials which never knew them before, notably to thick leaf plush and to black velvet. Beautiful dress jackets are offered of colored velvets with embroidery in silk of their own colors, illuminated with tinsel. Lace is set on in shoulder capes and neck rushes, and even in flounces around the bottom. One style of fancy jacket shows a cape of lace put on with a standing ruffle around the line of the shoulders, and a full, high lace ruche. Girdles or belts encircle the waist and are laced in front. These are richly wrought with embroidery matching that upon other parts of the jacket. In long wraps the girdles are generally pointed and merely hold fronts plaited. Pockets are set in straight or curved slits, bound or stitched on the edge, or are inserted obliquely. Pocket flaps are in favor, both on wraps and gowns. Double flaps are more frequent than single ones; pockets, also, are small ones directly over a 'saddle,' each with narrow piping on jackets, and the oblique pockets have narrow and usually irregularly scalloped flaps. The oblique pockets are a favorite with the girl who likes to look smart; that most abominable of English terms and conditions, by using it for a hand rest she secures for the arm that angular, akimbo position which delights her, for with it she is armed for conquest. Those who admire the smart girl admire her with an eye. It is a fashion that is very American, but decidedly un-English. A noticeable characteristic of this season is the lining of the wraps. As an individual opinion is said now to be the last resort of a garment, Hall satin seems to be the chosen lining for all styles of cloaks not lined with fur. The color of the lining may be the same as that of the outer material, though differing in shade, but it is as often fitted in colors entirely contrasting with the wrap which it lines. Wadded and quilted satin lining gives warmth without much added weight to many cloaks. The most worn wrap is for indoor and outdoor, for morning, for the day, for the evening, and I am not quite confident that the surah night-cloaks have not an edge of teal to become the throat and bend. The great chic is the Redfern pelisse, a circular, to be clear, of scarlet cloth, the fullness gathering into a sealskin yoke, and this, falling down clear to the feet in front, narrowing of course, and hanging free from the mantle and lined with shellina pattern. If you can afford still more simplicity with still more expense, choose the olive-green cloth pelisse lined with blue fox. For the Empress of Russia, Redfern has just made a violet velvet emery, lined with blue, with passementerie trimming inside of violet and gold. I almost forgot to say that all the Bijou toilets are signed by some, and the one of Cronset by Blanche L. T. Lonvler, who used to make the rain and the sunlight of Laferriere when that house gave the fashion. Ludinard has given the Jabot quirk in fancy moft. For, be it known, one does not have one or two of these nowadays, but a collection of a dozen or more, like capotes and round hats. One is made of dark French velvet, spangled in gold, with a daring cluster of green plumes thrust in a queer knot of tea rose satin. This muff, Ludinard calls the 'Kitrontce.' No. 2 she styles 'Chagrin,' and it is made of heliotrope satin, studded with large jet nails like a battlement, and with flots of Chantilly at each side and a falling cluster of Parma violets, so that everyone dashes forward to pick it up, and looks savage to find it securely pinned on with a jewel bug. For the plain seal muff, Ludinard has instituted a black moire ribbon with some curious motto embroidered thereon, and 61 ally on the side. The skin muff is a cluster velvet knot in which you thrust each day a natural flower to suit caprice or intent. This last muff the creator styles 'Flirtation,' because it can be made to do a good deal of work in that line quite equal to the fashion of the chamois. I have said nothing of hats and bonnets this season, and must of necessity abridge facts and only take a few of the many good things shown by Vma, Michlewice-Tuvee. The Ninon toque capote are not much used, in their place come these toques worn with narrow velvet one-inch strings. It is made of the new blue shade of velvet. It is a bright tint, called turquoise, but not a bit like the stone, or like anything else that I can imagine. Around the edge of the Ninon toque is a band of gold passementerie set with topaz. The velvet is chiffon over the open crown; this is the most way of making, I find, and it secures regular rest and lightness. The Lepolx capote named thus in honor of the pretty actress of the Gymnase is entirely made of the dark-green, brown, black, and gold gonracoa feathers, with trimmings of rose velvet. The Herri ebon capote, and a real one, is made of rose de chine cloth drawn over the crown with a queer artistic twist; under the edge, all around, are folds of black tulle dotted with jet; this makes a knot and two loops in front, held by a cut jet ring. Three small black tips behind stick up in the air. Black velvet strings are used. The Sue dels toque is the great Tavee bit of the season. It is usually made thus far of scarlet or of pale blue velvet. All in front and around the edge is a diadem band of black ostrich, finely curled like astrakhan. The color of the red velvet is called 'vendange' velvet. It is supposed to be the shade of the juice coming from the fresh pressed grape. This velvet is curiously twisted to form a series of organ tubes over the plume in front and in the fold behind nestles a small tuft of black plume. The Romanian toque is made of rose de nine velvet, with a wide embroidery a la hommit around the edge; there is a velvet bird in front and gold ribbon string. I cannot find the latter either pretty or decorous. They are stiff to tie and are apt to fret the skin. The Cleopatra capote again, a true one, has an edge of blue velvet over narrow gold lace, with a crown of embroidered gold tulle set in amethyst, pearls, black and white, three black plumes behind, above the pale blue velvet strings. The Coquille toque is charming and novel for an entire black hat. A jet open work shell pattern coronet surrounds the toque, and it is so delicately mounted that it is not at all heavy. The fond or crown is of gold cloth studded with gilt beads. The usual black aigrette behind not plumes immount the gold string. A HUB Coalrimillew To the Editor of the Gazette: Dear Sir, There is an old adage that says ""a prophet is not without honor save in his own country,"" and the saying is generally accepted as containing much truth; indeed it is expanded into the generally accepted belief that true merit, whether it be that of an individual, or that of some medicinal preparation, is much more likely to meet with popular approval at a distance than at home. Nasal Balm, acknowledged as being the greatest remedy for cold in the head and catarrh, ever offered the people of Canada, affords a striking instance of the fact that popular opinion, for once, at least, is wrong. From the outset its popularity in the home of its manufacture has been unbounded and constantly increasing. In evidence of this we offer testimonials from two Brockville gentlemen who are known throughout the Dominion."
"18901203","I, December 1 A terrible snowstorm visited this province yesterday. The wind blew 40 miles an hour and in many places there are snowdrifts from two to four feet in height. The tide last evening was the highest known here for years and all the wharves were flooded and the lower part of the warehouses thereon. Much damage resulted. Breastworks were carried away and the cellars near the wharf were full of water. Damage by the storm throughout the country is reported as follows: Two railroad bridges wrecked, railroad breastwork damaged and trains delayed; some of the principal shipping ports are closed, and thousands of bushels of potatoes and many vessels will be obliged to remain here all winter. The Island boat started for Pictou and after getting as far as Canso, was obliged to return. She was seventeen hours getting back to port. She had a terrible passage. The thermometer registered 3 degrees below zero. A stable owned by a Mrs. Tremaine, situated in the center of a wooden block, was set on fire during the height of the storm. Two buildings were burned with their contents and two horses also perished. The firebug was not arrested. There is hardly any insurance. The weather has moderated but is still very cold and everything looks wintery. Halifax, December 2 Reports of losses by Scatlcley's storm continue to arrive from various parts of the coast. The schooner Jeffrey Franklin, with a general cargo, was driven ashore on Meagher's beach, at the entrance to Halifax harbor. Her cargo will be saved, but the vessel owned by Murdock McLeod, St. Anns, C.B., is badly damaged; she is insured. A telegram from Whitehead announces the total wreck of the schooner Numbesem, from Sydney for Halifax, with a cargo of coal. The Sunbeam is owned by George Livingstone, of Port L'Isle, C.B., and is insured. At Canso three schooners and eight fishing boats were driven ashore. Three of them are total wrecks and the others are more or less damaged. The vessels ashore are the James Liven, Lida and Lizzie, Hector McKinnon. The Ryan got off with but little damage; the Hector with her top damaged by collision with the Lida and Lizzie. The Lida and Lizzie, laden with dry fish, from D'Escousse for Halifax, is still ashore leaking badly. The Enxine, produce laden, from Prince Edward Island for Halifax, is yet aground and leaking freely. Information has been received at Liverpool by cable from Jamaica announcing the total loss of the schooner On Time, Captain J.K. Kempton, owned by John H. Harlow and others, of that place. She was on her way to Colon to Halifax loaded with old iron. Her crew were saved. The American schooner Alice is ashore at L'Isle aux Coudres. The crew were saved. The following vessels are ashore on the Hunkestury side of the Strait of Canso: Ottawa, Granada, Leila Linwood, Admiration and Helen McCrosby. The Arizona and the brigantines Bessie Louise and Mattie Louise dragged anchors, collided and were damaged. The mails did not cross the straits of Canso today owing to the storm. The schooner Mary Euphrosyne, from Halifax, for Magdalen Islands, with a general cargo is ashore at Port Hawkesbury. The cargo is insured here. Every hour brings fresh reports of wrecks caused by the storm, which seems to have been most destructive on the Cape Breton coast. The schooners Bella May and Kexon are ashore at Gabarus. The Isabella, Captain Ferguson, parted her chains at Arichat and was driven ashore. The Native Lut, Captain McLeod, is ashore at Olawow harbor, Canso, and the Maggie Millard is ashore and full of water at Gabarus. The foregoing are all from Halifax bound to Cape Breton ports. The schooner Virgesco is also reported ashore at Lower Desbarats, C."
"18901204","MANY TALES OF WRECKS, Frew rap Pablo to Newfoundland - (New Leaf In the Bay of Fundy - An Ice-Hound Fleet) (From our own correspondent) Sr John, December 8 The recent cold snap, during which the mercury got down to 10 degrees below zero, is followed by a heavy snowstorm, and unless rain lets in there will be fine sleighing tomorrow. Word comes from Moncton that several schooners are likely to be frozen in on Petitcodiac River. A Newfoundland schooner is frozen in at Point de Chene. A terrific northwest gale and high tide at Cape Torment yesterday swept the breakwater and cleared off everything moveable except the hoisting engine. Lumber and car rail and ties, tools, etc., were swept off, and the contractor's loss must be heavy. Three lobster factories, owned respectively by Job Allen, Whailea and Millige Trenholm, were wrecked. Job Allen's loss is fully one thousand dollars, Trenholm's five hundred and Whailea's one hundred. The dykes were swept and one hundred tons of hay destroyed. This, with the short crop, will be a severe blow to the farmers there. All Hands on Board Lost Intelligence was received tonight of a fearful disaster in the Bay of Fundy off Harbourville, Cornwallis, a topmast schooner being capsized and going down with all hands. The disaster occurred at one o'clock Monday afternoon, two miles distant from the shore, being witnessed by parties on the land who, in the heavy storm, were unable to tender assistance. The vessel sank ten minutes after turning over. She was running on a lee shore before a northerly gale, carrying a two reefed mainsail, the whole foresail and jib. The identity of the schooner is unknown, but wreckage began to wash ashore two hours after the disaster. This consisted of chain boxes, painted yellow; broken dories, painted the same color; cabin doors, the galley and the box cover for patent steering gear. She had two jibs and looked like an American fishing schooner, an impression that seems to be borne out by the wreckage cast ashore. There is no name on any of the wreckage. If the unfortunate vessel was a fishing schooner she no doubt had a large crew. Those who witnessed the disaster think the vessel was making for Parrsboro. Prince Edward Island Frozen In Charlotte Town, P"
"18901205","Y was cut about the head and badly hurt. James E. Clark, leather dealer, of Button, was also badly bruised. The wounded will doubtless recover with the possible exception of Knight. The wreck occurred at the crossing of the Wabash and Chicago & Alton roads. The Chicago & Alton train was standing at the depot on the crossing when the whistle of the Wabash train was heard. The engineer darted his train and had got all across but the rear sleeper when the Wabash engine crashed into it, cutting it in two, and ploughing its way for some rods, finally burying itself in the ground. There were eight persons in the sleeper. Terrible Blast Furnace Accident, Joliet, IL, December 4. At the blast furnace department of the Illinois Iron and Steel Company's works today the furnace, which was blown out for repairs made necessary by a recent fatal explosion, fell to the ground without warning. Eleven men were at work inside at the battens and about six on top. Masonry work and furnace lining were piled up in a confused heap mingled with dead and dying workmen. A band of laborers at once began the work of rescue. Gathered around them and urging them were waiting wives and children. Within a half hour they took out eight bodies. Five of the unfortunates were dead, crushed almost out of all semblance of human shape, while the other three were apparently fatally injured. The killed were: Gus Loose, Nel Larson, John Pederson, Theodore Larson, Stala French. Fatally Injured: Fat Kilien, Peter Erickson, August Swanson. One man was buried in the water tank and another cut in two. One of the men on top of the furnace escaped serious injury. Distressed Nebraska Farmers, Omaha, December 4. The commission appointed by Governor Thayer to devise means for relieving the suffering due to the shortage of crops in Nebraska has submitted a report showing an almost total failure of crops in twelve counties, and that 10,000 families are in need of assistance. The Governor did make appeals to other states lest it jeopardize the credit of the state, but promises relief when the Legislature meets. A Kansas Town Burning Up, Salina, Kansas, December 4. Reports from Brookfield, this county, say nearly the whole town is ablaze. The fire started early this afternoon and one business block and the Central Hotel are nearly consumed. The town has about 400 inhabitants and there is no way to extinguish the fire except by bucket. A strong wind is blowing. No estimate of the loss can be obtained. Its Pending in the Court of Claims, Washington, December 4. The annual report of Attorney-General Miller states the number of suits pending in the Court of Claims is about 14,000, without regarding the great number of suits involving millions in special jurisdictions and the French spoliation claims. The war claims alone now pending number about 8,000 and will aggregate $100,000,000. The B.W. & O's Threatened Rival, Watertown, NY, December 4. A special from New York states that Walter Webb, of the New York Central, is positive a new road will be built to Watertown and the St. Lawrence River. President Depew admits that it is being seriously considered and Austin Corbin says he will work with the Central people to open the new line. Must Pay Duty on The Angelus, Washington, December 4. Assistant Secretary Spaulding, of the Treasury Department, has rendered a decision holding that the bonafide owners of the famous painting ""The Angelus"" are liable for $10,000 duty on the painting. Heavy Snow in Vermont, Lyndonville, VT, December 4. Fifteen inches of snow fell last night. Railway traffic is somewhat impeded. The lumbermen will commence operations at once and large business is expected. Bear Disguised Robbery, Kansas City, December 4. Ten thousand dollars' worth of diamonds, the property of Mr. Kirk B. Armour, have been stolen from the vault of a safe deposit company here. Defunct Manufacturers Fail, New York, December 4. Julius Bonn & Butler, manufacturers of ruffling, have failed. Liabilities $40,000. New Brunswick News, St. John, December 4. The sensational Nicholson-Grant case came up in the Equity Court today and was further postponed. Witnesses are wanted from Australia. Last night's snowstorm turned to rain and swept the streets bare. A terrific wind raged all day with frequent squalls. The weather is colder tonight. The two British farmer delegates who passed through St. John yesterday spent today in Fredericton visiting the Normal School, Parliament building, the industries, stores, etc., and also went to Gibson's cotton mill at Marysville, which Major Stevenson declared was the finest he had seen in Canada and did not recollect seeing a finer one on the other side. The delegates go with Premier Blair and Secretary Lugrin to Woodstock and other points, returning to St. John about Monday next. PARTLY CLOUDY AND COLD Weather Predicted for Today, With Light Snow in Some Places, Toronto, December 4, 11 p.m. The disturbance which was in the North Pacific States last night is now central over Colorado and the other important disturbance has since swept over the Maritime provinces attended by a severe gale, together with heavy snow and rain. Heavy snow has also fallen along the St. Lawrence Valley. Minimum temperature Calgary, 12; Qu'Appelle, 4 below zero; Winnipeg, 2; Toronto, 12; Montreal, 10; Quebec, 2; Halifax, 12.

"18901218","In the case of the United States there had been an actual decline, while in the case of Great Britain there had been a very large increase. In the face of such a fact how could it be said that the United States was the better market? If the important class of animals and their products were taken the result would be even more strikingly in favor of Great Britain. The figures were: To United To Germany, to Great Britain. Here again there had been a decline on one side and great gain on the other; in fact, the relative positions of these countries had been reversed so far as the purchase of Canadian farm products was concerned. In respect also of the total exports of Canada for the year ending 10th June last, they showed a falling off to the United States of $1,000,000 and an increase of $10,000,000 to Great Britain as compared with 1890. Mr. Carling then showed the great extent of the demand for farm products in Great Britain and how small a percentage was met by Canada. In that market our farmers met with the keenest rivalry from the Americans, the very men who were being held up as their best customers. There was great room for a large increase of our exports to Great Britain, and there were good reasons for expecting that large increases would take place within the next few years. In dealing with the question of the burden arising from the public debt, Mr. Carling brought out the important fact that the net interest had declined in 1890 by cents per head of the population; to that whereas the per capita interest was $1 in 1878, it was now $1.05 in 1890. For this additional seven cents the Canadian Pacific Railway had been built, the canals deepened, and many great public works carried out. The Minister of Agriculture then showed that for all the farmers had to sell how he got good prices as in 1878, while for what he bought he paid on an average 15 percent less. In other words, for 75 cents he could now buy at mill what he bought for $1 in 1878. In conclusion, he urged the farmers of Canada to study the facts in relation to their position, to refuse to discriminate against their best customers, and in all respects to hold their own. His speech was listened to with deep attention and was frequently applauded. Then, Louis Beaubien followed in an interesting speech on the advantages of ensilage and the best methods of growing corn for that purpose. He was both witty and instructive. In the evening the chief speaker was Prof. J. S. Anderson, who gave a most interesting account of the work being carried on at the Experimental Farm, together with some of the important results arrived at. His speech was marked by accuracy of detail and a thorough grasp of the subject in hand. Mr. Chapels, the assistant dairy commissioner, and Mr. H. S. Foster also gave interesting addresses, the former speaking in French. While in Cochrane, the party were the guests of Mr. Louis Fore, M.P., at whose residence they were given a dinner. A number of representative gentlemen of the county were present. Hon. Mr. Carling also made a careful inspection of Mr. Pope's livestock in the forenoon and expressed great admiration for the splendid thoroughbred herds which are stabled at Fastview. To-day, the same speakers who were here are addressing a large meeting of farmers at Ayer's Flats. To Explore the Interior of Alaska Washington, December 17. A bill providing for a systematic exploration of the interior of Alaska is likely to be considered by Congress during the coming week. It provides that the Secretary of War shall send out a party of explorers composed of army officers, soldiers, and others, and appropriates $100,000 for expenses. The report accompanying the bill says Alaska is nearly 600,000 square miles in area and, excepting along the coast, is almost unknown. It is proposed that the exploring party shall remain for three years in the territory. The expedition will be the first systematic attempt made by the Government to explore Alaska. The Secretary of War approved the bill in his annual report. Terrific Storm and Rainfall in New York and Pennsylvania. New York, December 17.

Archbishop O'Brien Joins in the Condemnation of Parnell, and says it is impossible for the Irish people ever again to follow his lead. The suggestion that he marry Mrs. O'Shea and reappear as a leader would not mend matters. The Catholic Church, he says, is unalterably opposed to the marriage of divorced persons, and neither the hierarchy nor any self-respecting Catholic woman could ever receive or speak to Mrs. Parnell. Cycle engineer Jasper Hancock died last night under disgusting circumstances. He procured a bottle of Halifax whisky, became very drunk, lay down on his back, vomited, was too helpless to turn over on his side, and the vomit ran back through his windpipe and bronchial tubes down into his lungs and suffocated him. The liquor must have been the vilest poison. He only drank half the contents of the bottle. An inquest was held and the usual stereotyped verdict returned. No attempt was made to analyze the liquor. Hancock was only 21 years of age and one of the best athletes in the camp. The schooner Otter, of Lunenburg, eighty tons register, now in port, has been purchased by Mr. Bunt, a fur merchant of Victoria, B.C., who is now here, and is fitting out for her long voyage. She will take a crew of ten men from here and will be commanded by Capt. John Reilly, of Victoria, who is here looking after the fitting up of the vessel. Capt. Reilly is one of the pioneer sailors of the Pacific, having been engaged in the business for over nine years. He is a native of Glasgow, Scotland. During the time he has been seal hunting he has met with many adventures with the United States cruiser, having been imprisoned at one time and fined $1,500. The money, however, was not exacted and after spending seven weeks of a six-month's sentence in jail at Sitka he was released by order of the President. At another time he had the pleasure of the company of two United States officers on his vessel from the sealing grounds to Victoria, they having come on board and declined to leave when requested.

END OF REMI LAMONTAGNE Another Terrible Crime Exploded on the Scaffold, IIB W KTB DEATH CALMLY, It is the execution preceded by the sudden death of Sheriff Weak. From our own correspondent, Biiimmcoai, December 19 This morning, at 9:26, the fatal bolt was drawn and Remi Lamontagne, who has excited so much attention for the past two years, was ushered into eternity. The crime for which he suffered is familiar to all our readers and the names of Leda and Remi Lamontagne have become household words throughout the province. Suffice it to say that two years ago last July Napoleon Michel, of St. Ferdinand de Woffelown, was brutally murdered in his own house, his throat cut and gashed in many places, his body placed upon a bed and covered with a mattress which was set on fire. Michel was roused to consciousness by the flames, escaped from the burning building, crawled to a neighbor, where he lived some days and made an ante-mortem deposition accusing Remi Lamontagne, his brother-in-law, and Leda, his wife. Remi escaped to the woods where he continued in hiding for some months, but was finally brought in by his brother-in-law who received the reward offered for his arrest. In the meantime, Leda had been tried for the murder and acquitted, and had left for the States. She was the principal witness, but could not be found, and Remi was remanded from term to term until this summer, when Leda was arrested in Boston, and, after lengthy legal struggles, was extradited to stand her trial on a charge of arson. The sensational feature of the trial, her refusal to testify and her sentence to a year's imprisonment for contempt of court are fresh in everyone's mind. The countless Ban's atSKtMo, Remi was sentenced to be hanged on the 19th day of December, which this morning was carried into effect. Lamontagne was visibly affected last week by Blanchard's execution and the anxious words which the latter addressed to him regarding his spiritual state, to which, until that time, he had paid very little attention. However, a change seemed to come over him; he went into retreat, and under the ministrations of Rev. Father Tallier, his spiritual adviser, he received the comforts of the church, and died in the earnest hope that his sins were forgiven. Last evening Mr. Lemieux telegraphed Mr. Panet that ""the writ of error in Remi Lamontagne's case was refused."" He did not seem at all downcast when he heard this message, but when Rev. Fathers Roy and Castagna met him at 10 o'clock he rallied and said, ""I have the last and great news for me; I was expecting it, and am not surprised at it; I am satisfied. If I have to die I would rather die now than two months later."" The Rev. Father chatted with him and cheered him and many times his laughter rang out. He got some repose, and this morning seemed strong and cheerful. Father Tallier and Roy celebrated Mass in his cell, and although he was told to kneel he spent nearly the whole time of the service on his knees, he seemed perfectly resigned and ready to go. The morning was cold and clear, and the sun shone brightly in the blue heavens which were not marred by a single cloud. A lovely morning for everyone, but how inexplicably lovely to him who knew it was the last time he would ever see the glory of nature, that key to the dark stream of death. It was a morning one could not associate with the accumulation of benefits it brought. The execution was expected to take place at nine, and at half past eight Sheriff Wash, who had made a hearty breakfast at the M. ggc house with Mr. U H Aylmer Brooke, of Richmond, chatted with the latter gentleman and walked to the jail. Before starting Mr. Brooke asked him if he would not drive, but he said he preferred walking. On the way up he spoke of how thankful he would be when the execution was over and complained of one of his legs troubling him in walking, but was apparently as well as usual. When they reached the jail Mr. Read, the jailer, took them into his private parlor. Mr. Webb unbuttoned his overcoat and sat down in an easy chair beside an open fireplace. He then remarked how much more comfortable it was there than in the office, which was crowded with people. At that moment he began to breathe heavily and Mr. Brooke called to him, but getting no answer immediately summoned Drs. Austin and Worthington who were in the building at the time and at one pronounced life extinct. The excitement created a terrible commotion and the execution was delayed a few minutes; but at 9:24 Deputy Sheriff Whitcher, High Constable Mo and Jailer Reed appeared, followed by Rev. Fr. Roy and Tallier, between whom walked with firm step the malefactor prisoner. He wore a neat suit of brown, a turn-down collar and black necktie, and whilst slightly pale looked perfectly calm and walked without an effort; he was followed by Radcliff dressed in a new black broadcloth frock coat. Lamontagne is a magnificent looking specimen of a man and not at all the type of a murderer. When the procession reached the gallows, which was the same used for Blanchard, Lamontagne knelt and made his act of contrition. He then said: ""I am ready to die and meet my God. I thank all for their kindness and hope to meet them beyond."" He next kissed the crucifix and whilst the cap was being adjusted and the rope put around his neck kept repeating ""Holy Jesus have mercy upon."" The Lord's prayer was said and at the words ""Deliver us from evil,"" the drop fell and the body swung into the air. The body quivered and moved convulsively for some minutes, but fourteen minutes after the drop fell Drs. Austin and Worthington pronounced life extinct. Death resulted from strangulation and that one more chapter of this horrible tragedy is finished. Leda, who is completely prostrated, will be tried for arson in March. In his evidence before the coroner's jury, Dr. Austin, the jail physician, declared: ""I have made a post-mortem examination of the said body of Remi Lamontagne, and I find partial dislocation of one of the cervical vertebrae and that death was caused by strangulation."" The verdict was rendered accordingly. A nt, James Three Ftnporlwn, One of the monuments of enterprise in Montreal is J"

In fact, he treated him with such cruelty that Mrs. Lyddon was repeatedly heard by the servants to exclaim: ""Don't hit him in the face, Charley,"" ""For God's sake don't strike him,"" ""He won't anger you again, dear,"" and similar adjurations. When the last hour arrived and the strong constitution of the physician had been completely broken by the powerful drugs ruthlessly administered to him, and his heart had been broken as the hideous fact of his wife's falsehood and his brother's treachery were revealed to him, Charles locked himself in the room with his victim and proceeded to perform the last act in the tragedy. What then occurred is only known to heaven and the occupant of the fatal chamber. It was the finding of an emptied bottle of morphine in an adjacent lumber room that first aroused suspicion and led to the arrest of Charles Lyddon. Then came the story of the horrible details as they were sworn to by different witnesses before the coroner's jury, which was not long in finding a verdict of guilty. Then there was a scene of wild excitement, such as is seldom witnessed in a quiet English provincial town. The crowd that had gathered yesterday around the town hall, standing for hours in a driving snowstorm, soon heard the news of the jury's verdict, and received it with a yell that would have done credit to a chorus recruited from an insane asylum. Soon the culprit appeared at the door surrounded by a guard of twenty policemen. He was first taken to his hotel and afterwards to prison, amid a dense shower of snowballs. The prisoner protests his innocence, and declares that the evidence, which is almost entirely circumstantial, is misleading. He will be tried at the next session. THE RAILWAY WOULD Jay Gould's Policy of Railroad Consolidation. New York, December 24. Mr. Jay Gould's policy of railroad consolidation is being put in operation in the Missouri Pacific system. News from the West yesterday says that a meeting of the directors of five of the local Missouri Pacific companies was held in Atchison, Kan., yesterday and voted to formally consolidate with the parent system. Six other companies of the same system will meet at Wichita today and will be merged in it. A meeting of the directors of another local company is to be held in this city this week and will also consolidate with the Missouri Pacific system, thus making twelve companies that will lose their identity and be swallowed up by the big corporation. There are other local lines that will be consolidated with the system later. The consolidation, it is explained, does not affect the rights of the municipalities that hold stock. There is a widespread belief in the West that the proposed Western association, approved by the recent meeting of the railroad presidents, is an attempt on the part of Mr. Gould to create the biggest traffic combination ever attempted in the history of railroads. It will absorb the four associations now in existence in the West as follows: Number Association of Roads, Western Freight, Trans Missouri."

Indeed I have met with no discontent, but much disappointment. ""Air mail to Atlanta, Florida,"" London, December 2. Sir Charles Tuptor submitted to the Board of Agriculture and other details, proving that considering the extent of the trade, there has been a remarkable immunity from loss of life among Canadian cattle on the way to England. The case of the unfortunate Linda, which sustained such heavy losses, was shown to be quite an exceptional one. Complete statements of the losses on the vessels of the regular line present an excellent record, the percentage of deaths being very small. Public opinion here still strongly supports Mr. Hisplin's new policy of preventing the shipment of cattle by steamers like the Linda. A high official, who is very friendly to the trade, expresses the hope that the Canadian cattle shippers at the inquiry in Montreal will refrain from adopting any course which may be considered hostile to this feeling. The Canadian Government has already assured the committee of the Board of Agriculture of Canada of its desire to cooperate fully in any practical measure to prevent unreasonable heavy losses on cattle ships and the Montreal inquiry would place the trade beyond danger if the cattlemen materially support this view and adopt resolutions regarding the better inspection of both cattle.

"18901227","POISON IN TOILET SOAPS! Attention is directed to this paragraph from The Times newspaper: ""At a recent meeting of the Royal Society of Medicine, Dr. Revel read a paper on the necessity of preventing Chemists and Perfumers from selling dangerous Soaps. To those unaware of the danger, there is in allowing their unchecked sale he said, 'I need but state that arsenic, the red nitrate of mercury, tartar emetic, and potassium antimoniate, form part of their ingredients, whilst they are coloured green by the sesquioxide of chromium, or of a rose colour by the bisulphide of mercury (vermilion). Some contain 30 per cent of insoluble matter, such as lime or plaster, and others contain animal nitrogenous matter, which causes a chronic inflammation of the skin.' The injury to the skin and complexion resulting from the use of these Soaps is seldom attributed to the real cause, so that, unfortunately, the mischief proceeds until too often the beauty of the complexion is ruined, and even the general health impaired. With the fullest confidence the Proprietors of PEARS' SOAP recommend their specialty. They do not claim that it is the only pure Soap, but one of the very few offered to the public. It would be easy to become self-laudatory in this respect, but the following evidence is likely to prove much more convincing. From Professor JOHN ATTFIELD, Professor of Practical Chemistry to the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain; Author of a Manual of General, Medical, and Pharmaceutical Chemistry: 'I have annually, for the past ten years, made an independent analysis of Pears' Soap, and have not found it to vary in quality or in composition. It contains neither excess of alkali nor of moisture, and it is free from artificial colouring matter. A better, purer, or more usefully durable Soap cannot be made.'

"18910101","A special to the front from Louisville, Neb, says: A blinding snowstorm which is fast assuming the proportions of a blizzard began full in here and at the agency at 7 o'clock this morning. Advice says that the desultory fight was kept up nearly all night at the late battle ground within a few miles of the agency until, by reason of the suspicious signs of the alleged friendly Indians in camp near the agency, the troops were called in from the field. It transpired yesterday evening that a large camp of friendly Indians located south of the agency is made up almost entirely of old men, squaws, and children. Nearly every able-bodied Indian had quietly slipped away and joined the hostile forces. That further fighting will occur there seems no doubt. If the Indians should make an onslaught during the storm they would undoubtedly have a great advantage. The delegates say that they will now break away to strongholds in the Bad Lands, which will be reinforced by Rosebud, Standing Rock, and other Indians. Eight more soldiers were brought into the agency last night, bringing the total of yesterday's fatalities. The losses to the Indians are known to have been great, but definite numbers have not yet been ascertained. Two strangers murdered within two miles of the agency yesterday are now believed to be remnants from Louisville. Indian signal lights were again plainly visible last night."

forty-five days, which is wholly without parallel, literally scores of thousands of men, women, and children in the slums of the metropolis are existing today without either food or fire, and almost without clothing All London's vast charitable machinery is strained in every cog and wheel in a vain effort to cope with the distressing situation, which now, of course, grows daily worse Coroner's

been examined, he asked that the responsible editor of the paper be summoned before the jury to explain how such a statement came to be published No action was taken on the request Moise Leclere and Cyrille Kuel, of St Joseph, gave unimportant evidence George Walker testified that he was conductor of the train in question He was on the mail car when the accident occurred He noticed that the car in front had run off the track and jumped on the cord and pulled the cord of the automatic brake He remembered nothing more, for he was unconscious for two or three days after The train was going about twenty or twenty-five miles an hour It was the custom to slacken up and apply the brakes on approaching St Joseph The train was examined at St Thomas and everything found all right It was not the custom when the train was late to ask the engineer to make time, nor had he done so on the day of the accident He could swear positively that the accident had not occurred through running too fast

This proceeding, it says, although terminal, in no way affects the United States Government, while the members of the Supreme Court cannot be otherwise than flattered by this line of the constituents placed in their judgment. Europe, it adds, will look forward with interest to the conclusion of the judicial interlude of wily diplomatic courtesy. The Press, January 17 The statement that the London Mansion House, on behalf of the persecuted Hebrews of Russia, had been returned to the Lord Mayor of London by the Imperial commission on the ground that the commission was not authorized to present such matters to the Czar, is incorrect.

PARNELL IN IRELAND, Dublin, January 18 Mr. Parnell was the principal speaker at a mass meeting held by his agents in Limerick today, where he met with an enthusiastic reception. In the course of his remarks, he said that he was still young enough to fight the battle and that he would continue to distrust the return of the English Whig party. Messrs. Timothy and Edward Harrington and others also addressed the meeting. Mr. Parnell and party were escorted to the station by a procession of torchbearers as they were leaving Cork for Athlone. The fight against landlordism at New Tipperary resulted in a failure. All the stores and stalls in the former business thoroughfare known as O'Brien's arcade, with the exception of three, are either permanently closed or in the hands of the bailiffs, the latter having seized them for debt. In the event of John Dillon being selected as the leader of the Irish party, William O'Brien will return to the United States and resume the work which was interrupted by the recent complications in Irish affairs. Mr. Parnell and Mr. Harrington started for Tralee this afternoon. Before their departure, they addressed a large crowd of sympathizers at the railway station and expressed their thanks for the warmth of the reception accorded to them here. The crowd was very enthusiastic, and the train moved off amid loud cheering. He will Retire Soon, January 18 Mr. Parnell was received here with groans and cheers. Replying to addresses presented to him, he said that he had done his part toward a solution of the Irish problem. The delay in arriving at a settlement was entirely the fault of others. He had made up his own mind on the subject within twenty-four hours after the first interview with O'Brien; he was ignorant as to what action his opponents had decided upon, but if no solution was found, the fault would not be his. In an interview, Mr. Parnell declared that there was not a word of truth in the report that he would retire unconditionally if Gladstone was not satisfied that the Liberal leaders in that case would declare their home rule scheme. Mr. Parnell said if Mr. Gladstone had the courage to make a bill instead of a little home rule bill, he (Parnell) would look forward with confidence to his own retirement, knowing well that Ireland would no longer need his leadership. Mr. Parnell declared that Sir William Vernon Harcourt would succeed Mr. Gladstone as Liberal leader, and that Irish members could not recognize the leadership of such a man unless they were assured that they would get an accepted home rule measure. A Complete Account, Havre, January 18 Messrs. Dillon and O'Brien were in consultation for six hours. At the conclusion of the interview, Mr. Dillon informed the Associated Press correspondent that a complete account had been established, and said that it was idle to say more at present. Mr. Dillon goes to Paris with Messrs. O'Brien and Clancy tomorrow morning. Another Conference, Havre, January 18 John Dillon arrived this afternoon on the steamer La Gascogne from New York. He was met at the pier by Mr. O'Brien, and after an exchange of cordial greetings, the two drove to a hotel, where they at once retired for a private conference. Mr. Dillon was asked his opinion of the political situation, but he declined to make any statement until he had conversed with Messrs. O'Brien and Clancy, and other prominent men of their Irish Parliamentary party. They Saw the Train Lost, January 18 Timothy Healy and Arthur O'Connor were in Mistrim, Longford county, today, it having been arranged for them to deliver addresses there. Shortly after the meeting began, the platform collapsed. Mr. Healy was badly shaken up, but none of those on the platform were seriously injured. Mr. Healy, in his address, accused the Parnellites of having ""sawn the prop"" with the intention of killing their opponents."

The ice flowing on the river Thames between London Bridge and the Tower of London is so packed that the movement of lighters, barges and all craft of that description have ceased.

A number of vessels have parted their anchor chains and are drifting helplessly in the stream. The strongest tugs cannot leave Cuxhaven on account of the ice, and the citizens are assisting the military to blast the ice with melinite. Many Degrees Below Zero.

Timlin Kiu-pmoXI, all down and great damage to trees. Chicago, February 20. Reports received here show that a terrific snow, sleet, and rain storm is raging from the Allegheny mountains as far west as Kansas. In Illinois and Missouri the storm is especially severe. In portions of Illinois and Iowa fruit trees have buckled down under the weight of ice, and street cars were forced to suspend traffic. In Wisconsin the snowstorm was general and caused considerable delay to trains. In South Dakota and at many points in Western and Southern Minnesota the heaviest storm of the winter is raging. It is snowing continuously and the wind has drifted the light snow to such an extent that the railroads are having serious delays in moving trains. Telephonic communication in the several states is greatly interfered with and almost at a standstill. According to the Signal Service Bureau, the present storm had its origin in Southern California. The telegraph service of nearly all the railroads running into this city continues demoralized on account of the sleet storm last night. The Minimum in the Northwest. Mikkhai'Oub, February 20. Reports from all over the Northwest say the heaviest snowstorm of the season prevailed last night, the average fall being about eight inches. There was no wind and no drifts; railway traffic north and west was not affected. Trains from the south, however, were delayed on account of sleet in Southern Wisconsin and Iowa.

By dint of questioning they elicited the fact that he had no practical experience of boilers, that he held no certificate, and that his qualifications for the position consisted of his having been a butcher, carter, grocer, plumber, dry goods merchant, and keeper of a crockery, junk store, and ship chandlery.

It is quite likely that some of the large holdings which were expected to come out to-day were partially liquidated last week, as it is quite evident that there was not much long wheat sold to-day. The New York and St. Louis markets were firm, especially the latter. Cables were strong on decreasing stocks and anticipated light deliveries. Corn was quiet and firm. The action of some Western roads in cutting down their working force was considered as evidence of the scarcity of corn and considerable local buying, the market closing steady at nearly outside figures. Receipts continue small and not equal to the demand for car lots for shipment. Provisions were steady and firm and very dull. The strength was attributed to the firmness in coal and the intimations by well-posted parties that stocks will not show much increase. The close was more active with packers buying lard and pork freely at about the highest quotations. At New York the earlier options closed steady at unchanged prices, but the later options gained. The closing quotations were: $1.00 March, $1.06 May, $1.03 June, $1.00 July, 97c August, 97c September, 93c December.

"18910306","THE QUEBEC DISTRICT A Review of the Provincial Results and its Effect on the Territories Quebec, March 5 The election seemed to monopolize the attention of constituents today and no business was done anywhere. There was a heavy snowstorm lasting nearly all day, which prevented many from coming to the polls, but nevertheless there was a much larger vote polled throughout this district than was expected. The utmost surprise was expressed when telegraph returns announced that the Liberals had rallied in Beauce, Bonaventure, Charlevoix, Kamouraska, Montmagny and Portneuf, but the probability is that by tomorrow some of these counties will be found to have gone Conservative. According to these returns there have been ten Liberals and three Conservatives elected in this district, leaving six seats to hear from, but most of these will undoubtedly go Conservative. Among the gains are Megantic and Rimouski, two constituencies that the Liberals felt certain of. Quebec County, Quebec Centre, and Levis County would undoubtedly have been carried by the Conservatives had the candidates been in the field a few days earlier. Mr. Adolphe Caron has single-handedly redeemed two constituencies, Rimouski and Levis, for in the latter county the returns indicate a majority of from 200 to 300. In Rimouski he has a majority of at least 300. Hon. Francois Langlois received a bad shake in his stronghold, Quebec Centre, and his election by twenty votes is a virtual defeat when his majority of over 700 at the last election is taken into consideration. In Quebec West Hon. Thomas McGroevy increased his majority slightly, and had there been any serious opposition the vote polled would have been very much larger. In Quebec County Hon. Mr. Flynn made a brave fight and would have won the seat had not the whole influence of the local government been brought to bear against him. His opponent, Mayor Ercmont, was supported by the whole Langevin clique, and when it is considered how the national cry was used against him the only wonder is that his defeat was not more decisive. In Levis County Hon. Mr. Paquet may attribute his defeat to the same influence that worked against Mr. Flynn. In both cases money was used unsparingly against the government candidates and nothing was neglected, no matter how contemptible, that would in any way contribute to a victory of the Opposition. It seems impossible that Lafreniere could have been beaten in Bonaventure as stated, for it is hardly likely that in a county of such size the returns could have been collected on the night of the elections. Something very different may be expected tomorrow. In Kamouraska Mr. Choplain was certainly the popular candidate, and if defeated it would be by the most unworthy methods. In the city everything was very quiet, there being not the slightest disturbance, with the exception of a few single-handed scrimmages in Lower Town. In one poll in Quebec West the deputy returning officer made a mistake in neglecting to initial 42 ballots and all were rejected, but it was stated afterwards that the loss to Mr. McGroevy by the error was so slight that it made very little difference. In another poll at the Palais while the deputy returning officer was making his way to the sleigh he slipped and fell and the crowd made a rush at him to take the ballot box from him. Fortunately Detective Walsh was on hand and prevented a very disagreeable complication. The district of Three Rivers has gone just about as was expected. The Conservatives have carried three seats, Maskinonge, St. Minnico and Three Rivers, and the Liberals one, Nicolet, with one seat, Champlain, to hear from. It may, however, be considered as likely for the Conservatives. Sir Hector is another of the ministers whom the Liberals declared to be certain of defeat. In two constituencies, it seems he has carried both. According to the most reliable accounts received here, and these are generally far from being favorable to the Conservative party, out of 250 constituencies heard from the government have carried 110 and the Opposition 61, making a majority for the government of 22. This will be increased by at least eight when the final returns come in."

Attempt at an Old Swindle VICKSBURG, Pa, March 9 The First National Bank of Pittston has received a letter from Spain signed by a priest stating that a vast sum of money is buried somewhere in this vicinity. The letter says that one of the most favored of the courtiers of the late Alfonso was given a large sum of money, said to be a million francs, while the King was on his deathbed in return for the performance of a dying wish. The Queen was jealous of the courtier and at the King's death instructed her ambassador to arrest the courtier for stealing a casket containing a number of jewels from the palace. He fled to America and buried his treasure, but returned to Spain and was arrested and put in prison, where he died. The plans of the place where the treasure was buried were in a satchel which was taken by the tribunal who, not knowing of the contents, offered to dismiss the suit on payment of costs. The priest asks for money to pay the costs and obtain the satchel and plans. A Determined New York Suicide NEW YORK, March 9 John Braum, aged 30, today jumped from the ferryboat James Waterbury, running from Houston Street, this city, to Grand Street, Brooklyn. When the boat had got well out into the stream Braum leaped overboard. Directly he came to the surface the passengers on the boat saw him raise both arms aloft and strike at his head. The Waterbury's engines were stopped, and with boat hooks the deck hands hauled Braum aboard. Strapped to his wrists were two sharp-pointed knives, and with these, while in the water, he had made several severe wounds in his breast, which accounted for the motions that the witnesses to his plunge had seen. The weapons were unstrapped and Braum, after the Brooklyn slip had been reached, was taken to the hospital. The surgeon who attended him said he was not likely to recover. The Fatal Electric Light Wire Albany, March 9 Wires from the Telephone exchange came in contact with the trolley wires of the Broadway Electric Railway tonight and the immediate result was a fire which completely disabled the telephone service and caused a loss of $30,000 to the Hudson River Telephone Company. There was a novel display of pyrotechnics as the telephone wires, unable to carry the current from the trolley wires, became red hot and fell to the ground in pieces. One of the horses of the fire department stepped on a fallen wire and fell dead. An engineer was badly injured. A man was also injured, but quickly recovered. The fire did not burn a great deal, but the valuable switchboard in the telephone office was destroyed, and this caused the loss. Was it a Royalty on Nickel Steel Washington, March 9 Since the United States has commenced to experiment with nickel steel for armor plating a syndicate of European capitalists, including Schneider & Co., of Le Creusot, the French armor makers, has set up a claim for a royalty of two cents a pound on all nickel steel armor made, claiming that its patents cover the process. This claim will be contested by Carnegie, Phipps & Co., of Pittsburgh, who have begun the manufacture of nickel steel, and claim to use processes not covered by the Schneider patents. In the contract with Carnegie, Phipps & Co., by the Navy Department it is stipulated that the Government shall retain the amount claimed as royalty pending the decision of the courts. Returned the Table Dalltim Chicago, March 9 Driven to desperation by abuse the wife of a salesman named Henry Akin attempted to kill her husband yesterday by shooting him in the head. Akin went home drunk and began quarreling. He seized his wife and was choking her, as usual. She had prepared herself for such an incident and jerking a revolver from her pocket fired it in his face. Their three small children screamed with fright and the police running in placed husband and wife under arrest. Akin will recover, but will be noseless and bear a scar four inches long across his cheek. Terrible Indiana Tragedy BATAVIA, Ind, March 9 Yesterday John Dirschure, a well-known hotelkeeper, while drunk and mad with jealousy shot his wife, inflicting a serious wound. Dirschure then placed the revolver at the back of his three-year-old daughter Myrtle and shot her through the heart.

All the crew and passengers were drowned. The British ship Dryand, Capt. Thomas, bound from Shields for Valparaiso, has also been wrecked off Start Point. Her crew, consisting of 24 men and officers, have been drowned. Among the schooners lost off Start Point was the Lannendale. Four of her crew were drowned. Her captain was saved. The schooner Lizzie Ellen was also lost and two of her crew were drowned. It is known that at least seventy lives have been lost off the coast during the blizzard, and in addition at least ten men perished from cold and exposure after reaching the shore. It is feared the list of wrecks and the record of lives lost is far from complete, as several vessels are missing. Many Points Still Isolated Many points inland, where the storm was most severely felt, are still isolated from the surrounding country, and days must elapse before through freight and passenger traffic is entirely restored on the branch lines of the railroads. The severity of the storm and the difficulty of restoring the lines of communication to their usual state of usefulness may be judged from the fact that an express train which left Plymouth on Monday is still blocked up near the Brent river. The passengers are suffering from exposure. Gangs of laborers numbering hundreds have been sent from all directions to clear the railroad lines in Devonshire and Cornwall, where the snowdrifts have piled up so heavily that cuttings twelve feet deep have to be made through the snow, which is now frozen into an almost solid mass. The loss to farm stock is enormous and will entail much suffering among the farmers, who have already lost considerably by the terrible weather experienced at the end of last year. Water Famine Threatened The water mains at Plymouth are snowed up to such an extent that a force of 200 soldiers from the garrison has been sent to assist the waterworks employees in clearing them to an extent which will enable them to be used. No water has passed through the mains since Monday and a water famine is now added to the other sufferings which the people of Plymouth have had to endure through the terrible blizzard which has caused so much distress in England. Following the blizzard a severe frost has set in all over England. The frost is greatly hindering the clearing of the railroad lines which were blocked by snow drifts. Cornwall continues isolated from the rest of England. While a gang of men were working today on a train which had broken down on the Great Western railway, they were run down by a relief train sent to the scene. Two men were killed and seven others fatally injured.

The speech from the throne practically contained nothing, and the Opposition had a grand opportunity to attack Attorney-General Blair, who was met with loud applause as he referred to the Quebec conference and the resolution passed at it of unrestricted reciprocity, which he voted for. Mr. Hanington then interjected how Blair threw himself into a campaign in defense of this and how he was supported from all parts of New Brunswick. Messrs.

disaster to the steamer Utopia: The list of the saved embraces two cabin passengers, 200 steerage passengers and 25 of the crew Fifteen of the crew and 470 passengers were lost The ship was not insured The cargo intended for Mediterranean ports was valued at $300,000 and the steamship at $400,000 The passengers left will be brought over on the steamship Assyria of the same line, which was at Genoa at the time of the accident but has been ordered to Gibraltar By this delay the Utopia's passengers will not arrive until after the new law that no immigrant without personal effects shall be permitted to land goes into effect Colonel Weber said today that the survivors of the Utopia would probably be examined at Gibraltar and the destitute and sick and crippled left behind, only those

Litigation St. John's, Kild, March 18 Judgment in the famous case of Baird vs. Sir Baldwin Walker, commander of the British warship Emerald, was given by the Supreme Court here today James Baird sued Captain Sir Baldwin Walker for $8,000 damages for forcibly closing his lobster factory on the French shore of Newfoundland under the alleged authority of the modus vivendi concluded between France and England in regard to the French shore embroglio The facts were admitted and the law points argued for Sir Baldwin Walker by Sir William Whiteway, premier of the colony, acting as attorney for the Imperial Government Captain Walker pleaded as his justification that he was acting under the orders of the British Government The Supreme Court decided that the modus vivendi was not legal without parliamentary sanction, inasmuch as it was not a treaty with the Sovereign prerogative, and that Sir Baldwin Walker's unlawful action of forcibly closing the lobster factory was not defensible as an act of State, because the State has no power to interfere with the property of British subjects The court intimated that the Imperial Government was morally bound to indemnify Sir Baldwin Walker, but Sir Baldwin was personally responsible to Baird for the losses inflicted because of his summary action As the Imperial Government had declared its intention to recompense all those who had suffered loss on the French shore consequent upon the enforcement of the modus vivendi, and as this action was only decided to ascertain the exact legal rights of the British Government in enforcing the provisions of the old treaties in Newfoundland, the court expressed the hope that further litigation would cease and that all the sufferers would be speedily paid their losses The Chief Justice added in a significant tone of voice that Newfoundland was a self-governing colony and that no citizen of the island should be interfered with by persons, no matter how great their authority, without prompt redress in the courts The decision, while fully anticipated, gives the greatest satisfaction The case was prosecuted to a successful issue by ex-Attorney General Sir James Winter The British Government will now be crowded with scores of claims for damages and alleged damages from the acts of Imperial naval officers in defining and regulating the rights of the Newfoundland fishermen in their own waters out of deference to the French Fortunately for the Imperial Government the whole question of lobsters on the French shore has been referred to arbitration THE DAILY RECORD - JERSEY

with the success of the experiment Mr. Phelps, at a series of dinners which he has given here, has given his guests American beef and has thus introduced its use in the families of many distinguished members of the fashionable circles of Berlin The Hamburg local officials are making costly permanent improvements in the landing facilities now at the disposal of the importers of American cattle in order to encourage the trade in these cattle The cattle on arriving at Hamburg are examined by the veterinary surgeons of the port and when pronounced entirely healthy are landed from the steamship and driven to a large airy building built of iron and stone, where they are at once sold to butchers The custom up to quite recently has been to keep American cattle under surveillance or quarantine

primest Norfolks, 4s 10d The sheep trade, which was confined to the Islington market, was a better one for consignors, particularly so on Thursday, when an early clearance was made at an advance of 2d per 8 lbs for all descriptions over Monday's rates, which were also 2d higher than was obtainable last week The block of meat in transit through the severe snowstorms caused the meat market to be shorter of mutton, consequently buyers flocked to this market Lambs were fully 4d per 8 lbs dearer on this latter day We received 12,670 British sheep and lambs, and 82 Dutch;

I assured him there would not be, Mr. Barrett had expressed wish to be buried as a Catholic, Knowing, as I do, the Archbishop's views on the Masonic question I did not ask for permission for a church burial nor to administer the full rites of the church after death, That can only be done when the dying person renounces all his evil doings, When I began to administer the sacrament to Mr. Barrett he was unconscious in the middle of it but later opened his eyes and recognized me, I told him I was anointing him and he said thank you, I told him to hold out his hand and he did so, From his willingness to receive the sacrament I inferred he wished to die a member of the Catholic church, Her Piano Goes In Free, Washington, March 25, The collector of customs at Port Huron, Mich, recently denied an application for the free entry as a professional instrument, of a piano imported from Canada on the ground that the owner, a young lady of 17 years, had not taught music prior to coming to this country, He held she could not be considered a music teacher by profession and therefore the piano could not be considered an instrument of her profession, The case was appealed to the Treasury department and evidence was submitted that the young lady had studied music in Canada and had come to the United States to teach piano music, She had secured nine pupils in this country when the piano was seized, Assistant Secretary Spaulding has decided that the piano comes within the purview of paragraph C86 of the free list as it was imported as a means of gaining a livelihood, He has instructed the collector to admit the instrument to free entry upon the importer taking the proper oath and paying the expenses of seizure, A Serious Western University, Chicago, March 25, The Tribune declares editorially that no prudent parent can be justified in keeping a daughter in the female department of the Northwestern University at Evanston so long as the policy of the present management continues, It says the building is unsafe and is deficient in fire escapes, There would be an awful loss of life if there should be a fire at night, Oil lamps are used instead of gas and the building is overcrowded, Since the elevator was abolished delicate girls are compelled to climb four flights of stairs several times daily, This condition of affairs is not due to lack of funds as the institution clears several thousand dollars yearly by boarding girl students, The editorial creates a sensation, A large number of students are from New York, Pennsylvania and the Eastern States, General Lake Strike Threatened, Chicago, March 25, A marine trade council will meet next Sunday with a view to forming a general alliance of all the organizations whose members are connected with the shipping interests on the lakes, The delegates from the coal heaters and trimmers, grain trimmers, lumber shovers' union and Lake Seamen's Benevolent Association will be present, The members of the Seamen's Association are unanimous in demanding a uniform increase in wages to $2 per day on the opening of navigation, If this is not conceded the seamen are preparing to enforce their demands by a general strike, The seamen claim there is a mere handful of non-union men in the city and that hardly a vessel will be able to leave the Chicago River without the consent of their organizations, Kicaraman Will Object, WASHINGTON, March 25, Senor Guzman, the Nicaraguan minister, was asked today if there was anything in the Sherman-Nicaraguan Canal bill that he thought would not be acceptable to his Government, He answered yes; there are two things in the bill that Nicaragua cannot admit: first, the duty of the Canal, which is referred to in the bill as a revenue duty, Nicaragua could never allow a foreign government to give authority for revenue on her territory, and secondly, Nicaragua's rights, according to article 30 of her constitution, the amount of revenue would be limited to six percent, the minister said, refers it to the letter, The Sherman bill was on the Senate order of business, but there was not enough time remaining at the fifty-first Congress to pass it, A New Forgery Scheme, ROCHESTER, N.Y."

It is convinced the American Government will readily make the compensation which justice demands. Public opinion goes to show that no sympathy for the lynched Mafiosi is manifested.

The correspondent adds: There never has been the slightest pretext for an appeal to arms in connection with the affair. The Workmen's Congress Demand. PARIS, March 30.

"18910414","AWFUL DISTRESS IN CHILE, Vagabond Plundering and Murdering The Misery Appalling Minister Declared Trailers, Panama, April 13, Advices from Chile state that at Iquique vagabonds are robbing, plundering, murdering, violating women and committing all classes of atrocities, while incendiaries also are at work. The distress along the south coast, due to the revolution, is appalling. General Urrutia, who commands Iquique, has been selling flour at 22 cents per pound. Hundreds of men have abandoned the nitrate works and only carrying bottles of water and accompanied by their families, have trudged across the deserts. The scene hardly finds an equal in the history of war and revolt. The rebel forces which fought around Pocoalmon's and near Iquique last month numbered 4,000 men, while the Government troops reached barely 3,000. The dead in the different actions numbered 900 and include many high officials. The rebels finally won and captured 30 cannon and Gatling guns. Mr. Miguel Mattin, Chilean minister in the Argentine Republic, and Senor Antonrz, Chilean minister in France, have been declared traitors by President Balmaceda. They placed Government funds at the disposal of the rebels.

A disgruntled stockholder's petition, Boston, April 13, The minority stockholders of the Para Rubber Shoe Company, of this city, have petitioned the Supreme Court for the appointment of a receiver for the company and to order an accounting. The bill alleges fraud and the insolvency of the company. The company has been doing a business of from $1,500,000 to $2,500,000 a year. The capital stock is $1,000,000, and of this amount the officers of the company are said to own or control about two-thirds. Mr. Jaquith, who files the bill, says he represents all the stock not owned by the officers. George D. Clapp, one of the company's directors, paid today that the suit would amount to little. ""It is instigated,"" said he, ""by a small stockholder with whom we have had trouble. The Para Rubber Shoe Company is perfectly sound and the books of the company have been thrown open and audited every year, so there was no need of asking the court to compel us to make an accounting."" President Coolidge, of the Shoe Company, having intimated that Jaquith was attempting blackmail. Jaquith has sued him for slander and attached his property. A notable incident, New York, April 13, Austin Corbin, president of the Long Island Railroad, ex-president of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, and known as one of the largest owners of the stock of the New Jersey Central Railroad, was blackballed by the governors of the Union Club at their regular monthly meeting last Wednesday evening. This can only be explained on the theory that the feeling against railroad presidents inside the Union Club must be growing very rapidly. The blackballing of Austin Corbin two years ago is regarded by a great many men as an interesting development of the antagonism of certain elements in the Union Club towards millionaires and the club that the millionaires are organizing and which is to be located at the entrance to Central Park. Idaho Indian on the Rampage, Pocatello, Idaho, April 13, Great excitement was caused here today by the discovery that Indians had killed two unknown white immigrants camped at a water tank one mile from here.

Deputy Sheriff Ross took charge of the bodies, leaving an armed posse on guard. Business is suspended and the citizens are up in arms. About 100 armed mounted men have left the city to demand the surrender of the guilty parties. Should the Indians refuse to surrender the murderers, trouble is sure to follow. Not an Indian was to be found in the city an hour after the affair. Indians Lose All Their Stock, Denver, April 13, Reports from the Southern Ute Agency are to the effect that the Indians have lost nearly all their stock by heavy snowstorms. The snow covered the ground to a depth of four feet and horses and cattle by the thousands starved to death. The Ute, Moache, and Capote had 17,000 horses and as many cattle, of which they lost all but 15 percent. The Apaches in New Mexico, who own the largest herds of sheep and horses of any people in America, lost entire herds by the storm and their losses are incalculable."

The steamer Danube arrived from the northern canneries this morning, bringing the crew of the sealing schooner Adele, which was wrecked on a small island northwest of Queen Charlotte. The Adele went on the rocks during April 8, and when the tide fell the vessel's keel was broken and two large holes were found in the hull. The crew stripped her of her sails, rigging, and stores, and then burned the hull to obtain the copper fastenings. They started for Massett in a canoe, and from there crossed in the ship's boat to Fort Simpson, where they met the Danube. The Adele was commanded by Captain Hansen, and was the schooner which raided the seal rookeries last year. The vessel was valued at $5,000, and is believed to be uninsured. The canneries in northern British Columbia are nearly all ready for the spring catch, which is expected to be very good this season. John Doild, a waiter at the Buss house, attempted suicide this morning by cutting his throat. He was under the influence of drink when he committed the act. He was removed to the Jubilee hospital, and it is now believed he will recover. FROM THE ANCIENT CAPITAL Harbor master Goudrean Dead Buried Vestments To Be Worn By The Cardinal A Flan Story General Notes (From our own correspondent) QUEBEC, May 12 Captain Goudrean, harbor master, died last night after a short illness. He was 80 years of age. Ludger Grenier, employed by F. Marcoux, of Beanport, was floating logs in the Montmorency River yesterday when he fell into the water and was rescued with great difficulty after being badly bruised by the floating logs. The translation of the remains of the three Jesuit fathers from the vaults of Belmont cemetery to the Ursuline convent took place today with great ceremony. The procession was headed by children of the various Catholic institutions. Following them came delegations of the learned professions; then came the remains of the Jesuit fathers borne by Huron Indians. Jesuit priests followed as chief mourners. Then came a body of Montagnais Indians, among whom Father De Queu, discoverer of Lake St. John, labored. Then came the Lieutenant-Governor, accompanied by Hon. Milette, Garceau, and Boss. Pro-Mayor Keroak and members of the corporation followed, and the rear of the procession was brought up by the St. Jean Baptiste society and the general public. The bands of B Battery and the Militia were in the procession. The remains were first brought to the Jesuit church on the esplanade, where the Libera was sung by Archbishop Fabre. The procession then wended its way to the Basilica, where a sermon was preached by Mgr. Paquet, rector of Laval, and another Libera was sung by Mgr. Fabre. Eight bishops were in attendance. The remains were then conveyed to the chapel of the Ursuline convent, B Battery band playing the ""Dead March"" as a voluntary, before the last Libera was sung by Mgr. Duhamel, with a choir of cloistered nuns posted in the building immediately adjoining the chapel. The effect was very fine. The remains were then deposited beneath the altar and this closed the very imposing ceremony. At pontifical Mass in the cathedral tomorrow morning the Cardinal will wear the vestments presented to the diocese by King Louis XIV. His Eminence will also wear a rochet which belonged to Mgr. Laval and use the same chalice as the venerable first bishop of Quebec. Telephore Paradis has been appointed by the court liquidator of the insolvent Laval boot and shoe factory. Councillor Molmin caught eight trout, ranging from three to five pounds, in two hours, while waiting on the wharf at Ruborval the other day."
"18910721","(N.Y. Times) London, July 18 There has probably been no time during the past ten years when the German Emperor could so ill afford to be out of the closest touch of his ministers, marshals and allies. The air is thick, darkening with omens. Famine, disease, and war are raven cries around us. If there be any single cause that could hasten the rupture of the present ruinous armed peace, it would be the failure of the Russian harvest, for which recent intelligence prepares us. Russia is an immense country, with vast resources and a rapidly growing population. This population is intellectually as backward as the people of Western Europe were in the Middle Ages. Moreover, it is ground down under the burden of tax upon tax made necessary by the state's enormous military expenditure until it is only held in submission by severe repressive measures; but if famine be added to the present hardships, no repressive measures would suffice. Famine was the ultimate determining cause of the French Revolution, and France was not then more seething with disaffection than Russia is today. It has always been the practice of the Russian rulers, when the internal situation became overwhelmingly critical, to divert the attention of the people from the troubles by appeals to arms. The Czar, perhaps, does not wish to fight, but he is now probably as fully prepared for war as he can hope to be. France, no doubt, will strive by every means to restrain him as long as may be, but if the question arose of a possible internal convulsion in Russia, the French desire for further preparation would meet with small respect. The fact that by reason of her shameful persecution of the Jews all the great Jewish financial houses in Western Europe are hostile to Russia and determined to use all the weight of their influence to depress Russian credit greatly complicates the situation. France is anxious to support Russian credit and to enable Russia to play a great part in international politics, but so much French wealth has been recently wasted that it becomes questionable how far Paris banks may be able to counterbalance the Jewish hostility. A possible position of the Russian population between famine at home and war on the border is almost too terrible to contemplate. THE WORK OF FAMINE From what outside charity could they hope to obtain relief? We have no record of any great famine in Russia, though dearth and drought have played havoc all around the skirts of the vast empire at quickly recurrent intervals throughout the past fifty years. In India, between the years 1837 and 1869, 13,500,000 perished of famine; in China, in 1877-8, 9,600,000; in India in the same year the extent of distress arising from famine may be gathered from the fact that the Mansion House relief fund opened in London August 15, amounted a few months later to over £516,000, which sum was sent to India in January, 1878. In the following year destructive snowstorms in Cashmere were the main cause of the famine, entailing terrible loss of life; in 1880, in the huge province of Taurus; in 1887, throughout the whole of Asia Minor and in China in 1887-9, in consequence of the overflowing of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, famine decimated the populations of enormous tracts of country; but in each and all of these periods of distress lavish aid for the sufferers was contributed by the great European nations. Russia, it is true, has never helped any foreign country in distress, and now, in her trouble, if it should come, it is difficult to see where she can look for aid."

The trotting stallion Advance was sold by his owner, Howard Cunningham, to Mr. Nuttall, of Michigan, for $76,000. Advance was foaled in 1883. He is by Onward, dam Mist, record 2:28, by Klug Bene, second dam Snowbird, by Steele's Snowstorm. The price is not an extravagant one, as Advance, although but eight years old, is the sire of Swanson, 2:23 at three years, and several other colts about to enter the thirty list. Advance himself has a record of 2:24. His new owner expects to keep him at his stock farm at Keota, Iowa after September 1, at which time he is to take the horse. A Racing War in Chicago, Chicago, July 23. A merry racing war between Ed. Corrigan and George Hanklin and John Condon began yesterday, and the prospect is that lovers of contests on the turf will in the near future be enabled to witness them free of cost, even of transportation to the tracks. Corrigan yesterday morning distributed thousands of posters stating admission to his Hawthorne track would for the present be free. It is expected the Garfield Park club will retaliate in like manner, and it is then hinted that Corrigan will charter free trains for his patrons, and his rivals may follow suit. It will be war to the bitter end, as Corrigan declares he will spend half a million dollars to down his enemies. Not So Big as They Look, That the net value of a big take usually figures a great deal more on paper than it realizes to the owner of the winning horse, every turfman knows, and that the more valuable the event, the larger the discrepancy, is natural in proportion. When Potomac won the Realization stakes at Sheepshead Bay, a couple of weeks ago, and the value to the winner was estimated, it was found to be about $31,000. Mr. Michael Dwyer was warmly congratulated on all sides upon the fact that the horse had paid for his purchase with the one victory. Mr. Dwyer acknowledged them all, though he probably made a rapid mental calculation, based on many previous experiences, and came to the conclusion that a good deal of that velvet on Potomac would be inferior goods. As a matter of fact, of the $31,000 that Potomac was supposed to net his owner by the Realization victory, about $13,000 of it represents unpaid forfeits that came under the head of very doubtful collateral. When Mr. Dwyer's winnings are figured up at the end of the year, this $13,000 will be included, Potomac will be credited with it in his earnings, and the winnings of the get of St. Blaise will also be swelled by that amount. That the horse won the money there can be no question, but that Mr. Dwyer will ever get any considerable amount of it is exceedingly doubtful. It would seem that the board of control might devise some means by which stake earnings would mean that amount of money to the winners. There is not much satisfaction in a system of entrance, and payment of entrance money, by which an owner ties less than two-thirds of what he really wins. The Twin City Derby, St. Paul, July 22.

It is the highly digestible quality of the oyster that makes it so desirable as food and gives it the foremost place at feasts. Like Sir John Falstaff, who was not only witty himself, but the cause of wit to other men, the oyster is not only digestible itself, but it is also the cause of digestibility to other lands, thus being a double blessing. Oysters are recommended as a sovereign cure for the grippe, and they are good for old people when other food fails. They are equally good for young people and for the middle-aged, and for those who are neither young nor old. The cookery books devote live spaces to the precious bivalve and give many receipts for its kitchen treatment, but as the fisherman remarked, the best way to cook an oyster is to eat him raw.

Sanitary regulations, both Imperial and local, are coming more and more to be based on the results of accurate scientific research into the causes of disease; philanthropists are working on the lines of sanitary reform; and, behind it all, there is the invaluable stimulus of the intelligent public, who have learned that there is at least a substratum of truth in the old adage that health is wealth. And what is the result? Take this metropolis alone. In the ten years ending 1869, the inhabitants of London died at an average annual rate of twenty-four for every thousand living: in the ten years ending 1889, that rate was only twenty. In other words, over 17,000 lives were being annually saved in that decade in London; and the mortality is still far too great. The saving affected has been largely from the preventable diseases, a class of disease so especially fatal to men and women during the wage-earning period of life, a period when death casts upon the surviving public the onerous burden of supporting those whom it was the pride and happiness of the breadwinner himself to support. Besides which prevention of these diseases means a diminution of preventable sickness, and this carries with it a lessening of domestic misery and an increase of individual vigor and happiness. It is no vain insular boast when we say that Great Britain stands first among the nations in this matter. The palm of preeminence has thus far been generally conceded to us, and we wish, if we can, to retain it. But we are being hardly pressed, and by none more closely than by our fellows, the English-speaking nations of both hemispheres. But in these days of rapid transit, the sanitary condition of any one nation is more than ever a matter of concern to its neighbors. This is especially exemplified in the matter of quarantine. It was long the universally recognized custom in the case of epidemics of cholera and plague to tend to protect people from the incursion of the disease by drawing imaginary lines round the populations; in fact, so-called cordons and quarantines instead of taking steps to provide a complete system of sanitary administration. We in this country have discovered that, if we give our seaports and our country generally an efficient sanitary administration and keep our towns clean, it is unnecessary in the presence of cholera to revert to an empty and antiquated form, which does untold harm by giving a feeling of false security, and which operates mischievously both in health and in commerce. Since this attitude was definitely adopted, we have in England and Wales spent nearly nine million sterling per annum upon measures for promoting public health and in removing the causes of disease. The result is that, while cholera, when imported, has gained no footing among us, hundreds of thousands of valuable lives have been spared, the remunerative capacity and the vigor of the people have been improved, and the costly item of preventable disease and death has undergone a diminution that could hardly have been anticipated. Sir Douglas Galton in the Nineteenth Century. The Coming Winter. It is just as well to lay in a supply of coal and stove wood and warm funnels. Professor Foster, who is Iowa's weather prophet, says of the coming winter: It will be the coldest and most stormy, with the greatest snowstorms, especially deep and drifting snows that have been experienced for many years. Cold weather with blizzards and drifting snows will begin early in October in the elevated region of Colorado and the Dakotas, and very cold weather, earlier than usual, will cover the states and territories of the Northwest and the Missouri River valleys. While the very deep snows that will fall and the numerous fierce storms that will occur, travel and transportation will be greatly impeded. About the middle of December the weather will become warmer and average so till about the 1st of January, 1892, when the cold waves will come again and January and February will average colder than has been experienced in many years past. In effect, I have made these statements heretofore through the public press and in my lectures, and my reasons for making these predictions are based on identically the same causes as were my predictions that proved to be so accurate for the winter of 1890-91.

German Nightfall Declines to Support an Anarchistic Speech An uproar in the Congress. EiruiT, October 19. At today's session of the Socialist congress Herr Auerbach made a violent speech in defense of anarchy. This speech was full of the most bitter denunciations of the existing systems of government and society and caused such an uproar upon the part of the more sober-minded portion of the delegates that the congress was upon the point of electing a committee to request the expulsion of the member who supported the anarchistic views of the speaker when Herr Auerbach, who had taken his seat during the tumult, again arose and, amid a scene of uproarious disorder, announced the secession from the Socialist party of himself and of Herren Enwerner, Wilburner, Schultz, of Magdeburg, and Brethge, of Berlin. All five of the delegates immediately withdrew from the hall. Herr Singer read a letter from the seceding extremists in which the seceders declared that they would no longer belong to a party which called itself the Socialist party while it renounced democratic principles. The congress thereupon adopted a resolution advising the Socialists of Berlin to take measures to render abortive any further action by the extremists as the latter rely chiefly upon their comrades in Berlin for support. NOTES FROM THE CAPITAL. A Montreal grocery firm's agent shipped out trouble on the Gatineau Valley Railway. (From our own correspondent) Ottawa, October 19. Under the heading 'Gone No Address,' the Free Press tonight publishes a story about an agent for a Montreal grocery firm, who has been stopping at the Russell house with his wife and two sisters for some time past, having skipped out without paying his bill and also leaving a number of other creditors. The Free Press mysteriously adds: 'There are still more serious charges rumored against the gentleman in question which are meantime best left as rumors.' It is said here that the gentleman referred to is ill in the General Hospital, Montreal. The Journal states tonight that about 400 men at work on the Gatineau Valley railway have not been paid for several weeks and that a strike will probably take place in a day or two. The men employed are nearly all Italians. Postmaster General Unggart has gone to Perth for a few days' holidays. Hon. Frank Smith, acting minister of public works, returned to the city today. It is understood that nothing has yet been settled about the tenders for the Toronto drill hall, but the matter will probably come up at tomorrow's meeting of the Council. Chamberlin, Queen's printer, who has been indisposed for some time, was able today to be at his department, but is still far from well. Dr. Chipman, house surgeon of the Protestant hospital, is very ill with typhoid fever, of which there are a large number of cases in the city, and his recovery is doubtful."
"18911024","H. McOrevy and Owen Kngene Murphy have been found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. They have also been permitted to escape from the jurisdiction of the court, and it is said, to take with them a number of documents of record, in the custody of the court, having an important bearing on the case. Their trial was put off at a previous term of the court under circumstances that reflected seriously on the methods of administering justice in this province, and that caused much comment at the time, the inference being that political influence was exerted in their behalf in order that when they came to give evidence during the investigation at Ottawa their reputations would not be stripped of every shred of respectability. Now that they have been found guilty of a grave crime, and have fled, it is discovered that one of them was under only $100 bail, while the other had given no bail at all. Such a series of incidents, if due to carelessness, would constitute a crime. The history of the case, however, makes it hard to believe that such gross neglect was only the result of an oversight. Public confidence in the administration of justice in Quebec has received a severe shock. A correspondent asks the meaning of the words migration, emigration, and immigration he sees so often in print. In the newspaper sense, as generally used, migration is a movement of the people, the tendency being to use it as confined to a movement of the people within the limits of the country or region in which it originates. Emigration is a movement out of, and immigration a movement into a country or region. A correspondent should buy a dictionary. Erastus Wiman is out with a pamphlet arguing that the annexation of Canada to the United States is an impossibility. This is for circulation in Canada.

That was for circulation in the United States. Erastus will write or say anything.

"18911103","THE UNITED KINGDOM A curious piece of news has found a place among our recent despatches from Europe An attempt, it appears, has been made to galvanize into sentimental vitality the Jacobite cause It is nearly a century and a half since the struggle between the Stuarts and the House of Hanover ended in the discomfiture of the former Though the rising of 1745 found the British Government off its guard, Falkirk was destined to be the exiled Princes' last success, and since Culloden the military partisans of the dethroned line have either served in foreign armies or have taken the better part of fighting their country's battles against foreign foes The conquest of Canada, half a generation after Cumberland's victory, furnished illustrations of both kinds of allegiance representatives of the Highland clans having fought under both Montcalm and Wolfe But if the Stuart cause, as a disturbing element in English politics, died an inevitable death, it still held the fortress of romantic imagination and feeling, and Jacobite song and romance have played no slight or empty part even in the training of English soldiers and the winning of English triumphs When Charles Mackay lectured here under the auspices of the Mercantile Library Association, he showed by abundant examples the power of Jacobite songs and airs over the hearts not only of Scotchmen but of Irishmen and Englishmen There must be something peculiarly fascinating in their appeals to patriotic pride and the unutterable pathos that clings around the memories of home, to have made them favorite songs with those who hated the principles which they espoused At the same time their popularity south of the Tweed must be regarded as evidence that long before Scott or even Burns had become names of power, the day had gone by when Jacobite enthusiasm was a danger to the Crown In Ireland Jacobitism was more religious than political, and although the chiefs of the old Septs as well as the Catholic Anglo-Irish fought with characteristic courage for the Stuarts, their service had nothing of that chivalrous devotion which the Highlanders cherished for the kingly heads of their race Ireland never produced any Jacobite poetry worth mentioning nor, indeed, until Moore had taken up his abode in England and begun to sing his more or less rebellious melodies in English drawing rooms, had Ireland found a rhythmic voice that Englishmen could understand Before Moore passed away, the Young Ireland movement had come and gone like a literary meteor Though more impassioned in their language than the ""Irish Melodies"" (which are well named, if we have regard to the smooth flow of the metre and generally happy airs to which they are set), the songs of the ""Nation"" are not more meritorious as poetry than those of Moore While in Ireland it was a punishable offense to whistle what the stolid self-respect and exclusive tastes of the Ulsterman might consider a party tune, in England the most defiant of Irish ballads were sung and heard without resentment Not only so but, however each successive movement of Irish nationalism may for a time have deepened the lines of division in Ireland itself between Celt and Saxon, Protestant and Catholic, the ultimate result has been a better understanding between the members of both creeds and both races To-day Irish nationalism (in so far as it implies a desire for separation) is virtually as sentimental as Scotch Jacobitism At this very moment and when the two factions of the Irish Home Rulers are making such a din among themselves, we find the leader of one of them discussing in a magazine not any phase of the question or the quarrel about which the fellow citizens of Father Prott have been smashing each other's skulls, but ""Women in English Politics"" Save for a casual reference to it as the great barrier to the prosecution of other business in Parliament, Home Rule might be a question of which Mr. McCarthy had only heard at second-hand Here in England, we in England, our county councils, and so on - in this way, with an unconsciousness which is far more significant than any deliberate purpose, this Home Rule reader identifies himself with English politics, English society, English progress It may be said that Mr. McCarthy is a man of letters and that he chose his themes and his mode of speech to suit the larger audience for which he writes But this article in the North American simply exemplifies leanings equally pronounced both affirmatively and negatively in his historical works and his novels He is an Englishman and he does not wish to be anything else Of the from eighty to a hundred other Home Rulers who are or have been in Parliament, we venture to say that a considerable proportion would prefer the British to the Irish metropolis as the scene of either a political or a social career As for science and letters London is fast becoming the centre for the English-speaking race all over the world Thither flock aspirants from the ends of the earth, and as for Ireland, the fashion set by Moore has been so faithfully followed that some of even the Nation's contributors have become thoroughly Anglicized and their sons and daughters are proud to call themselves English The new blood that the Parnellite movement and the enlarged franchise brought to Westminster still further extends through Ireland the knowledge of the English people, and even though the acquaintance be first made in the din of political strife, the ultimate issue must be the removal of old prejudices and antipathies Thus Saxon and Norman came to know and respect each other after centuries of feud; thus Cymric Wales made peace with the invader after generations of war; thus, from Bannockburn to Culloden, Southron and Scot learned to prize each other's virtues, and thus the very battle for its repeal is making the union of England and Ireland more solid and fruitful every year The United States Secretary of the Navy does not think war will arise out of the Valparaiso incident There are two reasons to back this Chile does not want war and neither does the United States A war between the two powers would be largely a naval one, and while the end would be certain, the chances are all that at the beginning Chile would have the best of it She has more heavy armored battleships than the United States, which power is especially weak on the Pacific, having only a small number of warships and none of the coaling stations that would be essential in a prolonged struggle with the pugnacious Chileans Chile would have everything to lose in a war with a power like the United States It is safe to say that the jingoism will gradually disappear from the despatches between the diplomats, and that in a brief time dove-eyed peace will once more be brooding o'er the pleasant scene and the place where Minister Egan made his mistakes L'EUcUut, which is Picaud, who claims to be a man, thinks the Bale des commissioners will declare that the Lieutenant-Governor was warranted in taking the steps he did to so inquiry, but that the evidence proves the transaction to be perfectly regular as ministers, and that the Count's friends look forward to the future with confidence This is a fine programme, intimating that Count has had his notes paid; Longoller, the Count's colleague, has a mansion paid for out of the Picaud has bought another mansion; a hundred other Liberals have benefited in various sums from fifty to a thousand dollars a piece and it is all right It is quite evident his examination did not shake Picaud's nerve Judge Wortele in his address to the grand jury yesterday uttered a warning to persons addicted to fast driving in the streets His Honor put it very clearly that at the crossings the pedestrian has the right of way The average driver is, perhaps, fairly careful in observing the law, but there are enough of the reckless kind to frequently imperil limb or even life These, as well as the police who are not always as zealous in this duty as they might be, may find it profitable to give heed to the Judge's remarks A prosecution for misdemeanor is not a pleasant thing to take chances on At Charlottetown, in 1878, Sir Richard Cartwright declared that while friendly trade relations with the United States were desirable, we were not in such an abject state that we could not live without them; that if we were not treated fairly we would find new markets for ourselves and cut our rivals out That was backbone Since 1878 Sir Richard has become a moral mollusk on the trade issue, Canadian egg dealers, who since May have shipped eighteen million eggs to the British market and outmaneuvered McKinley, hold that Sir Richard's first thoughts are best Five hundred convicts let loose by the Tennessee strikers against convict labor in the mines is a practical protest against the Southern system of convict treatment that will attract attention outside the interested state That number of criminals can hardly be let out upon society without some innocent person being made to suffer before they are recaged or settle down to honest work Portable property will be at a discount in the affected locality for a time The St. John Telegraph (Liberal) printed the Ottawa Free Press slander about Picaud making a gift to a member of the Lieutenant-Governor's family out of the Bale des Chalmers plunder It has not printed any of the plentiful denials that have been made both by the Lieutenant-Governor and Mr. Tactud The Telegraph had better act a manly part; it has no chance of winning the prize for meanness in competition with its Ottawa colleague The Herald yesterday had a very pointed article on the appointment of the new inspectors under the recent cattle shipping regulations As the article assumed that the inspectors were to inspect cattle, whereas their duty is to inspect ships, the points will hardly have the penetrating effect the editor calculated upon The Herald would get many points on how not to make an exhibition of itself by reading the Gazette According to the New York Sun Mr. Charles Langelier, the Count Mercier's colleague, has been telling the St. Louis Chronicle unrestricted reciprocity is the first step to annexation It was the Globe's editor, Mr. Fairer, who wrote that a good many annexationist favorers of the Liberal trade fad questioned the wisdom of making two bites of a cherry Mr. Langelier's and Mr. Fairer's minds seem to run in the same direction The state of Ohio elects a governor today One of the candidates is named McKinley He was the author of a measure passed by the United States Congress which some politicians predicted would drive Canada into annexation within a year A reference to back numbers of the newspapers shows that the year is up With sharp frosts in England, heavy frosts in Hamburg and snowstorms in Greece, it looks as if an early winter was about to settle down, happy is the man whose coal bin is full Eighteen million five hundred thousand eggs have been shipped from Montreal to England since the opening of navigation That kept a good many Canadian hens busy"
"18911104","There was no representative of the Grand Trunk railway present. The Mayor explained briefly the object for the discussion of which the meeting had been called. Aid Frefontaine suggested that the question should be left over until the opinion of the City Attorney upon it had been obtained. Aid Stephens said that there was a gentleman named Mr. John Wood waiting for an opportunity to show the committee a model of a closed gate for railway crossings which he thought was well worthy the attention of the committee. He moved that he be heard. The Mayor thought the committee should wait until the City Attorney was heard from. The general of the aldermen present seemed to be in favor of the Mayor's suggestion. Aid Stephens, however, insisted that his motion should be put. The Mayor quietly and blandly requested him to be patient. Aid Stephens: ""Go on, go on, Mr. Mayor. We are not here for fooling."" Mayor McShane: ""I did not say that you were."" Aid Stephens: ""Will you put my motion? If you don't put my motion at once I will leave."" Nobody asked him to stay, so he rose, put on his overcoat and stalked slowly towards the door, evidently waiting for some of the aldermen present to call him back. Not one of them did, however, and he returned. As the City Attorney had not as yet put in an appearance, being detained by his duties in his office, the Mayor proposed that he should put the motion. This was agreed to and the motion was carried. Mr. Wood exhibited a plan of a level crossing closed gate, which he had himself invented. The principal feature in it was an ingenious contrivance through the operation of which, when the swing bar descends, another bar of equal length, about five feet below the former, or for that matter, any required number of feet falls also from the same iron lever pillar and, being attached to the swing bar by a number of gate rails, forms, when lowered, a sort of fence. ""Why, that's just the sort of gate which Aid Shorey proposed at the last meeting of the committee,"" said Aid Wilson. ""He didn't get it patented in time,"" though, remarked another. The City Surveyor on being asked his opinion, said that the joints of the lower bar were liable to freeze after a snowstorm, and to become unworkable. The gate would do well enough in summer. Mr. Spencer was invited to give his views, and he said that he had seen scores of similar models, but he had never seen any of them stand a practical test when erected. The snow in winter would render a gate of the kind suggested impracticable. The City Attorney entered the room at this moment. He said that he was not yet prepared to give his opinion on the proposed by-law. Its provisions raised the delicate point of constitutionality, involving as they did a conflict between the provincial Legislature and the Dominion Parliament. The Mayor: ""Will you be ready with your opinion on Friday, Mr. Hoy?"" The City Attorney: ""Yes."" Aid Thompson: ""The City Attorney's opinion is for the council, not for this committee."" The Mayor: ""I understand that."" Aid Stephens then moved a resolution in the following terms: ""That the by-law be sent back to the council, with a recommendation that it be passed by the council with such amendments as may appear necessary to the council, and that the City Attorney send his report to the council."" Aid made a lengthy speech, in which he proved, to his own satisfaction, that there was no necessity at all for asking the opinion of the City Attorney on the point; that it was for the Supreme Court to decide as to the constitutionality of the by-law; that under the general common law of the country, and under the city's charter, the council had the power to enforce the by-law, and that the question had gone beyond the point of constitutionality. This peculiar logic seemed to awe some of the aldermen, whose ideas had been rather mixed by the oratorical effort of Mr. Stephens. The Mayor, who thought that it was about time to put the motion, suggested that Aid Stephens had argued the question at sufficient length. Aid Stephens, with rising ire: ""Let me finish my remarks. You have a very bad habit of interrupting. You had better give it up or you will not be fit to hold your position as Mayor."" Mayor McShane: ""I am more fit to be Mayor than you are."" Aid Stephens: ""You never were fit to be Mayor. I have always said so."" Mayor McShane: ""Anyhow, you will never be Mayor."" Aid Stephens. Aid Thompson threw oil upon the troubled waters by demanding that the committee should get on with the business which it had met to transact. Aid Shorey then delivered a long address, without saying anything of importance. Aid Nolan enquired, when Mr. Shorey had finished, what the committee had met for. Aid Wilson explained the object for which the committee had been appointed, and in the course of his remarks he commented pointedly on the absence of a representative from the Grand Trunk railway. The Mayor said that it was the duty of the committee to draft a by-law on the subject of level crossing. Aid Conroy thought they should consider the question of forcing the railway companies to construct walkways wherever there at present existed level crossings. Aid Stephens said he was not prepared to go so far as that. His motion was then put and carried. Before the committee adjourned the Mayor thanked the members for the earnest and practical spirit in which they had performed their duties. City Hall Journal: The mortality of the city last week was 871 Catholics and 17 Protestants. A sub-committee of the Road committee is considering the question of taking measures to prevent the periodical flooding of upper St. Denis street by surface water from the fields around Cote St. Louis. Between October 15th and 31st, inclusive, the Board of Health vaccinators injected the lymph into 1,080 children. An anti-vaccinationist is to be prosecuted for refusing to allow his three children to undergo the operation. Last month the water consumption of the city amounted to 4,553,837 gallons, compared with 417,059,966 gallons in October of last year. The daily average of last month was consequently 14,695,185 gallons, compared with 19,610,613 in October, 1890. Arrangements have, it is understood, been made by the city with the Bank of Montreal for the provision of all the money it requires at present, regardless of any loan offered in Great Britain. Over half a million dollars are being paid out now on matured paper coupon bonds and interest. The bank has also agreed to carry an additional half million for the city, representing improvement advances by the city on which the collection rolls are not yet completed or served to the citizens."
"18911119","M. Courtney and Judge Huthridge, with the secretary, are expected to meet here shortly for the purpose of organizing and conducting work. The purpose of the commission is not to continue the investigation of scandals commenced by the Public Accounts committee, as some have supposed, but to examine into and report upon the workings of the several departments, and of the totals of the Senate and House of Commons. It is pointed out that a number of irregularities have gradually crept into the service, the number of persons employed in certain departments having increased out of all proportion to the increase of work, while in other departments some of the clerks are overworked and extra clerks have to be employed. The inquiries will be primarily as to the appointment, promotion, discipline and duties, including hours of attendance, extent of service and absence, salaries and remuneration. This will apply to both permanent and extra clerks, except as to remuneration, there being none for extras. The Departmental Inquiry As to the departments, the inquiries will be in the direction of the present organization, including the division and allotment of duties, the efficiency and sufficiency of the staff, the carrying on and supervision of the financial business of the departments, the system of purchase by the departments and the performance of extra work. Beyond this, the commissioners will have general authority to inquire into any other subject connected with the Civil Service which in their opinion requires consideration and readjustment in order to obtain the greatest efficiency. The commissioners are expected not only to point out defects, but to suggest remedies. The pay of the commissioners will be $10 per day, exclusive of travelling expenses, for George Zink and Edmond Sturbaum and the secretary, and $5 a day and travelling expenses to Judge Huthridge and Deputy Minister Courtney. The Remonstration at Perth Hon. John Hangart left for Perth to-night to attend the big meeting tomorrow. In the morning by the regular train Sir John Thompson and Hon. Messrs. Foster, Chisholm, Costigan and Howell will go up to the meeting, which will be held at 2:30. A return train for Ottawa will leave Perth at 10 o'clock. The Veterans A circular was issued by the Printing Bureau today to revising barristers that all communications respecting voters' lists be addressed to the Under Secretary of State and marked ""Franchise Act,"" instead of to the Queen's Printer. Mr. Dawson's title will be ""Queen's Printer and Stationery Distributor."" Loitering Yankee Fishermen As is usual about the close of the fishing season, a few American fishing vessels are still hanging about the fishing grounds, and they are being watched by the fisheries protection cutter Vigilant, which is the last of the protection fleet in commission, and which will go into winter quarters as soon as these American fishermen go home. Permission Granted at Once The Marine Department today received a telegram from Goderich asking permission to employ a tug to go to the assistance of a vessel which was ashore about three miles from town. The permission was at once granted. A great wind and snowstorm was reported as raging. General Capital Notes Mr. McKay, M"
"18911214","A hurricane swept over the camp at Allen Allen hot today and did a great deal of damage. So great was the force of the gale that the gable roof of the barrack was blown down and smashed to pieces. Every building on the grounds was more or less damaged. Fortunately the soldiers now at Allen were attending divine service when the storm broke upon the camp and no one is reported to have been injured. The church in which the service was being held withstood the fury of the gale. A terrific gale prevailed all day in the English Channel. The Cunard Auroral, from New York, which arrived at Liverpool this morning, was unable to stop at Queenstown on account of the gales. The gale, which has been accompanied by snow and heavy rain during Saturday and today, has done much damage throughout the country. Vessels in the English and Irish Channel have been obliged to run for shelter. Vessels arriving at Queenstown report terrible weather on the Atlantic. The steamship Wetherby, from Newport, November 18, which has been towed into Queenstown by the steamship MoGarel, had her shaft bent in a gale of December 4. Four days later the MoGarel commenced towing her, and while the latter was engaged at this work four hawsers were broken, the Wetherby herself was damaged before she arrived at Queenstown. Buildings have been unroofed at the Welsh seaport of Llanelli, and one David Bee was fatally injured by the roof above him falling while he was in bed. Along the Yorkshire coast there has been a severe snowstorm. Suspension of railway service owing to the snow is reported. Floods are reported in many parts of Derbyshire and many streets are under water in Matlock. In the Tees Valley damage amounting to thousands of dollars has been done by the high water, scores of cottages are flooded and a bridge has been partly demolished. There have been several narrow escapes from death. At Cambridge two girls were rushed beneath falling walls. One of them, named Kate Foster, was killed outright, the other injured and in a critical condition. Terrible Ravages, London, December 14. Reports of the ravages of influenza in various parts of Europe are being constantly received. At Perpignan, France, twenty of the twenty-two nuns occupying the convent of St. Claire were prostrated with the disease. When the nuns finally consented to admit outsiders who for several days had vainly sought to offer them assistance, it was found that the poor women were in a starving condition, the only remaining food consisting of a small quantity of dried beans. Proper food and medical attendance were promptly supplied and the sufferers are now rapidly recovering. At Hamburg 2,000 cases of influenza have been reported during the past week and the death toll has not diminished. The famous pianist, Von Bulow, is a victim of the disease and is in a critical condition. Graceful Anglican Church Scene, Dublin, December 13. St. Mary’s church, in Newry, a Protestant-Anglican place of worship, was today the scene of a very disorderly occurrence. While services were going on eleven velvety men advanced to the altar and seized the communion cloth, on which were embroidered the letters, ""I"
"18911219","A POLAR BEAR deck to see a noise camera and took a views of the ice pack, and one of our crew. The ice views have turned out very meaningless, but the crews form a fair picture. The 23rd July closed very dark and wet, with a strong gale of wind, which soon brought down a heavy fog. Soon after midnight the ice turned the ship's head round towards Resolution, nor could they turn her back for the ice, which was rearing up and creating in the gale. Some actually fell on the deck. At 3:30 the ice broke our extra rudder tackle, and while they were fixing it, the captain suddenly exclaimed: ""There's the land close to us."" Through a temporary rift in the fog, they saw that we were close on a lee shore, whither the gale and the tide must have carried us, and we were driving along it at a rapid rate. I could hardly have believed that I could sleep through such a gale, and shouting and crashing of ice, and tramping on the poop deck thirty inches above my head, yet so it was. At four o'clock the captain was nearly calling me to dress and be ready in case we struck the rocks. At 5:30 I awoke, heard the noise, was aware that something seemed wrong, and tried to go to sleep again, but in vain. Soon the mate was sent to tell me to get up if I wanted something to photograph. A NARROW ISLAND. Coming on deck I found the prospect rather startling; the fog had lifted, and there, not a quarter of a mile away, was the rock-bound, barren, uninhabited Resolution, presenting a series of small bare coves, between points which reached well out towards us; while we were hemmed in by surging ice, which helped to keep us off the shore, on which the wind was forcing us. The tide was meanwhile carrying us and the ice past point after point westward, getting gradually nearer the shore. For the ship, presenting so much more surface to the wind than the ice did, was gradually forced through the ice between us and the shore, though we had two ice anchors and two grappling irons out, and made fast to any suitable pieces. All the officers and men of both watches were at work at this and with the rudder, from 4 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., with no thought of sleep and little of food, and of course I took a hand along with them. But the ice kept breaking away from our irons; we lost one anchor and one rope parted; our rudder, with four men to hold it, got squeezed by the ice, and the rudder-head cracked; you could hear the rending of the fibers of the wood all over the ship. AFTER SEVEN MILES or so of this westward drift, the tide turned (it was full moon and raging spring tide), and we retraced our perilous course, being carried eastward till we had passed the point where we first saw the land and now we were not 200 miles from the projecting capes. I can truly say that I felt no fear, only anxiety, mixed with a lot of vexation at the thought of spending months on such land. I wondered if we should save the provisions; what a winter there would be like or whether we should be able, a month or two later, to get in the boat across to L'Agavabay and the Labrador Eskimos; and, if not, how we should ever make our locality known. But though there seemed little chance of escaping wreck, yet I seemed to feel sure that God would enable us to escape it in answer to the many prayers that were being offered for us by friends. Just at noon our state seemed at its worst, yet another was at hand. We were well into sight, drifting towards a far projection; all our lines had been hauled on board, their hold having failed; there was little or no ice to fend us from the shore; all our sails were furled to offer least resistance to the wind; when the wind suddenly changed a little, and the ice began to open. Orders were shouted; we all ran to our places at the different ropes: sail after sail was set in a twinkling; the ship once more was able to get steerage way; and we stood away just in time to avoid the point. Then the weather cleared, the sun shone, the ice opened more and more, and with occasional use of the grappling iron we at length gained clear water, and one was sent below for rest and dinner at 2 p.m. The ship was once more just where she had been three days before, and we found that the shore which had so long threatened us was Hutton's Head, Resolution Island. Near evening, at a short prayer service in the forecastle, thanksgiving was offered to God for our delivery and Psalm 107:21-31 was read. THE MIRAGE. The next day, bright and cold, with contrary wind, we lay to in an open pond, while the damaged tackle was repaired and the strained rudder head tinkered up. That evening we had our first light of what was an almost daily and continuous spectacle throughout the Straits and in the bay, a mirage. Distant land, loch-like, was seen on or just above the horizon, inverted and resting on or just above the real object, which was often below the horizon, making it impossible to tell the real horizon, so that the captain could rarely be more than a few miles off his own. While the endless procession of ice moved slowly past us, though we had few square miles of open water, on Monday afternoon, 20th July, after a beautiful morning, during which we lay becalmed on a perfect mirror and baked in a summer sun, an east wind came and again we started. But so did the ice, and after two or three miles of open water, just opposite our old enemy, Hutton's Head, the ice was closing us in towards the shore. So choosing the most broken looking spit, the captain put her into it, and we crept along northwest, as the mountains first looked, sometimes turned round, but by grappling the ice getting right again. That continued all night, and next morning found us in thick fog packed fast in ice which seemed quite still. About 10 a.m., the whole field, with a roaring and splintering, began to crowd on us from the south, like a crescent-shaped charge of cavalry on a devoted infantry square, and carried us for twenty minutes towards the land again, when all suddenly stopped. There we lay nearly twenty-four hours. It was mid-summer! Yet we had a pretty heavy snowstorm, and many nights it froze hard. The next day was much the same, fog jammed fast, less fog and ice around, during which we crept a few miles further then escape. Were it not for the delay and the anxiety, much of the sailing would have been delightful, as if in fairy land."
"18911225","D' was also conferred upon him by an American university. Those who listened to him felt that they were listening to a man who had a large store of knowledge at his command. He was able to do his own thinking, and so used the powers at his disposal. In public life he was a Christian socialist and reformer. He was also an eloquent advocate of temperance. His great forte was the pulpit. This was his joy, and he made diligent preparation for his sermons, and what at times might appear spontaneous was the result of patient forethought. He returned to Hamilton on the 26th and gradually became weaker. No one, however, anticipated that the end was so near; but he appears to have himself felt the conviction that the end was at hand. He remarked: ""I am one that dwells on the mountain tops; but if they only knew the rapture I feel now."" He asked: ""Where is Dr. Johnston, for he promised to be with me when I died and to read to me the twenty-third psalm?"" This was read to him, and the hymn, ""Jesus, lover of my soul,"" was sung, in which he endeavored to join. The slight vein of eccentricity was rather a help than a drawback. His last sickness stole upon him gradually. His conscientious attention to duty was evidenced by the fact that in fifty years he never failed in keeping his Sabbath appointments. The last time he appeared before his congregation, he was really unfit for the work and rose on Sunday morning from his sick bed to undertake the service, and in the evening preached what proved to be his last sermon. The subject of this sermon was ""Glorifying God."" Shortly afterwards he fell into a comatose state and at 3 P.M. died. Several other ministers spoke in similar strains. After the first prayer the congregation lapsed before the bier and took a last farewell. The casket was then carried out of the church, placed in the waiting hearse, and the journey to the grave commenced. Today, Friday, being Christmas Day, the offices of the Post and the receiving houses will be closed at 10 a.m. The outgoing afternoon mail will be closed at 10 a.m., and the night mails at the usual hour. CHRISTMAS IN HOSPITAL Something About the Decorations at the General Hospital. Night after night for the past year a Gazette reporter has visited the General Hospital in search of news for his paper's readers in the morning. Of course, in time all spots become familiar, and so in this case; the doors were well known to the writer, and the same may be said of the interior. But last night what a change! Outside an incipient snowstorm was endeavoring to cover the dirty streets with its white flakes, but with little success; inside there was a great change. The moment the door was opened the welcome sight of holly and evergreens, entwined around the pillars, walls and portico greeted the eye. Then it could be easily seen that although there were many poor sufferers inside, everyone, from the fireman who helps to keep the building warm with his sturdy arms, which throw more fuel in the fiery furnaces, past doorkeepers, nurses and doctors up to the governors, had made up their minds to make it as pleasant as possible for all in the institution. The lobby was well decorated. Upstairs the busy nurses, in their pink dresses and white caps, with happy smiles on their faces, were going from point to point in the different wards, adding a touch here and there to the decorations, all the time followed by the eyes of the patients, who smiled approvingly, albeit each smile in some instances caused a pang of pain. There it was that the true and full beauty of the work of good and willing hands burst on the visitor, not so much on the eye, but on the heart, and if the benefactors who have passed away are permitted to look down from above, they can only say: Thanks, true and faithful servants who are left. Of course, the great point of interest was the ward of the little ones, where a scene burst on one that almost brought tears to the eyes. Nineteen babies lay, either in cots, cradles or bassinets, and as they lay they gazed with delight on two huge Christmas trees that fairly groaned with presents for the little sufferers. Towering high towards the ceiling, the trees looked fine. There were dolls for girls, drums for boys and candy and fruit galore. Nurses Annaud, Chipman and Gold, who have charge of this work, did not finish here with their efforts to please their little patients, as across the ward, on the wall, was a motto that spoke to all hearts: ""Unto us a child is born,"" which was prettily bordered with evergreens and paper roses. The remainder of the ward was also nicely decorated, for which the nurses deserve credit. A look at the patients showed that they appreciated the efforts put forth for their pleasure. All were smiling that were able, some, true, in sleep, but nevertheless, they were smiling. One tot of a boy about six called out ""Harry"" as the reporter was leaving the ward and wished him a merry Christmas, which was returned with heartfelt wishes for the little sufferer's speedy recovery. The next ward visited was No. 24, which Nurses Foster, Jackson, Anderson and Sutherland had decorated in a splendid manner. Over the door, wreathed in evergreens, was the word ""Welcome,"" which inside the motto, ""We cure all ills but those of love,"" greeted the visitors. Ward 30, which is a female ward, was also profuse in its decorations, which were put up under the supervision of Nurses Jolly and Bolster. Wreaths, crosses, mottos and streamers predominated, as they also did in Ward 32. Passing round the stairway, Ward 31 was reached. Here Nurses Bush, Enyon, Fraser and Collins had placed hundreds of paper roses and evergreens around the pillars and walls. The flag and insignia of those that have been seen on many a battlefield and on errands of mercy in time of flood, fire, or famine, the Geneva Cross, was on the walls, flanked by that of St. George, while above was a motto in course of completion. In Ward 33, a men's ward, Nurses Holliday and Seaton had stretched streamers from wall to wall and had placed evergreens and holly around the sides. Here a doctor was examining a patient, after which he hurried to another and asked how he was. The man replied: ""A little better."" ""That's right,"" said the doctor. ""We want you to feel all right tomorrow, Christmas, you know, my man."" Ward 21, also a male ward, was a scene of brightness that was a pleasure to the eye. Streamers of purple and white, together with Chinese lanterns predominated, and Nurses Prime, May and Goodhue ought to feel proud of their efforts. Ward 23, the next visited, had been very prettily decorated in yellow and white by Nurse McGregor; while in Ward 11 Nurses Cashen, Mercler and Sims had excelled themselves by the tasteful manner in which the ward was decorated. As the hour was getting late, none of the other wards were visited, but all had been decorated. A visit was paid to Steward Bates' office, where it was ascertained that everything that could be given the patients with safety would be allowed today. The trees in the children's ward will not be stripped of their store of happy gifts until tomorrow evening, when the little ones will crow with delight over the good things given them by kind and willing hearts.

"18920108","On December 21st it became an international question, crossing the boundary and being entered in the customs at Winnipeg. Winnipeg was a good town to the hat. Everybody was glad to see it, and everybody contributed a tag to its superabundance of tags. It spent Christmas Day in Winnipeg, and somebody either made it a Christmas present to the bear or gave the bear to it. At any rate, they became sworn friends, and when the hat left Winnipeg, the bear had concluded to go along with it. They had a short stay in Toronto, while the hat had several calls from newspaper friends. Then it got to Ottawa, the hoped-for destination of its Sioux City friend. Parliament was not sitting, but New Year's Day came along to brighten up the aspect of things generally, and from reading the tags one would judge that the hat had the gayest time of its life in the capital city. It again made friends with the press, and its influence was so great that it secured a recess pass to the House of Commons reading room for its friend the bear. But its destiny was not to remain in Ottawa, and so it came to pass that it reached Montreal yesterday morning, along with the biggest snowstorm of the season. Its stay here has been made as pleasant as possible, and a number of tags were added to its already existing five hundred. The little bear has had gifts showered upon him by the score, and the cold weather has been provided for by the gift of a pair of gloves, while there is some talk of getting him a pair of moccasins. The hat and its friend will leave here this evening for Quebec, and then go down to St. John and Halifax, and then take a trip over to Newfoundland. When it gets back it will take in Boston and New York, after which it will do the Southern States. It has traveled a good many thousand miles already, been as far east as Montreal, as far west as San Francisco, as far south as New Orleans, and as far north as Winnipeg, and is still traveling."
"18920109","JAE, M' - m Feb March May 6 42 6 66 6 42 6 65 Messrs Schwartz, Dupee & McCormick, of Chicago, telegraph Oswald Bros, 13 and as Hospital street, as follows: Wheat opened very weak, declined sharply, but milled and closed at about last night's price. May sold between 92 to 93 and closed 93. Cables to-day showed more decisively than they did Thursday the effect of our big Government total and of the collapse in price here. Every foreign market showed a sharp decline. The fact that trade at large, most all day was in the way of liquidation was rather unpromising for a substantial permanent reaction. The two big short lines in the market were very considerably reduced. The trader whose line has been the notable one for several months says his short interest now is comparatively small. Export clearances were only moderate of wheat, but large of flour. Minneapolis reported a sale of sixty thousand barrels of flour for export. Master receipts were still light. The seaboard reported a fair amount of new engagements made. A little business was done here, all mill. Corn was firm, a noteworthy circumstance considering the weakness in wheat. May sold from 41 to 41.5, closed 41. Experts were about 600,000 bushels from the Atlantic ports. Receipts were lightest for any recent day, including only six cars of contract. Oats firm, but dull. The shippers have taken the hog market out of the hands of the packers and, in spite of receipts of 7,000 over estimates, advanced prices 15 to 20. The result was a very strong provision market, with shorts covering freely and many packers, as well as outside trade, buying for long account. The estimate of hogs (26,000) for tomorrow is large, but produced no effect on the market, which continued strong, closing at the top. The feeling is becoming general that prices may advance still higher. I win, Green & Co's Chicago special to the Gazette says: Wheat was weak and lower early with considerable selling by miscellaneous longs, but the amount of such dumpings was not so large as expected, and seemed readily absorbed. Trade was broad and active, and although cables were, naturally enough, dull and depressed, a firmer undertone was evident in the latter part of the session, and the closing prices were about the highest. New York cleared 300,000 bushels, and as much more was shipped from other ports. Ten loads were worked last night and 15 today while 24,000 bushels were bought here for Liverpool to go to the seaboard, all rail. These facts induced some local short covering and encouraged a little cautious long investment, but the market is still feeble and liable to relapse. Corn was dull and colorless and the local market, though with firm foundation in good shipping demand, the wants exceed the ability of shippers to satisfy, although all but two or three roads are now taking eastern shipments. Pork was very active and spectacularly strong, closing at $11.80 for May. Hops were high, but the rapid advance seemed due to very light offerings and the demand for meats by shippers; shorts, too, were hungry for pork, and the pit was the scene of old-time activity all day. The New York wheat market closed steady at $1.02 January, $1.03 February, $1.04 March, $1.04 May, $1.03 June, $1.01 July. Corn closed at 61c January, 62c February, 61c March, 61c April, 60c May, and oats at 36c January, 37c February, 37c May. At St. Louis wheat closed at 89c cash, 90c January, 89c February, 93c May, 92c July. Corn closed at 37c cash, 36c January, 38c February, 39c May, and oats at 31c cash, 31c January, 31c May. At Toledo wheat closed steady at 93c cash, 93c January, 88c May. Corn and oats closed quiet at 41c oats, 42c May and 39c cash. At Duluth No. 1 hard closed at 80c cash, 80c January, 82c May, and No. 1 Northern at 58c cash, 58c January, 81c May. At Milwaukee wheat closed at 82c January, 80c May.

At Minneapolis the receipts were 236,000 wheat, and the shipments 80,000. At Duluth the receipts were 9,000 wheat, and the shipments nil. Provision. The local provision market remains quiet. Pork is moving slowly at easy prices and lard is neglected. Canadian short ribs, per bbl, $14.79 to $15.00. Mess pork, western, per bbl, $11.00 to $14.00.

The Chicago provision market was strong today, the closing prices being as follows: Pork, $10.86 January, $11.80 May; Lard, $9.66 May. At Liverpool today provisions were as follows: Pork, 48s 3d; lard, 32s 0d; bacon, 32s; tallow, 20s 3d. The Chicago hog market was 6 to 10 cents higher today, closing at the following: Light mixed, $3.85 to $4.20; mixed packing, $3.86 to $4.15; heavy shipping, $3.85 to $4.20; rough grades, $3.85 to $3.95. The estimated receipts were 36,000, compared with yesterday's official 62,838. There were 16,301 shipped and about 10,000 left over. The cattle market was firm; receipts, 8,000. Produce. There is no change in the cheese market, the same firm feeling being apparent. We quote little. The Liverpool cable is unchanged at 11s. The butter market is quiet. There is not much doing locally and while there is still good inquiry for Western for export, no business is reported owing to the high ideas of holders. The market made creamery, 20 to 24. Finest Townships, 20 to 20.5. Finest Western, 4 to 17. There was a better demand for eggs today at 15 to 16 cents, the market ruling steady with a strong undertone. The continued low prices and good quality of the stock have had the effect of keeping up a good average consumption for the last few months. There was a brisk demand for all fresh, dry picked poultry today, with the exception perhaps of geese and old fowls, which are in oversupply. Turkeys sold well at 9 to 10 cents, choice stock being scarce. Choice chickens were also in small supply, all offerings selling freely at 7 to 8 cents. Ducks were in good demand at 9 cents, but geese sold slowly at 3 to 6 cents. Fowls were also slow at 8 to 7 cents. Partridges continue to move out freely on arrival at 30 to 35 cents per brace for firsts, and 20 to 25 cents for seconds. Daily Receipts.

The Sultan gave audience to the French ambassador yesterday. In the course of the interview the Sultan said he thought it right to keep the letter and spirit of the compact made with Egypt by Abdul Aziz. It had been agreed, he said, that Egypt should be independent, and he was not going to quibble about this subject, but by plain fair dealing he was going to avoid a dangerous responsibility. He consented, therefore, that Abbas Pasha should succeed his father. Vjbnna, January 11 The Nieu Freit Lretic says Egypt's present situation of affairs requires the extension of British occupation of the country, adding: The Parisians deceive themselves in thinking the present occasion opportune to raise the question of British evacuation. Pahis, January 11 The Soltil lays: France being alone in opposition to England, and M. do Freyoinet having presided over the Cabinet which allowed England to enter Egypt alone, it is more than probable that the Government will do nothing whatever with regard to Egypt, especially as Turkey is certain to back out of any difficulty. Slave Dealer Under the Union Jack London, January 11 Mr. Varley, a social burst, who has recently visited Singapore, has written to Lord Salisbury charging the Government with permitting a horrible traffic in Chinese coolies to be carried on in Singapore. He says these coolies are drafted by thousands, almost naked, and thrust into large receiving sheds in Singapore by agents commonly called slave dealers, where they are reshipped by English steamers to Java, Sumatra, Corneo and other countries and led out by agents to a system of enforced labor, where they have no voice concerning their position, work or pay. Another Insurrection In Yemen Aden, January 11 The Arab insurrection in Yemen has been renewed. The insurgents are under the leadership of Ahmad Adin, a descendant of the former rulers of Yemen. The rebels are marching upon Banna, the capital city of Yemen, and the Turkish forces are advancing to repulse them. The sheikhs with their followers are rising everywhere against the Turkish authorities. The telegraph wires between Sanaa and Hodia have been cut. Making up With Italy Eomhi, January 11 It is again reported that the negotiations between Italy and the United States for the re-establishment of friendly relations are making progress. It is said that the negotiations have taken place at Rome and that the affair may be expected to be completed soon.

"18920116","C May meeting, except that it has become generally known that horse owners are to be propitiated with a five days' meeting. It could hardly be worth while for American horses to come here for less, and if there was some meeting to go on to from Toronto, more might be induced to come over. Last year some few came on here from Buffalo, but reports say there is to be no meeting there this spring. Toronto, therefore, has to depend upon its own powers of attraction, and no doubt will bear in mind that the early closing of entries will be greatly against the coming of American horses, whose absence would rob the meeting of half its interest and prestige. Toronto has to choose now between the insignificance of a local meeting and the gradual institution of prizes valuable enough to attract horses of nearly the first class from the neighboring republic. A broad, bold, unselfish policy may be expected from those who have the enterprise in hand, and it should be their endeavor to get every horse they can to compete at what promises to be even a more successful meeting than that of 1891. Where Sockless Jerry Heared. Jerry Simpson is not the hayseed that he is represented to be by some of the daily prints. He dresses neatly and has the appearance of a keen-eyed businessman. He is called ""Sockless Jerry,"" but he declares that since reaching man's estate he has never worn shoes without socks. He is a fluent talker, and the trouble with him is that he does not know when to stop. At the Alabama State Fair he was advertised to stand on a platform with Senator Peffer and deliver a speech. At this platform was in the grand stand, and directly opposite the judges' stand, Mr. Simpson was advised to cut it short, so that the racing program might be finished before dark. Senator Peffer spoke briefly, keeping his eyes on his watch, and then Mr. Simpson began to unwind himself. He tickled the Alabama farmers and took no note of time. At 2:30 o'clock the horses were on the track and ready to score. David Bonner, presiding judge, did not like to be discounted, but since Mr. Simpson would not stop, there was no help for it. The bell was sharply rung, and it drowned for a space of one minute the voice of Mr. Simpson. The senator passed with a smile on his face, then calmly proceeded with his speech. The horses scored and finally got the word. The orator kept at it until the quarter pole was in sight, and then, as his hearers rose to their feet and grew excited over the shifting of positions of the contestants, Mr. Simpson rounded a period and stopped. He watched the finish of the heat with some interest, and then was lost in the throng. That evening, at the dinner table, Mr. Bonner apologized for his seeming rudeness, but Mr. Simpson good-naturedly stopped him, ""No explanation is necessary. My time was up and I knew it. I simply wanted to see how long I could hold an Alabama audience against the race bell. I have frequently made the experiment in other states and now I am satisfied that there is nothing more moving than a horse trot."" As Mr. Simpson spent his younger days in Cleveland and Chicago, he learned a good deal about the light harness horses before settling down in Kansas. Turf, Field and Farm.

Prince Howard, 107 Graduate, 101 Hiawatha, 102 Beat pair, Marie Lovell, Xenophon. THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 16, 1892. A JOURNEY SOUTHWEST, From St. Louis to the Mexican Frontier. I descended the canyons of the mountains. As the morning sun rose, I looked out of the car window in the gray dullness of the morning and caught my first glimpse by daylight of the turbid waters of the Mississippi. We were crossing the famous railway bridge, a fine structure, indeed, but one that I cordially hated before we were halfway over. ""It's one of the grand landmarks of our country,"" said a stout gentleman near me, ""and indeed, I may say of the world, for it can't be beaten anywhere,"" and forthwith he deluged me with figures. The bridge was too long, had too many arches, cost too much, had paid for itself too many times over, etc. I longed to annihilate him with similar figures about the Victoria Bridge and the Canadian Pacific Railway bridge at Lachine, but for the life of me I could not remember a single fact respecting these engineering triumphs. I mentally, however, registered a vow never again to travel in the United States without a book of Canadian statistics. I think everyone's first impression of St. Louis must be that it is the dirtiest, grimmest place one could set foot in, especially in the days of early winter. The sun seems to shine yellowly through the thick mist of smoke which hangs over the city, particularly the business portion. This latter reminded me very much of Chicago; indeed, the bridge appears to be the only distinguishing feature about St. Louis. But one thing struck me, and that was the pleasant, unhurried appearance of the people I saw on the streets; they seemed to take to enjoy life, not to gallop through it as their brethren of the rival city do. Out in the wide streets of the west end, the smoke is less noticeable and in the beautiful forest park extending over more than 1,300 acres of wooded country, with pretty drives, winding walks, flowers, etc., the atmosphere is pure and sweet. This must be a grand place for the poor in summer, as there are electric and cable cars running to it from all parts of the city. The fact that the Southern Hotel was the finest hotel in the West had been dinned into my ears so frequently in my travels through the Western States that I was prepared to be disappointed in it, but it was equal to its reputation, and I left it regretfully to once more take up my temporary abode in a Pullman, this time on the Iron Mountain Road bound for El Paso, Texas. THE IRON MOUNTAIN ROAD is a part of the great Missouri Pacific system, which operates upwards of 6,000 miles and is one of the fastest and most comfortable lines to travel by in the West. This particular branch is so-called from an Iron Mountain in Missouri, which we passed in the night so that I had no opportunity of seeing it. It was the first time I had traveled by this route, and when I awakened in the morning I lay for some time with closed eyes, dreading to raise the curtains of my berth. We had entered the State of Arkansas and I expected to see again the same drear, level brown prairie country diversified only by cactus, plumb, sagebrush, and greasewood, which my former experience of the southwest had taught me to believe was the only scenery to be found here. But when at last I summoned up courage to gaze out on the landscape, what a surprise met my eyes! Instead of uninteresting prairie, there was a blaze of crimson and yellow glory; we were whirling through a rich forest country. The rain was coming down in slow, elastic sheets, but seen athwart these masses of coloring, each drop shone like a living jewel and added its luster to the general brilliancy. All day long we rode southwest across the state, through this lovely wooded country. It was so beautiful in its pink and golden coloring, with here and there a dash of green, the trees growing so close to the railroad that oftentimes the swaying branches brushed the car windows; silent, for there was not a sign of any living creature, that it seemed as if we were passing through some enchanted land, and even the train appeared to feel the spell and hush its noisy rattling. Now and then we passed a pretty arched pathway leading away through the shining yellow loveliness, or a tiny streamlet flowing noiselessly. Once only there was any sound to break the stillness. The rain had ceased, the air was warm and balmy, and through the opened window we heard one single loud cry from some passing bird. ""That bird squeals because it's dead,"" said a baby voice from the end of the car. Sometimes the train stopped at a little village in a narrow clearing, then plunged again directly into the woods. Beautiful as this country is to look upon, however, it does not appear to be very prosperous. These villages are poor and unkempt with tumble-down houses and generally crowds of darkies lounging around the station or leaning propped up against the bales of cotton ready for shipment. At each station, there are two waiting rooms with ""For Colored People"" above one of them. There is also a car attached to our train for negroes exclusively. ""These villages look miserably poor,"" I said to the conductor. ""Yes, ma'am,"" he answered, ""and they are as poor as they look; dirt floors are good enough for most of them."" Occasionally we passed a sawmill hedged in by the flaming forest, but the buildings appeared to be always either in process of construction or destruction. ""I don't think I saw a whole one once, though there were numerous piles of fresh sawn lumber."" We caught many a glimpse of brown fields of cotton flecked with white where the ungathered cotton showed through the bursting bolls. Sometimes the pretty pink blossoms were growing side by side with the ripened cotton; sometimes whole fields were pink with flowers showing daintily from out the dried brown leaves from which the cotton had already been gathered. We passed the White River, green as an emerald, though called white, flowing silently and tortuously through the peaceful woods and reflecting all the brave show of colors on its placid bosom. It is called a large river here, and the conductor told me that it is navigable for over a hundred miles. It looked to me scarcely large enough to float a good-sized punt. Here we crossed the Arkansas, muddy and shallow, as I had seen it last, hundreds of miles away, in the mountains of Colorado, but there it tumbled tumultuously through narrow gorges; here it flowed slowly and contentedly as if rejoicing that its long journey was nearly over. We passed Little Rock, the capital of Arkansas, a prosperous little town apparently, situated high on some rising bluffs. Then we plunged again into the silent woods, now darkening with the shades of night, but ever beautiful. The next morning we were rolling due west across Texas, and we had to try what the Texans call a ""Norther,"" and a norther is by no manner of means a pleasant thing to encounter. How the wind whistled through and around the car; sometimes it seemed as if it would blow the train off the track, and it was icy cold. Towards the afternoon, we got out of its sweep, and the sun shone down hotly. No more golden forest now, only dull prairie, broken now and then by a field of cotton with the pickers at work in it. The stopping places now are few and far between. The only places of importance, Dallas and Fort Worth, not far from each other, each equally dry and uninteresting as seen from the car window. We crossed the Brazos River, thick red from the soil through which it flows, and very shallow, but sometimes we meet a long string of prairie schooners, their canvas covers flapping in the wind. Now and then we see a lonely tramp, his blanket slung across his shoulder, head bent down, trudging doggedly on with the sublime capability of a tramp for doing anything but work. Now we see another, sheltering himself from the heat of the noonday sun as he lies at full length on the dusty plain beneath the gray shade of a tall yucca. These tramps are to me one of the saddest features of these vast, desolate prairies. You see hundreds of them every year, following generally the lines of some railroad. Their blankets, which form their only shelter at night, are strapped to their shoulders. Many a one has lain down weary and exhausted when night has fallen, alone on the wide plains beneath the silent stars, never to rise again; dead, alone there, a nameless waif. Perhaps in some far-off home, across the seas it may be, a gray-haired mother has prayed for this black sheep, her boy still. And surely the Great Father of all, remembering these prairies, will look in pitying forgiveness on that cold white face with wide unseeing eyes raised to the pure sky, only a tramp. Texas is a great state as far as extent of territory goes at any rate. We travel all night, all day, another night, and it is noon of the second day before we reach its western boundary where the Rio Grande separates it from Mexico. Here the country becomes mountainous, gray and entirely devoid of verdure except where there is irrigation. The mountains rise tall and sharply defined against the intense blue of the sky, unbeautiful in their gray barrenness save where the purple shadows soften their rugged outlines. Sierra Blanca! How pretty the Spanish name sounds, but there is nothing pretty about the mountains in the dazzling morning sunlight save its name. It is not even white, only dull dust color. Surely the Spanish caballero who named it saw it first after one of the rare snowstorms and so endowed it forever with the poetry of that storm. There is a station, too, called Sierra Blanca; no village, nothing but the wooden station standing solitary on the wide plain, surrounded by tall yucca and cactus bush. HOLDING A CLAIM. A woman was at the station selling baskets of cactus plants and ""stem previve,"" a queer dried-up looking plant which grows on the mountains of Texas and Mexico, and, as its name indicates, lives always. She offered me some. ""Perhaps when I am returning in the spring,"" I answered. ""In the spring,"" she said, looking up eagerly, ""I shall not be here."" She was dressed in a scanty skirt and a faded shawl, and wore on her head an old felt hat. She appeared to be a woman of fifty, perhaps more, but her face was so brown and seamed and hardened from constant exposure to the scorching sun and ceaseless winds that it was difficult to tell her age. ""I'm holding a claim here,"" she continued, ""yonder in them hills,"" pointing vaguely to the gray mountains, ""and the land'll be mine in March."" I looked around; there was no sign of any habitation, nothing but barren plains and bleak hills, everything gray, a desolate mass of greyness beneath the blazing sun. Her eyes followed the woman's pointing finger. Far up against the mountainside, I could see a small dark object. ""That's my house. I've got a good-sized claim up in it."" ""Do you live all alone there?"" ""Yes, ma'am, I ain't scared,"" with a deft movement of her right arm she raised her shawl and showed a stout pistol. ""But it must be very lonely?"" ""Yes, ma'am, it is powerful lonely, especially in wintertime, but I've gotten used to it and the wind's kind of company. I’ve stood it too long; I guess I can stand it to the end of my three years."" ""Did you have to pay for that land?"" ""Yes, ma'am, and dear, too."" ""Surely you could have found better land than that and in a less lonely spot?"" I looked at the dry barren soil from which it seemed impossible that any good could spring, and I thought of our own broad fertile acres in the Northwest to be had for almost the asking. ""I wouldn't give this up for no sum."" Her faded eyes lighted suddenly with an unnatural brilliancy. She came close to me and whispered in my ear, ""There's gold in them mountains."" ""How do you know?"" ""Because they've been trying so hard to get it away from me. Them mining fellows have been after me time and again to sell it to them, but they'll not get it from me. I'll hold on to it as long as there is a drop of blood in my body, and you'd better believe I'll have that gold yet."" ""All aboard,"" called out the conductor, and I left her, but I stood on the end of the car watching the gray hills until they were out of sight, and I wondered much."

A woman named Moreau, aged 82, died in jail this morning. Fireman John O'Connell died last night of the grip and all the stations are draped in black today. The coroner held an inquest yesterday on the body of Henrietta Couture, aged 63, who died suddenly on Friday. She was living with Francois Gosledin and his wife. Gosledin died of the grip on Thursday and this so affected Miss Couture that she died the following day. A verdict of death from heart disease was returned. There was a slight collision on the Intercolonial Railway at Chatham Junction this morning. A freight train had been shunted onto a siding, but the rear car was left partly on the main track and the express train struck it, taking off the wheels, but doing no material damage. The trains were blocked for four hours.

"18920126","BRITISH CATTLE MARKETS Choice Descriptions of Cattle Making Some Money Freights Too High to Make Home Profits Mutton Weak Under Heavy Supplies (Special correspondence to the GAZETTE, Liverpool, January 18) Market this week has as a rule been firmer for cattle, and choice descriptions have been making more money, for secondary classes a quicker selling trade is all that can be reported. On the other hand, mutton has dropped in value considerably, retailers finding the demand run to roast beef when anything like a cold snap of weather happens along. And we have had it cold now, frost, fog, hail and rain, all at once or, at least, all in one day. The snowstorm at the beginning of the week was pretty severe while it lasted, and in the country districts great wreaths of snow are yet to be found. In our larger cities the snow speedily becomes mere slush and mud, some little interruption to traffic occurred in the North of Scotland and Wales, but not enough to keep stock in transit out of the markets more than a few hours, or half a day at the most. Locally the supplies have been well maintained from Ireland, and from America the arrivals are rather over the average. The demand has, however, been steady for cattle and business a bit brisker with core money current. At Birkenhead, good United cattle dressing say 740 to 760 lbs of beef is very near 7d, the bodies realizing 6d. They were good cattle, however, and worth all that was given for them. As a general quotation for mixed shipments 6jd would be top figure. On Monday last salesmen were glad to make 6d, but when the wires began to pour in from London asking prices, and the boys here learned there were only 370 cattle at Deptford, it made them put the rates up right away. Whether this activity will hold any time, all depends on the weather, and as at present writing it is as cold and bitter as at any time during the week, it looks a bit encouraging. The American shipper wants a turn badly just now, but whenever it seems to shape the right way, up goes the freights again. Just now they are paying 9s, and I learned that 60s was the rate at which space had been taken for February. Let them go ahead at 60s, perhaps they will get sick of it and quit the business, and allow our Canadian shippers a look in later on. Mutton has dropped fully one penny per pound this week, the weak demand and heavy supplies forced on the market knocking values down all at once. The enormous stock of frozen mutton which have been accumulating in the cold stores, in anticipation of big prices, are now being let go at any prices, and this has also contributed to accelerate the rapid fall. Many flock-masters, fearing the shortage of fodder consequent upon a hard winter, rushed out all the sheep they could, and I believe the loss resulting therefrom will be very heavy."

Heavy Failure of Dealers, St. Louis, Mo, February 5 ""OT GAZETTE MONTREAL! SATURDAY FEBRUARY C U: COW BELLS, P. M. Mutilated Text, I had been overworked and found rest in a quiet New England village, because of an old friendship. Due to forty past years, I found Oliver Austin, still the guileless Oliver of my boyhood, willing to spend with me every hour not devoted to his clerical duties. I was met by him on the stone bridge which spans the village stream. The shallow river makes a loop here, running through the flat lands, and here came the cows from the woody slopes, leisurely munching the tender grass. I heard the pleasing tinkle of the cowbells, and to me there is no sweeter music. ""Oliver,"" said I, ""to a tired man no sound is so mellow-toned as the one a cowbell gives. This is a Sabbath rest to me, as consoling as was your sermon yesterday."" Had I unwittingly touched on a topic painful to the pastor? Oliver was trembling. ""What have I done?"" I cried alarmed. I took his hand in mine. ""Do you remember in that busy life of yours to have, at my request, looked over a patent claim I sent to you?"" he asked. ""I have hundreds of such in the year, I try to forget them. In your case I did not, for in thirty years you may have honored me with a half dozen letters. Of course, I recall it. I have a mechanical trick of remembering when I want to. Name of party, Gaines, but what the claim exactly was escapes me. What has that to do with your trouble? Can I do anything in a legal way?"" ""It is past your cure. God alone can save,"" said Oliver Austin solemnly. Then, seated on the bridge, he told me his story. ""Yep, Gaines, Matthew Gaines is right. The name was once Oboyn. I care little or nothing about tracing men's origins, but you will see, as I go on, that it must have had something to do with this case. I used to laugh at heredity, deeming it nonsense. I still think it is a rather overstrained process. After seeing a strange conclusion to a life, we hark back to supposititious causes. Gaines is the anglicizing, however, of a Flemish name. This Matthew Gaines's grandfather came to New England in the early part of the last century. Our State Historical Society informs me that there was a certain Gehnys, in 1739, who wrote music to sundry hymns and was paid 8s for writing the notes thereto. Then, again, he was rewarded with 8s for the fashioning of a trumpet which discoursed martial music as good as the best. He needed pots, pans, pewter platters, repaired clocks, fowling pieces, muskets, also pistols, likewise locks. I have copies of all these old notices. When he died, his son succeeded to the business, but he, in time, shut up his shop and carried a musket and blew a bugle during the revolution. When the war was over he settled in Connecticut and made shoe and harness buckles. He was a practical and hard-working man, and when he died in 1838 left what was thought to be a fortune for those days, which his son inherited. ""There are no doubts as to the career of Matthew the third when he came home. The people were amazed at the young man. I have read since about that big Donmar of Bombard, which must have struck some sympathetic chord in Matthew Gaines's brain. Bells and organs occupied his attention. New England at that time cared little for either. There seems to have been much that was visionary in the man's mind. I have found an occasional paper of his, printed in the scientific transactions of the time, which I am free to confess I cannot understand, probably because my studies were never directed in those lines. This Gaines married late in life. He spent all his money in experimenting with bells and organs. He and his wife died when their fortunes were at their lowest ebb, leaving a boy behind them. Ten years ago, before the railroad had quickened our dull ways, our village had no manufactories, but it soon went into business. Hither came a young man of twenty, who became foreman in Hobbs's brass foundry. His name was Matthew Gaines. There never was an Austin that had not some pretensions toward music. At least, we all could turn a tune and sing true. Solomon Potter was organist of our church. He behaved badly, was rarely sober, and had to be discharged. He got wind of it, left as abruptly, and so we were without an organist. On a certain Saturday Matthew Gaines called on me and offered his service. I remembered that once when my daughter Mary had a headache and a rehearsal for a Sunday-school festival was likely to be postponed, Matthew had taken her place at the piano and had acquitted himself creditably. Still, some stories I heard had rather prejudiced me against him. A lady, a summer visitor at the hotel, had told me that she had recognized in Gaines a piano performer she had heard a number of years before. He was, so she insisted, the ""youthful prodigy"" of some low performance. When Matthew asked me to let him take the place of the organist on the coming Sabbath I remembered the story and I hesitated. His hands were rather rough, and I suppose I looked at them rather than at his face. ""Mr. Austin,"" he said, ""your examination of my fingers I do not take amiss. Copper and brass poison the flesh, still my business pleases me, and I have not the least intention of leaving it. I do not want to be your organist, though I believe I could fill the place better than Potter."" That speech of Gaines's rather displeased me, for I thought it savored of arrogance. I said to him: ""Neither I nor the choir were aware that Mr. Potter's abilities were to be criticized. No matter what might have been his moral failings."" ""Excuse me, Mr. Austin,"" said Gaines, ""the man has been playing on an organ which has been out of tune for the last eight months. He never knew but two voluntaries, which he ground out over and over again. Strangers who came to service knowing something about music have found fault with his bungling ways. Your sermons, which breathed peace, hope, and charity, were followed by musical wrangling, coarseness, and vulgarity."" I did not heed Gaines's bitterly in regard to my poor sermons. I asked him at once: ""Did you ever quarrel with Solomon Potter?"" ""Never, though he gave me the opportunity; and pray excuse my impulsive ways, for I wanted to break his head."" ""This is very bad, young man; and might I ask the reason for this outburst of temper?"" ""He was rude to a lady."" ""And, pray, to whom?"" ""I would rather not give you the lady's name."" ""But you must."" ""Last Sunday then, his manner to Miss Austin was wanting in courtesy,"" he replied hotly. ""I did not know you were sufficiently acquainted with my daughter to act as her defender."" ""This will require further explanations,"" I was beginning to be angry, too. ""I never have exchanged five words with Miss Austin. She has a sweet voice, a true ear, and she sang the proper note, while his playing was false. I was in the gallery taking no part in the music. After the service Potter certainly said something to Miss Austin which was offensive; otherwise, it would not have brought the color to her face."" Evidently I was getting out of my depth. Miss Austin is not easily irritated, and besides that, never tells me of any of these insignificant details. Whether Potter was right or wrong has nothing to do with your application. It is true we may be very much put out for a while. We may have to dispense with the services of an organist. Reasons of economy might oblige us to do away with music for months to come. Now, you say the organ is out of tune. Could you repair it? And at what cost?"" ""That I could not tell. A reed may be out of place, or sprung, the woodwork warped. It might be the work of hours or days. I shall look at the organ."" ""Have you ever worked on one?"" I inquired. ""Certainly I have; otherwise, I would not be talking organ to you."" ""Potter ought to have had sense enough, when he knew a pipe was false, not to have spoiled his music."" ""And how?"" I inquired. ""Simply by not playing that particular note. He ought to have evaded it. A false note is like a vice, and vice may be inherent. It is the part of a wise man never to give his special vice prominence."" Somehow Matthew Gaines had touched on a particular doctrinal point of mine. What was better to my mind was that he undoubtedly knew about the doctoring of organs. ""You want to play for us then?"" I asked. ""Only until you have the means to hire a regular organist. I am a bell founder, a brass worker, and not a musician."" ""Well, I thank you. Let me think it over a little. I will send for you if we come to a decision, but I am not the only one to be consulted."" Thereupon Gaines left. When Mary came in, at once I asked her: ""Did you ever have any dispute with Mr. Potter?"" ""What reason have you for thinking so?"" she enquired. ""Did it happen last Sunday?"" ""How did you know it, father?"" I took that for an affirmative reply. ""Do you know how Mr. Gaines can acquit himself on the organ?"" ""Oh, I know he can play very well. Almost a year ago there was something amiss with the organ. Don't you recollect the horrid squawk it made, and how the little boys, and as for that the whole congregation, misbehaved themselves? Mr. Porter made a great to-do about it. Mr. Hobbs sent Mr. Gaines to the church. I was walking in the street when I heard the organ peal out grandly, in a way I had never heard before. I knew it was not Mr. Potter playing, for I had seen him lounging about somewhere."" ""Then Gaines must be proficient?"" ""I should think so."" ""You know nothing prejudicial to Mr. Gaines's character, Mary?"" ""What can you mean, father? I know nothing about him, only that he is more of a musician than anybody in the town. You remember that old hymnal of 1838, a stray copy of which had been in one of the pews so long? I happened to open it a few days ago, and found many of the chords corrected in it, marked with a pencil, and I want to suppose Mr. Gaines did it, because nobody else could. Mr. Gaines played for us that Sunday, and for many other Sundays, and the music was pleasant to my ears, and the congregation admired his performance."" So it came about that my Mary and Matthew became better acquainted. I really did not appreciate him at his worth until a highly-cultured Boston clergyman, who had brought a letter of introduction to me, went quite wild over Matthew's playing of a voluntary. ""Mr. Austin,"" he said, ""where did you find such a proficient organist? In my church he would be worth $2,000 a year. If he ever wants to change, give him a word to me, and of course you would endorse his character."" Some of the congregation then made up a purse. I was told about it, and arrangements were made to give the money to Gaines. I sounded him about it and met with a flat refusal. ""I have no desire to be your organist. If I have to overhaul your organ, which I may have to do before long, that is so much time taken from Mr. Hobbs, and you will have to pay him for that. I am more interested at present in my work in the foundry than organs. Mr. Hobbs's bells are wretched. A bell to him is as a stove, a casting worth so much a pound."" ""But you have improved our organ, Mr. Gaines."" ""Oh, I doctored the flute stop; it shuffled. The tone is, perhaps, better, but increase of sonority brings with it harshness. Vibratory impulses have their limitations. You can't crowd a pipe or a bell. Put too much stress on one or the other, and the purity vanishes. The great lungs of a lion, the delicate larynx of a lark, both require their exact volumes of air."" ""Let me hope, Matthew, that you will then doctor our organ for many years to come,"" I said. ""And if a careless organist were to play on it, Mr. Gaines would be like Penelope,"" said Mary, laughing. Then we talked organs and I broached the vox humana, for it was the crux of an organ. ""Mr. Gaines laughed, ""No, Mr. Austin, it is the Latin that carries out step through. The human voice can never be imitated. We may make all the wind instruments, for then a man only repeats his work, but the song that gushes from human lips defies us. We can speak a broken-down voice, its nasal defects, as in a Punch and Judy show, but with metal or wood, shape and turn it as we may, we only produce the saddest imitations of those sounds which God has given alone to those he made like unto himself."" I began to know Matthew better and liked him much, and when Mary, though she was sorely troubled, said to me, ""Father, I needs must blush, but it is not for shame, for Matthew loves me,"" I took her trembling hand in mine and, kissing her, said: ""Mary, the rest of your sentence is understood; you need not tell it."" I knew it was coming. Matthew wrote me about it all when he was away for ten days, and you were so unhappy; but has he told you everything of his past life? God reclaims many a burning brand. There are callings which through temptation tease. Had only your poor mother been alive. ""Father, Matthew has told me all about his life, his early misery, his education in an orphanage, where he was harshly treated. There he was the musical prodigy, the show boy of the school. A strolling company lured him away. Fagged beyond his power of endurance, he was thrown among the worst associations. In time he freed himself from the clutches of these men. His mechanical instincts seem early to have shown him a way to live. There is nothing to need be ashamed of."" ""And, Mary, you loved him after he had told his story?"" ""No, before, and Mary hid her face from me. ""Mary, the Austin blood is good, and those who bear that name have been mostly patient, plodding people. Sometimes I am afraid your Matthew wants tenacity of purpose."" He astonished me at times. I live in a sober world. He flies unto space, I try to follow him, as would a heavy-winged bird, and he soars and circles far above me. I admire him, but I stay of him in a business sense. ""Experiments,"" says Hobbs, ""other chaps may pay for,"" but Hobbs confessed that the rule of thumb didn't always hold good in bell casting. Hobbs is clear-fisted and honest. There was a bell to be cast, the biggest job Hobbs had yet made, and Matthew wanted a certain mixture of metal and a particular form for the casting, and so backed up his argument with a roar of algebraic sums. ""What do I know about these bore tubes, Mr. Austin?"" said Hobbs, when he showed them to me. ""Quite as much as I do, Matthew Hobbs,"" I replied. ""Then I agreed to refer it to a great professor of physics at Cambridge. You know, Mary, I mentioned his name with awe at times, but he, with that patrician lawyer, are old friends. Those figures expressed an acoustic equivalent, so came the answer from that blessed professor, and that great scientific authority called me his dear old Oliver, and he said that Matt Gaines's principle was sound and that it could only come from someone who had that subject or Mayer at his finger's end. And Matthew was right. Perfectly so."" So I questioned Matthew, having looked up in the village library all I could find about the science of sound, and Matthew will forget more than I ever knew about these subjects, for, Mary, your father is a perfect nincompoop about such things! There were some happy days in store for us, and pleasantly sounded the organ on Sundays, and how sweetly Mary sang! When my girl was to be married was not exactly decided upon, Matthew had been saving and had $800 put aside, Mary had been diligent, but now was all abloom with happiness. Those were blessed evenings we spent together. When December came and the first logs crackled on the hearth, seated in my chair I would read the old books I loved. Now, Matthew had made some improvements on the sounding board of a piano. It was about that sounding board I wrote to you, on which Matthew had secured a patent. An instrument-maker in New York sent to him a piano to work on, and he had put it in our little room. He would sit at the piano by the hour and play for Mary. She would sing at times. I thought her sweet voice had never been better attuned, but somehow Matthew would never let her sing long for him. Occasionally the choir would come, and, dear me! how carefully he drilled them. He wrote some chorals for our children, and they sounded ever so fine. One night there was a howling storm outside, the wind soughing, and Matt had been playing some old anthem, when, quick as a flash, he rattled off a wild dance. Then Mary looked at him with wide-opening eyes and asked him what had disturbed him. I heard him say, ""That gallopade, Mary, I played once on just such a wild night as this when I was barely fifteen years old. It happened in a horrible cellar, while men and women, the offscourings of a city, danced and howled around me. My master, who was crazy with drink, wanted to ply me with liquor. I reached forward to seize the proffered glass, when a woman, her face a-lilac with paint, struck the tumbler from my hand. 'You shall not ruin this little beggar,' she cried, and sat near me and filled my cup for me, and kissed me, and whether she was maudlin or not she had a good heart. I have often thought about her, and I pray that God may have saved that poor soul."" I had heard him tell it all, and when he had finished, I rose from my chair and I went on my knees and asked forgiveness for that poor lost woman, and for all our sins. I thought I knew Matthew better now, and felt he had true charity. It had been arranged between them that early in the spring they were to be wedded. The two were to live with me. Matthew's prospects were good, for Hobbs was what help his foreman gave him. One day Matthew came in with a letter, an offer to go to New York state to superintend the building of a shop, where bell-founding was to be the leading business. A good monthly salary was to be paid. It was not prejudicial to Hobbs, for Hobbs had given Matthew his consent to superintend the new work, and if things looked well Hobbs proposed taking some interest in the enterprise. I could not say yea or nay. It did seem to me a fair scheme and likely to advance Matthew's interests. So Matthew left us, and I bade him godspeed. Mary was cheerful and held up bravely. While away Matt wrote frequently. He was well and full of his work and hopeful of success. But my poor Mary! Somehow, there came on her a sudden change. Before I was conscious of it she fell ill. I was anxious, terribly anxious about her. Like her mother, she was fast fading away. It was so very rapid. The doctor looked grave. Affrighted, I telegraphed Matthew. He replied that he would come at once. Then fell the hardest snowstorm we had for years, and every railroad in the land was blocked. Matthew was detained on the road thirty-six hours, and before he came Mary had gone to her Maker. ""And Matthew Gaines,"" I asked, ""what of him?"" ""Matt, poor Matt! Within a few miles of his destination someone had carelessly given him our village paper. It had printed a notice of Mary's death."" We found the paper in his hand. The news struck him as would a blow from a hammer. I think he did try to talk to us about Mary, but his speech was inarticulate. It was not paralysis. All the leading doctors in the state treated Matt, so that they might study his case. Some of the doctors were inclined to trace it to heredity; others to the effect of early privation. The kindest of them all said to me: ""Broken hearts are rare, very rare, but a broken brain, when a man who loves, is not so uncommon."" I do not think he knows where my Mary, his Mary, lies sleeping. He has some faint musical sense. He lives with me, and sometimes I fancy his eyes wander and he seeks that far-distant light invisible to us. He does not require the least constraint. There is one single trait that remains of his former self. Mr. Hobbs has been good to him. Matt goes to the foundry almost every day. In the pattern loft he has a little room. Such scraps of copper and bits of metal as he may want are given to him. He has a few tools. The workmen, who all know him, lend him a helping hand for certain mechanical appliances which he cannot now manage. He tinkers away and casts and solders cowbells. These bells are said to be far sweeter in tone than any that can be bought. Our hardware dealer tells me that if Matt could make them in quantity he could find a ready sale for them. Farming people have queer ideas. They fancy that a harsh-sounding bell annoys a cow and spoils her milk, and have a notion besides that Matt's bells bring their creatures good luck. But if he makes a bell or two a week that is all he can do. All those cows there have Matt's bells around their necks. Is he happy? Pray God he may be, but he never smiles. From entertaining many grand and lofty conceptions, Matt is satisfied now with fashioning cowbells. So end many worldly aspirations. Poor Mary! At times in church I think I hear her sweet voice singing in praise of God. May it be done. THE BABY The little tottering baby feet, With faltering steps and slow, With pattering echoes soft and sweet, Into my heart they go. They also sow in grimy clay, In muddy pools and dusty ways, Then through the house in trackful play They wander to and fro. The baby hands that clasp my neck With touches dear to me Are the same hands that smash and wreck The inkstand full to see. They pound the mirror with a cane; They rend the manuscript in twain; Widespread destruction they ordain In wasteful jubilee. The dreamy, murmuring baby voice That coos its little tune, That makes my listening heart rejoice Like birds in leafy June, Can make it raindrops dark and still, And all the air with howling oil, That splits the ear with echoes shrill, I, the cornets out of tune. -Hob Burdette, Old Friend How did you and your wife come to remarry after so many years of separation? Jimson Well you see, in the trial suits for divorce, she made me out so bad, and I made her out so bad, that there wouldn't be anybody else have either of us. Brooklyn Life, Rev. Flock Plunk on Speculation The man that speculates in spiritual matters, does so at a fearful risk; for when he dies he tries to collect a gilded dividend on a pewter investment and finds that he ain't able to pay great extent."
"18920211","MM 11009 90 Feed is quiet and without change. We quote bran $16-$17, shorts $18-$19, and meal $25. At Chicago wheat closed at 89c May, corn was 41c March, 42½c May, and oats at 31½c May. Messrs. Oswald Bros., 13 and 15 Hospital street, report the opening, closing, highest and lowest quotations of grain and provisions at Chicago to-day as follows: Wheat March, May, 0 88 0 88 Feb, March, 0 41 0 41 0 41 0 41 May, 0 41½ 0 43½ Oats, Feb, March, May, 0 1¼ 0 31¼ 0 31½ Pork Feb, March, May, 12 00 19 07 11 03 13 69 Lard Feb, March, May, 6 70 6 73 6 70 6 70 ILL. Irwin, Green & Co.'s Chicago special to the Gazette says: Wheat opened very irregular, with a general feeling of approaching panic caused by the wild talk in the newspapers regarding the prospects of harmful legislation at Washington. It was soon found, however, that but little wheat was for sale, and that there were good Eastern buying orders in the market and prices rallied from the start, very little wheat being sold below 89c. The foolish panic, which had seized the trade yesterday, abated materially and the market was steady with a firm tone for some time, with a good cash inquiry reported at surrounding markets. Bradstreet's figures show a decrease of 829,000 bushels for the week. This helped the strength slightly. Late public cables came in weak and lower, as would be expected, and a heavy snowstorm started in here, so that the market weakened off temporarily but quickly recovered and closed firm at 89½c. It was difficult to buy wheat at the late advance, offerings being very limited. Private cables confirm the serious damage to the French crop. A late Washington rumor has it that the so-called ""Option bill"" has been indefinitely postponed and, singularly, this has a strengthening effect. Fifty-seven loads were reported for export at the seaboard. Corn and oats followed the lead of wheat chiefly, but averaged firm. Corn was quite active at times, and there is a firm cash demand, which fully absorbs daily receipts. Provisions were nervous and irregular, within a narrow range. Ribs were comparatively active and firm. Messrs. Buhwarts, Dunce McCormick, of Chicago, telegraph Oswald Bros., 13 and 15 Hospital street, as follows: Wheat opened at about 88c-89c, sold up to 89c, weakening without any special cause to 88c, then rallying to 90c, and finally closing at 89c. The last advance was on export purchases at New York for French account, and a rumor that the Anti-Option bill had been indefinitely postponed. The latter, however, is a canard. Crop reports were generally favorable, and Bradstreet's made a decrease of about 800,000 bu. Crops were weak and the outlook rather moderate. We think the uncertainty in regard to the anti-option matter will for some time have a tendency to restrict business. Corn rallied with wheat and for the same reason, May sold between 41½c and 42½c, and closed at 41¾c. Receipts were light, and there was no contract trade. Exports from the seaboard this week are a good deal under last week. We feel friendly to corn, and believe purchases made around 48c will prove profitable. Oats were firm but dull. May sold between 31c and 31½c, closing at 31¼c. This grain simply followed the others. The receipts of hogs were 84,000, and prices opened lower, with the quality rather inferior. Tomorrow's estimates are 60,000. Provisions sold off on a deal of speculative holdings, but firmed up at the closing in sympathy with grain. Packers were moderate buyers of May ribs. We see no change in the legitimate situation in provisions, but prices are liable to weaken at any time on the anti-option scares. May pork sold from $11.90 to $12.05, closing at $12.02. May ribs from $5.02½ to $6.10 and $6.12, closing at $6.07½. Lard from $6.65 to $6.67 closing at $6.70. At New York wheat closed at $1.02 February, $1.01 May. At Milwaukee wheat closed at 83½c for February and 87½c for May. At St. Louis wheat closed at 88¾c for February and 90c for May. At Toledo wheat closed at 92c for February and 96c May. At Duluth, wheat, No. 1 hard, closed at 84½c for February and 89c for May. No. 1 Northern closed at 83½c for February and 88c for May.

The Liverpool public cable says: Wheat, quiet, demand poor; holders offer moderately; corn dull, demand poor. London, February 8. The Mark Lane Express, in its weekly review of the British grain trade, says: The prices of English wheats are still declining. When offered at 6d reduction the trade is slow, but when it is conceded ready buyers are found. Foreign wheats are irregularly lower. At Liverpool there has been 3d per cental decline on Californian and 2d decline on other sorts of American wheats. Flour has dropped 6d per sack. Corn has fallen 1s without encouraging a demand. Barley is almost no-saleable at 1s decline. Oats have lost 3d and linseed 6d. At today's market English wheats were firmer without quotable advance. Foreign wheat was held at 6d advance, American was readily bought at the time. Flour was in better demand and prices were up 1d. American corn was 6d higher. Oats and barley were in better request at a fractional advance. The prices of beans and peas were still in favor of buyers. Receipts of grain are as follows: At Chicago the receipts were 28,974 flour, 79,000 wheat, 100,000 corn, 165,000 oats, 7,000 rye, 73,000 barley, and the shipments 25,317 flour, 46,000 wheat, 333,000 corn, 208,000 oats, 11,000 rye, 83,000 barley. At New York the receipts were 11,001 brls, 11,013 sacks flour, 70,600 wheat, 143,375 corn, 134,275 oats, 13,178 rye, 22,500 barley, and the shipments, 6,105 brls, 7,396 sacks flour, 312,484 wheat, 66,173 corn, 866 oats, 17,400 rye, 35,039 barley. At Milwaukee the receipts were 13,400 flour, 24,000 wheat, 3,000 corn, 11,000 oats, 1,000 rye, 36,000 barley, and the shipments, 2,900 flour, 1,000 wheat, 6,000 corn, 24,000 oats, 2,000 rye, 20,000 barley. At Toledo the receipts were 6,000 wheat, 26,000 corn, and the shipments 7,000 wheat, 71,000 corn, 2,000 rye. At St. Louis the receipts were 27,000 wheat, 242,000 corn, 27,000 oats, and the shipments 17,000 wheat, 132,000 corn, 61,000 oats. At Duluth the receipts were 79,000 wheat and the shipments 6,000. At Minneapolis the receipts were 232,000 wheat, and the shipments 58,000. The provision market is strong under light supplies of pork, which assists in maintaining values on a firm basis. Canadian short ribs, per brl, $11.00 to $13.50. Menu pork, western, per brl, $11.00 to $11.60. Short ribs, western, per brl, $16.00 to $18.60. Hams, city cured, per lb, 10½c to 11½c. Lard, Canadian, in pails, 8½c to 8¾c. Bacon, per lb, 8c to 11c. At Chicago provisions were about steady, pork closing at $12.02 for May, and lard at $6.70. The hog market was steady. The limited receipts of hogs were 38,000; the official report of yesterday was 38,230, of which 11,011 were shipped and 1,000 leftover. The market today was 5c-10c lower. Quotations: Light mixed, $4.80 to $4.90; mixed packing, $4.60 to $4.90; rough grades, $4.35 to $4.60. Receipts of cattle, 20,000, for which the market was lower. At Liverpool provisions closed: Pork, 62s 6d; lard, 84s 6d; bacon, 82s 8d; light, 83s; tallow, 25s 6d. Produce: The cheese market continued firm but dull. Prices are hard to quote, but it would certainly take 11c and over to move fluent fall white. Butter is steady with quiet jobbing trade at quotations. Fine creamery, 34c to 34½c. The New York Bulletin says: Although no great amount of animation prevailed there was demonstration enough on the part of buyers to make a fair market and reveal a continued element of strength throughout. Several of the exporters were on hand working about from one house to another, and while they did not appear ready to talk about fancy stock, they were buying goods from 11c for ice house stock down, including some very good lots of skims, and all at full former rates. We understand that at the close of last week a bunch of 610 boxes sold for export on the basis of present quotations, and there has also been a lot of 600 boxes flat early made sharp cheese sold to a local dealer at somewhere around 10c, probably no higher. The latest mail advices from abroad are cheerful and promising, and among other things confirm sales of fancy stock at 60s. On domestic account some very fair deals are working along, and altogether, for the commencement of the week, the showing is a good one. The Pennsylvania skims continue to receive attention mostly from exporters, and have been mainly sold to arrive at 30c-33c, which is a little better. The egg market does not show any change, but stocks are pressing slightly, although holders still talk firmly. We quote 11c to 12c; best stock, 10c to 12c."

Mr. Barron, the Liberal, had a majority in the general elections last year of 201 and beat Hnffbeg, the Conservative candidate this year, as he was last hoped. Only it cleared this away and obtained just enough to make him entitled to the seat. In his most sanguine moments he never expected to achieve such a victory as he did and when the returns tonight showed that he had a majority of 133 the Conservative enthusiasm knew no bounds nor the Grit despair depths.

The fight was one of the hottest ever made in Bruce, but the people got thoroughly sick of the moss, groan arguments of the Reformers and the played out Ottawa corruption charges, and gave Mr. Cargill a majority enough to take him to Ottawa.

As in the north riding of Victoria, the astounding revelations of robberies by Laurier's lieutenant in Quebec, Count Mercler, and the threadbare and stale unrestricted reciprocity arguments did more to hurt the Reformers than they did their man good.

The fiercest snowstorm experienced here for years is raging here tonight. The snowfall is the heaviest of the season and the furious gale caused a veritable blizzard. The storm will be very disastrous to shipping on the coast as it is one of the wildest nights imaginable. The storm commenced shortly after the election returns began to come in, and traffic being greatly impeded, it was extremely difficult to obtain returns from many points. The figures so far to hand, there being fifteen places yet to hear from, indicate the election of Kenny and Stairs (Conservatives) by between 400 and 600 majority. The returns, so far received, are as follows: M 1 09 s a t Halifax City, W. Sweatnam, residing near Latonls, testified against three moonshiners. Last night his house was surrounded while he was absent. His son James, nine years old, answered a call at the door and was riddled with bullets, dying instantly.

THE NEW YORK LIFE, Application to Mr. McCall Disappears What the Proficient President Demands, New York, February 11. At a meeting held here this afternoon of the managers and general agents of the New York Life Insurance Company it soon became apparent that all opposition to Mr. McCall had evaporated and that his election to the presidency tomorrow is practically a foregone conclusion. This brings the inclination of the opposing William U. Appleton, heretofore a strong supporter of Mr. McCall, to be the unanimous choice of the meeting for the presidency of the New York Life Insurance Company. The vote to that effect was unanimous. It was said that Mr. McCall had notified the directors that he could not accept the presidency of the company unless ex-President Hcors ceases to have any connection with the management, and he also makes the condition that he be presented with the resignations of all the present directors of the company. This is said to mean that Mr. McCall is determined to be boss of the situation and everything the word president implies. It was also said he simply desired these resignations so that he may reject those of them he may deem proper. NOTES FROM THE CAPITAL A Magnificent Education Fund for Manitoba from the Sale of School Lands Brave Men Rewarded, (From our own correspondent, Ottawa, February 11.) The last school land sale in Manitoba for this season took place at Deloraine yesterday with the most satisfactory result, 6,911 acres selling for $44,699, or an average of $7.89 per acre. This is considered exceedingly good in view of the fact that a good deal of the land was squatted on and consequently the competition was not keen. The following is a recapitulation of the school land sales this year: Humber Amount of acres of which Morden, 11,971 $198, 13 J'llOt Moubd 1, 9,831 Glendon 6, 9(5 18,997 Portage la Prairie 1, 9""2 10, 1, 983 88,40! Brandon 1, 76 17, to Winnipeg 1, 83 85, 874 Deloraine 6,814 41, 6, 9 ' Totals 68, 038 $431,45. This makes an average of $7.96 per acre all round, which is considered excellent, as most of the land was ordinary unimproved farm land, not specially well situated. Of the amount of the sales one-fifth, or over $80,000, was paid in cash, which, added to the $130,000 now to the credit of the fund, will make considerably over $200,000, with annual payments of over $80,000 coming in. The total quantity of school lands reserved in the surveyed portion of Manitoba is about eight hundred thousand acres, of which about one hundred thousand have been sold for nearly six hundred thousand dollars. By the terms of the act the proceeds of the sales of school lands remain in the hands of the Dominion Government in trust and only the interest, at three and a half percent, is available for school purposes. This interest will be paid to the provincial Government for school purposes, but so far no payment has been made except a special advance of $30,000 for buildings, made some years ago, partly by the Liberal Government, partly by the Conservatives. By the wise management of the Conservative Government this fund promises, in the course of the next ten or fifteen years, to amount to one of the most noble endowments for school purposes ever known. The same principle was adopted for the Northwest Territories, but so far only a few special sales have been made there. The prices obtained, however, were very good.

The Vienna correspondent of the Grahie says: The destitution that prevails here at present is greater than it has been in many years. Thousands of respectable persons of the laboring classes are idle and starving through the operation of the new American tariff. A large percentage of the mechanics here are glad to emigrate, but are deterred from doing so by conscription. The misery of the poor people in this city is enhanced by an influx from the provinces of a large number of persons who are out of employment and are flocking to Vienna in the hope of obtaining work. The total number of unemployed persons in this city is estimated at 70,000. It is hoped that the extension of the city limits will give an impetus to building operations and public works, which the Government is inaugurating, will also improve the deplorable state of affairs.

To relieve headache and relieve all the troubles incident to a bilious state of the system, such as faintness, nausea, drowsiness, distress after eating, pain in the stomach, etc. While their most remarkable success has been shown in curing headache, yet Castor's Little Liver Pills are equally valuable in constipation, curing and preventing this annoying complaint. While they also correct all disorders of the stomach, stimulate the liver and regulate the bowels, if they only cured headache they would be almost priceless to those who suffer from this distressing complaint; but fortunately their goodness does not end here, and those who once try them will find these little pills valuable in so many ways that they will not be willing to do without them. But after all, sick headache is the bane of so many lives that here is where we make our great boast. Our pills cure it while others do not. Castor's Little Liver Pills are very small and very easy to take. One or two pills make a dose.

strength all day there were several weak points during the semi on caused by various reports regarding the llutoh bill and r'nrdla's intention to remove the prohibitive' prohibitive' clause on wheat

receipts moderate Braditntt was not reported today and it looks as if someone had it toward class as New York bought a good deal of wheat We are going into a weather market and news from now on will

fourteen cars of all kinds of grain Cincinnati February 15 The second week of February has given us fairly good weather taking into consideration the fact that we have had no severe storms either of rain or snow and no great drop in the mercury The snow in the southern and eastern portion of the winter wheat belt has all disappeared and the plant is now exposed to all the changing weather which is before it I still confirm my statements of a week ago to the effect that there has been no material injury to the winter wheat up to date occasioned by the weather we have experienced during the last thirty days With the exception of Tennessee and Kentucky wheat has shown very little germination yet This is accounted for from the fact of its weakly condition and its general backwardness Very little wheat is moving out of farmers' hands as they hardly know just what to do on account of the uncertainty of the present crop's outcome while the bills now before Congress with regard to future sales have unsettled and will continue to affect prices greatly The movement of corn in the interior is restricted owing to the advance in price yet there is no accumulation at the railroad stations compared with a year ago In the spring wheat areas the absence of snow and the comparatively mild weather inclines farmers to think they are going to have a much earlier spring than usual That seems to be the trend of opinion at the present time all over the Northwest Of course at this season of the year we are liable to have heavy snowstorms and all sorts of weather but the general complexion of things has not pointed in that direction up to date stovemeaia f Wraua aol flour At Chicago the receipts were 81930 flour 64,000 wheat 306,000 corn 365,000 oats 9,000 rye 91,000 barley and the

of the two cities, ""that's in our favor; we know how to clean our streets, and we're not content to ride let lumbering, refrigerating street cars, which are about as much on a par with the old stage coaches would be ""We've got twelve miles of electric railway track, and the cars have never been stopped by the heaviest snowstorm there has been this winter ""Everybody rides in them, and everybody finds it a pleasure to do so ""They are all upholstered and heated by stoves or electricity, I've walked about your streets all day, and am devoutly thankful that all my limbs are yet intact ""In Ottawa our streets are cleaned by the corporation, and if not always perfect, there is at least uniformity about them, so that one is not constantly in dread of jerking his head off by unexpectedly taking a step downward of a foot or so ""Here is a matter for the City council to consider during the summer If taken up then it might have a tendency to cool the passions which only too frequently arise during the so-called debates ""It would be quite refreshing during August or September to consider the proper means to be employed for the removal of snow from the sidewalks, and the question should be settled then, unless the Mayor should rule it out of season or ""everything all out of order, gentlemen,"" as he phrases it ""This question of removing snow from the sidewalks was on the order sheet last fall, but it went the way of most lucky as by-laws which attain that stage, It was proposed to have certain streets cleaned by the corporation at the expense of the proprietors on the street, with the ostensible object of providing work for the unemployed ""Ward councillors killed the project, however ""Some aldermen wanted the city to undertake the cleaning of the whole city, but as this could not be done THEY WOULD ALLOW NO PART of the work to be undertaken ""If John Thomas is given a jam tart for lunch by his mother, why Thomas John must have one also, or he will raise a howl that will be heard all down the street ""The present council should take this question up early in the summer, so that the Road department will be able to commence work on the first snowfall next winter ""If the city cannot undertake the removal of snow from the sidewalks in the back lanes and the streets in the suburbs there is no reason why the principal business streets, such as Craig, St James, Notre Dame, St Paul, St Lawrence and St Catherine, should not be kept in proper condition ""This work is at present left to the proprietors or tenants, and is done in a most erratic, unsystematic manner ""In front of stores the work is generally left to the office boy ""This young autocrat considers the work infra dig, and everyone knows the result ""He is often just budding into swallow-tails and foppish manners, and why should his tapering white fingers be soiled by contact with the handle of a snow shovel? Gabriel Varden never imposed a pre shameful servitude upon Mr. Simon Tapper, that prince of consequential young apprentices ""The work of this type of street cleaner is only equalled in badness by that of the professional snow shoveller ""He is generally a decrepit old man, driven to this work by necessity ""He has several contracts on hand with merchants and others to clean their sidewalks, and the result of his feebleness and multiplicity of duties is that no section of the work is done well or on time ""And then what variations in style one sees, what phantasies in snow ""Each affects a peculiar system of his own ""One considers the best form not a sidewalk, is what is popularly called a ""hog's back,"" while another holds the opinion that the snow must be removed clear down to the pavement ""The artist in the next section considers that all that is necessary is to flatten out the snow into the semblance of a smooth surface ""Assuredly there are many ""ups and downs"" in our sidewalks, as well as in life ""One of the most embarrassing experiences in life those mild days is to come across a man with pick and shovel mining for the hard pavement You stand on a snow-grimed, slippery block of ice, with the option of taking a drop of a foot or more or going out into the vehicle-crowded street Probably you make the plunge and your foot strikes on a round piece of ice, much more treacherous than a piece of lemon pie, and your legs plough up the loosened blocks of ice, while your head comes down with a pleasant pat on the step behind ""Others laugh, but you don't You rise up in a calm frame of mind, and some would-be wag asks you if you are hurt, or if you fell, and you vow in your wrath that you will bring pressure on your eldermanic representatives to have this thing remedied, but you never carry out your intention ""Your clothes are soiled, and you are sore on the world, and part of yourself, for the rest of the day ""Or, probably, you are walking along the street in a contemplative frame of mind, and an icicle rattles down on your head and then someone shouts ""Look out there!"" You look up instead, and see a demon seated unnon-respectfully in a window (out of your reach, fortunately for him), with a long pole in his hand playfully tapping the long pendants from the eaves and the Gothic windows of the attic ""A little further down the street two poles rest against the wall; avalanches of snow are tumbling from the roof of the building, and the magnificent form of a policeman is to be seen on the street corner, the limb of the law chatting pleasantly to the cabbler on the stand, while the genial afternoon sun lights up the figures of your friend smiling artistically on the other side of the street ""You know, or have heard somewhere, that it is AGAINST THE LAW TO SHOVEL SNOW off a tool after nine o'clock in the morning, but then, who ever heard of the police enforcing the city ordinance? Before the Chief can act it is necessary for some reputable citizen to lay information before him, and besides, this is the duty of the street inspector ""Why should the hard-worked policeman notice an infraction of this law? He might offend an alderman's friend and lose his position ""If anyone doubts that this work of street cleaning would be better done by the city than when left to property owners or occupants, such a one should take a walk along Craig street and then turn up St. Denis ""The Craig street sidewalk is almost impassable It is full of holes and covered with treacherous hummocks The same system of shoveling is not followed for one block No matter how vigorous you are your faith in your balancing powers becomes shaken ""On St. Denis street, crossing Viger square, it is different This section is done on a system, and the director of that system is Mr. St. George, the city surveyor It is kept level and smooth, and when it becomes slippery it is sanded It is the only good piece of sidewalk in the city One gentleman, who lives on Hanguinet street, told the Gazette that he always went around by St. Denis street for the pleasure of walking on a good piece of sidewalk during the winter ""With a few scrapers, a few horses and a squad of men every principal street in the city could be similarly well cleaned A by-law to provide for the cleaning of snow from the principal streets of the city should be at once placed on the first order of the council proceedings If nothing went amiss, it might be reached, considered and passed before the swallows had returned southward from their summer pilgrimage to Montreal Then, if the work were left in the hands of Mr. St. George, there is no fear but that it would be properly executed"

"18920308","35, I've Stock Notes, The shipments of cattle from Boston since the list of January were 20,128 head which were distributed as follows: London 8,200, Liverpool 8,302, Glasgow 3,620. Judging from the interviews which have appeared lately in the Scotch and English papers one would imagine that Mr. John Crowe, who is on the other side at present, was a special immigration officer. The Hindu papers publish interviews two columns in length in which Mr. Crowe points out the great importance of the Canadian live stock. Under M I U in full, he describes the many advantages Canada offers to farmers, he describes Saskatchewan wheat as the finest in the world, and says it is the best province in the world for young men of ""go"" and that there is still room for 20,000,000 people. Mr. James Eakins, of Port Hope, has returned from an extended visit to England and Scotland, with his usual modesty, he refused an interview to the Gazette; but in the course of conversation said that the prospects for a good season's trade are none too good. The Scotch and English farmers who fedlanded cattle during the winter find it hard to sell their fat at a profit owing to the competition of Americans, notwithstanding the fact that they bought the stock very low in the fall, beef is plentiful; if the farmers could only sell their fat stock at a fair profit trade in stockers would no doubt be satisfactory. During his month's sojourn Mr. Eakins studied the political situation very carefully, and has come to the conclusion that the British Government will eventually resign, and that the Parnellites and McCarthyites will come together under one leader. BRITISH LIVE STOCK MARKET A Temporary Falling off In Supplies of Cattle Canada Should Maintain the Strictest Sanitary Regulations with the United States General Market Reports: (Special correspondence to the Gazette) Livermore, February 27. Three more outbreaks of foot-and-mouth have been reported since Saturday last, but in no instance has the number of cattle attacked been serious, and with the prompt measures available by the officers of the Board of Agriculture the outbreaks were practically stamped out at first blow. In my last letter I referred to the fact that Denmark has never known the disease, but I learn from a statement in the Field, that while this is quite true, the distemper appears from time to time in Holstein, a country that has no dividing frontier with Denmark, beyond the imaginary one drawn for political rather than sanitary purposes. Between the two countries Denmark and Holstein there is a regular trade in cattle to supply the Hamburg market, and the return of tainted cattle trucks from a district in which the disease has existed for some weeks, and so far as is known, still exists, is a circumstance which suggests means for the conveyance of the infection. The sum and substance of this is that a country wherein there is no disease should be exceedingly careful in maintaining the strictest sanitary regulations with its neighbors say Canada with the United States, just to make the application of the lesson a little direct. After the glut of ten days ago we have had a falling off quite big enough to make buyers look sharp. This week the arrivals only fit up 1,580 head (including the Halifax shipment), while last week they ran up to 4,091. The shipments of fresh beef this week are weightier by 1,000 qrs, but that hardly counts. Beef at the markets is worth 5d to 6d say, 6d Old, for cattle, some people say we shall see the beef itself worth 6d, but I don't see it myself. After all, this was an exceptionally curious week. The snowstorm in Ireland prevented, or rather delayed, the movement of cattle there to the seaboard. Heavy fogs further delayed the arrivals of Channel steamers bound from the continent and from Ireland, all of which resulted in our early markets being a bit short of usual supply, but only here and there was there any sharp advance. For next week we have quite a biggish number of cattle due from the States, and I should not wonder if prices went back to 6d or 6d for good beasts, but one never can tell, and it is still too early to prophesy."
"18920311","Tom o, March 10, A story has reached here that has caused many expressions of indignation by the English papers. To the westward of County Mayo, behind, there lies in the Atlantic a small patch of land known as Clare Island. The inhabitants are mostly fishermen and are miserably poor. A number of them ran into debt and their creditors took proceedings against them and sent bailiffs to seize the few little owned by the debtors to satisfy the claims against them. The Islanders resisted the bailiffs and as a result eighty of them were summoned to answer at Louisburg, the nearest town on the mainland, in the County of Mayo, for resisting the officers of the law. The eighty Islanders obeyed the summons and presented themselves before the magistrate. They all appeared to be in a starving condition and their thin garments afforded them little protection from the inclement weather. A Magistrate's Cruelly, The magistrate listened to the testimony of the bailiffs and then calmly ordered that the further hearing of the case be held the next day at the courthouse in Westport, 13 miles distant. To reach Westport in time for the hearing it was necessary for the islanders to start that night. They had no money to pay for conveyances and were compelled to walk the entire distance over a road that is none too good in fine weather. Last night a blinding snowstorm set in. The road runs alongside the ocean, and the poor people stumbling along in the darkness were exposed to the full fury of a stinging gale that swept inland from the sea. Many of the poor, ill-clad islanders, weakened by their long abstinence from nourishing food, fell by the roadside unable to proceed and would have perished had it not been for the kind-hearted volunteers along the route who, when they learned of their suffering, went to their assistance and succored them with food and shelter. Of the women in the party not a single one had strength enough to drag her weary limbs to Westport. The Goodness of the Crown, The men who reached the town at once proceeded to the courthouse and presented themselves before the magistrates there sitting to hear the case. Many of the islanders were almost completely exhausted by their long and toilsome journey and all of them were frozen and half-frozen. When the magistrates learned that all the persons summoned were not present they were incensed at what they were pleased to term disrespect for the law. They held forth at great length upon the strong arm of the law and how all, rich and poor alike, were amenable to its provisions. Then they spoke of the great goodness of the Crown, how it tempered justice with mercy, and after dwelling upon this subject to the painful edification of the shivering wretches before them they announced that as the defendants had pleaded guilty to the charge against them the Crown would extend its clemency to them. The court then ordered that the men be liberated upon giving bail for their good behavior. The dispatch does not state whether the bail demanded was furnished, but the islanders were not known in Westport and as they have nothing of value of their own the probabilities are that the bonds were not furnished.

"18920312","Fxtiemes moot the beautiful ussociules with the bad - Yesterday's storm was one of the more severe storms we used to have forty years ago. Strictly speaking, it was not the same snowstorm that never puts in a second appearance, but it was a good imitation in a small sort of way of one of those monumental historical snowstorms that we read about in the novels of the writer who has never lived or been in Canada. Canada, his work demands a snowstorm, and as it is not always convenient to go to Russia or advisable to go to Siberia, he uses Canada's popular reputation, which he does not allow to suffer, and hence houses and everything else movable and immovable disappear under a deposit of snow. And he has the wind blow, and when he gets through it is only because the reader does not know what snow is like that cold chills do not run down his back. Yesterday's storm began very early, and it put in more than a nine-hour day. It did not even drop off for lunch and showed no signs of hunger when the dinner hour came around, but kept right along snowing and blowing and blowing and snowing, snowing, until the deposit of the beautiful could be measured by feet. And still it kept on. Every telegraph and telephone pole undertook a contract to act as an auxiliary harp, with a discord attachment, and every sharp corner accepted a position as bass drum to the neighboring pole. And the SNOW WAS FALLING AND WILL CONTINUE. But that did not matter, for there was so much snow going up the greater part of the time that nobody cared whether it was coming down or not. It is wonderful the ambition that a little snow flake has when it has a big powerful wind whispering in its ear. It is like a fake politician, who climbs into the highest places on his own assurance, for it fades away when the winds die away and the sun shines once more brightly. The snow did a good deal of work of an ambitious character yesterday. People who had put away their ""Please do not disturb"" signs hung them out again after erasing the ""Please."" The citizen who, on Monday, paid a man a dollar and a quarter to show up the planks or the stones composing the sidewalk in front of his door went home at dinner time yesterday and crawled over a five-foot snow bank and into a bad temper at his front door. He did that if he lived on the wrong side of the street. If he resided on the right side, he smiled in anticipation of his opposite neighbor's wrath; the ""dog's back"" lay low, but getting in its deadly work ready to greet the chump on his way downtown this morning. Everybody who could stay at home made it the aim of their life to stay there. Everybody else thought a long while about going out, went out, and got in again as quickly as possible. People who rode in the street sleighs wondered why the sleighs did not have doors. This was not a new or original fancy, but it cropped up again after a season of rest. The cabmen had a season of profit and the cabmen's horses a season of agony. The cabmen's horses do not have shelters. There are a number of Americans who come to Montreal for snow. They go away complaining that Canada is a decent sort of country to live in after all. But yesterday they got what they were looking for. The people who know all about storms and other little meteorological disturbances located the storm as the tail-end of the one which has been making life miserable out West. It was attributable to the influence of the sun, said Professor Cox in his lecture before the Unitarian Church association in the Church of the Messiah last evening. The sun's rays have been gathering up the moisture for days past which fell yesterday in the form of snow, and the wind was simply the result of the varying temperature in different parts of the continent. All of which shows that the sun is not always a warm, genial friend. But there is some comfort in the fact that in this instance it did not wreak its malignant influence as severely on Quebec as on some of the Western states. The wind got in some nice work. At two o'clock it was reeling off sixty miles an hour. That was the hour at which people were going or returning from lunch, and some of them are probably ready to swear that it was blowing more. But that was the figure. Snow fell to the depth of 15.9 inches, a remarkably big fall for March. TRAINS WERE PAID BY WEEKLY TIME. Notwithstanding the heavy tracks, the trains on the Grand Trunk were fairly on time. The Ottawa train was an hour late, and the Express from the West came in in two sections, the last at twenty minutes past ten. The Central Vermont was one hour behind time. On the C, he threatened to blow the place up in case of a refusal. Continuing, Mr. Sage said: ""I did not know what to do, for I saw that I was dealing with a murderer."" I handed him back his letter and said to him that I had an engagement which would detain me about two minutes; then I would see to him. He said, ""Then I understand you to refuse?"" I said, ""Oh, no; let me get rid of these men and I will attend to you."" All this time he stood holding the bag of dynamite in his hand and looking at it curiously. He said, ""I rather construe your answer as a refusal."" He then stepped out of the door and the explosion occurred. ""Was Mr. Laidlaw between you and the man?"" was asked. ""Oh, no, sir. He was at the other end of the table."" ""Did you shake hands with him or hold his hand?"" ""No; I never touched him."" Dr. Ludowic Gray, an expert, was then called to tell about the examination of Norcross' brain. Dr. Gray thought that the brain of Norcross showed evidence of trouble, but that there was nothing in the brain to show insanity. The affidavits of the father and mother of Norcross were then read to the jury in order to establish fully the identification. The jury then rendered a verdict that Henry L. Norcross came to his death by dropping a dynamite bomb from his own hand in Plascil Sage's office on December 4th, 1901, and that Richard Norton was accidentally killed in the explosion. THE STORM SOUTH OF US. Syracuse Cut Off From All Communication With Outside Points. Gale In New York. Syracuse, March 10. The wind and snowstorm which set in in this city yesterday afternoon developed into a blizzard which today laid a complete embargo on traffic and business. Areas of snow disclosed the fact that enough snow had fallen during the night to effectively blockade the operation of all the horse and electric cars, notwithstanding an effort was made during the morning to start cars, but in all cases these efforts resulted in failure. The city was virtually left without means of transportation throughout the day. All the country roads leading into the city were so badly drifted that it was an impossibility for farmers to come in, and the city is on the verge of a blank train. The Home Watertown and Ogdensburg railway to Oswego and northern points was abandoned as was also the Syracuse and Ontario. Rochester, March 11. Rochester felt the storm but little; traffic in the city was not impeded at any time and no accidents are reported. In Wayne County the drifts are six feet deep. A Big Gale at New York. New York, March 11. Navigation in the upper and lower bays here today was greatly hindered by the gale and high seas. At Sandy Hook the wind blew at the rate of 50 miles per hour. Hundreds of sailing vessels sought shelter in the harbor."

"18920315","THE IRISH KINDS Irishmen cannot be accused of obstructing, for their own affairs require the greater part of their attention. How to liberate all that money tied up in Paris is the great problem with them. So far the bankers retain possession and have no right to give it up to any of the claimants. Funds must be had for the Parliamentary election and only a few driblets come in from the United States. Both sections of the party are in the same plight; the sinews of war are lacking. With divisions in their ranks, with no supreme leader and no money in bank, their prospects are not so bright as they were in Daniel's palmy days. THE GREAT COAL STRIKE Trade inevitably has a great effect upon politics. Seldom of late years has there been a greater cause of anxiety than on the score of the immense coal strike. It enlarges its area every day and workmen in all sorts of industries are thrown out of employment in consequence. It is one of the most important events that has occurred in England in modern times. Iron works and cotton mills are being closed, furnaces blown out and railroads are discharging their hands. If this disaster had been brought about by capitalists or employers we should now be on the eve of a revolution; but it is entirely owing to workingmen themselves. It is purely and essentially a labor movement, beginning with a section of colliers who desired to raise the price of coal by producing an artificial scarcity. Not only have they caused enormous suffering among the poor during this inclement season, but they are depriving thousands of their own class of the very means of subsistence. In the whole history of the labor world nothing is found equal to this. It will open the eyes of the country to the complete mastery labor has obtained over capital and to the terrible dangers which are involved in the new despotism now firmly established. A NUMBER OF PARLIAMENT QUEER WAYS TO RIDE One company wants to run a car on wheels, and another would operate a moving sidewalk. Chicago, March 12. When bids were opened yesterday for building a railroad in Jackson Park to carry visitors from one end of the World's fair grounds to the other, two peculiar systems of transportation were proposed. Only two bids were received. One of them was from a company that proposed to haul people through the park on an elevated road, the cars of which run on one wheel. The other bid was from a company that proposed to have a series of moving sidewalks, reaching from one end of the fair grounds to the other. According to the specifications, this company would be compelled to build traveling sidewalks more than five miles long. Both bids were taken under consideration. The one-wheeled railroad, or unicycle, is represented in Chicago by Piatt P. Gibbs and Charles T. Palmer. The King Iron Bridge Company, of Cleveland, which has some of the biggest contracts for iron work at the fairgrounds, put up a cheque for $25,000 as a guarantee that the company would live up to the contract. The company agreed to put on thirty motors and the same number of trailers. Each of these would accommodate forty passengers and make the run from one end of the park to the other in fifteen minutes, stopping at twenty-four stations. The company would carry 134,400 passengers in a day of fourteen hours in its one-wheeled cars. The entire length of the intramural railroad, nearly six miles, would be covered in half an hour, on an elevated track. The moving sidewalk, or multiple speed and traction system, is a queer invention. A short section of the sidewalk is now in operation at Jackson Park. It is called the ""multiple speed and traction system"" because there are two sidewalks running parallel, one at the rate of four and the other at the rate of eight miles an hour. If a passenger gets on the slow walk and wants to move along faster all he has to do is step over on the other walk, which moves just twice as fast. The company having this system in charge can haul 40,000 people an hour, or 60,000 a day, and furnish seats for all of them. The company agreed to put in the plant at a cost of $50,000 and give the exposition company 37 percent of the gross receipts after deducting the cost of the structure. It offered to give 50 percent of the receipts for a loop line that would extend over near the lake shore, to a point near the manufacturers building. Representatives of the company said they could bring the moving sidewalk down from the elevated side and run it through stone if such an arrangement was desired. They estimated that the exposition company's share of the profits would be from $500,000 to $600,000. A decision on the question will hardly be reached for several weeks. MURDERED THE TRUTH Ten Years' Penal Resulting for the Crime London, March 12. A large crowd, comprising many persons well known in fashionable society, assembled in the Central Criminal Court, Old Bailey, to listen to the trial of Maithland Francis Moreland, the aged Oxford tutor, who was accused of attempting to blackmail members of the nobility. Among those present were Earl Russell, Lord Rothfield, Lord Griffithwait and the Earl of Chesterfield. When Moreland was arraigned he pleaded guilty of attempting to extort money from Russell, and not guilty to extorting money from the other nobles. The prisoner was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude. Prior to the passing of the sentence Moreland made an earnest appeal to the court for mercy. ""I wish to state,"" he said, ""that I am entirely to blame in this matter. My wife and children are entirely innocent. My wife never read the letters I wrote. I also wish to say in justice to Oxford University that my house was conducted on the strictest moral principles, as university graduates can testify."" While Moreland made his appeal for mercy he sobbed bitterly. He begged the judge to allow him to die in the midst of his family instead of in prison. Justice Smith, before whom the prisoner was arraigned, said that the enormity of Moreland's crime was increased by the letter he had written to Earl Russell's betrothed, Miss Scott. The punishment he might inflict for the offense was penal servitude for life, but that he would not do. Taking everything into account, the prisoner's age and other circumstances, he could not impose a more lenient sentence than ten years' penal servitude. The prisoner was removed from the courtroom to the cells below, all the while weeping bitterly. PENSIONS TO FOREIGNERS United States May Be Paying Nearly $10,000,000 a Year to Aliens Washington, March 12. A resolution which is expected to bring to light some interesting facts relating to pensions has been introduced into the House by Representative Causey of Delaware. It calls on the Secretary of the Interior for information as to the number of pensioners now carried on the rolls who are not citizens or residents of the United States, and the amount of pensions paid them. In speaking of this resolution to your correspondent today, Mr. Causey said he understood the United States was the only country in the world which paid pensions to persons who were not citizens or residents of it. He was informed that our pension rolls now contained the names of thousands of such persons, and that they were paid annually between $8,000,000 and $11,000,000. In view of the fact that Congress was compelled to cut off appropriations for public buildings, rivers and harbors and other necessary improvements demanded by the whole people, Mr. Causey thought the time had come to look into this matter of paying pensions to foreigners with a view to saving a little money in that direction. These foreigners had come to this country during the war, attracted by the large bounties and the liberal pay they could obtain by enlisting in the Northern armies, and when the war was over they returned to their homes in France, Germany or England. They know nothing about our Government, they were inspired by no patriotic motives, and, no doubt, most of them would have joined the Confederate army just as readily if they had obtained the same amount of money. WAYS OF THE NORTHWEST The Berclimer Inquiry and Not Satisfactory Relative Measure WINNIPEG, March 12. A Regina special says Commissioner Berclimer was on the stand in his own defense nearly all day before the Police Commission. During the cross-examination the court had occasion to speak severely on several occasions regarding the evasive answers given by Berclimer and in several instances instructed the clerk not to report the statements made by him. He admitted illegally sentencing Constable Rhinos, but although he knew the sentence was illegal he did not cancel it. He had ordered ball and chain to be put on Deserter Dubois for twelve months. He had sentenced a man to solitary confinement on bread and water for refusing to strip for medical examination until he did.

A movement is on foot to extend the Exhibition grounds two hundred feet by encroaching to that extent on the Mount Royal park grounds. The council should see that such a thing is not permitted.

Too much of the park has been alienated already. The sooner the process of absorption by private interests is stopped the better and the easier. Mr. Tisdale's motion in the House of Commons yesterday is a direct attack on Mr. Gorman's seat. Mr. Gorman was respondent in the Welland election case. Two judges declared his election null and pronounced upon him sentence of personal disqualification.

On the face of the case, it looks as if Mr. Lander's minority should lose another member. The Whig party consoles itself over the drubbing its party got in the House of Commons on Tuesday night by intimating its belief that in his budget speech Mr. Foster lied about the reciprocity negotiations with Mr. Blaine. As the same paper is in the habit of alluding to the majority of the Canadian people who agree with Mr. Foster in political matters as pigs, the Minister of Finance will probably think he has gotten off easy. The United States treasury authorities are concerned about a new counterfeit silver dollar. This peculiar coin is made of genuine silver. Congress' action in authorizing the mint to take 75 cents worth of silver and stamp upon it a hundred-cent mark has suggested to some enterprising coiner that a game of that kind is good enough for two to play at. Canadians take these 75 cent dollars as if the stamp on them meant something. Mr. Bowell announced in Parliament yesterday afternoon that the Government had not given permission to erect an abattoir in this city to slaughter United States cattle in bond for export. He might have added, too, that the Government did not intend to grant any such permission.

In his latest letter to Lord Salisbury, President Harrison speaks of excluding what he calls poachers from Bering Sea if the military force of the United States is required for the task.

"18920509","III, May 8 Thousands of people today visited the inundated portion of this city. The river is still a raging torrent with a roar that can be heard for a long distance. The measurement was taken this morning and registered 21 feet 7 inches, which is a rise of 7 inches in 24 hours. Since then the water has been so rough that no measurement can be made. The waves are high and the greatest damage is to be feared. It is believed that the river will not rise much more, but the strong wind is dashing water so furiously against the bank that many bridges are liable to be washed out. The railroad companies have large forces at work guarding against this. The cattle pens, in which thousands of heads are fed, are a foot under water, and unless it subsides soon they must be removed. The dam at Henry, forty miles above, threatens to go out and should it do so the devastation along the river will be appalling. Many houses have been floated off along the river and dashed to pieces. The residents have lost everything they had and are in a destitute condition. Several warehouses here are surrounded by water and threaten every minute to be carried away. The Mississippi slowly is in if. New Orleans, May 8 The river at this point has remained almost stationary for several days, reaching sixteen feet and six-tenths as the maximum.

"18920512","I IIK KOKTIIWEOT, Special to the Gazette Toronto, May 11, The Winnipeg correspondent of a Toronto firm writes, under date of May 7: A severe snowstorm ten days ago put an effectual stop to seeding operations and it has not been possible to resume them since, and in the Red River valley proper seeding cannot begin again for some days. We estimate that there is now about ten percent of wheat seeded in the Red River valley proper and in the western part of the province and territory from forty to fifty percent. Seeding is now about three or four weeks later and further delay may prove serious. The general tone of the report of threshing wheat that remained in stack is not favorable. A report from one owner of a threshing machine stated that he had been working this weekend and found no wheat that was not out of condition, and by far the greater portion of it was wet. The gluten species of wheat recommended for Manitoba and the Northwest Territories having been condemned by many millers, several milling firms lately were instructed to grind some samples and make tests as to the quality of the flour made from such wheat. To-day samples of bread made from this wheat and also from No. 1 hard were exhibited on 'Change. That made from Bologa wheat was of good color and generally satisfactory. In fact, the difference was hardly apparent when compared with the best hard wheat flour. It is believed, however, that several city bakers have condemned Bologa wheat flour."

"18920628","THE TROLLEY SYSTEM To the Editor of the Gazette: Sir, I have read with considerable interest an article signed ""Humanitarian,"" in your issue of the 21st, on the trolley system. If all he says be true he would surely deserve the appellation he signs himself, but this not being so, I infer he has interests to serve. I have no interest, direct or indirect, in any system of street railroad motor for Montreal or anywhere else. I also confess to ignorance in a technical way of all electrical appliances for street car service or otherwise, but I do claim to have ordinary common sense, and to be able to see results where they are demonstrated so clearly as the application of the trolley system here does. I do not claim that the system has not its drawbacks, but I do say that, compared with the horse service, the latter is not in it. ""Humanitarian"" says there is so much money in the trolley system over the horses that even the press is induced to be silent and suppress reports of accidents. The imputation that the press is bought up is too absurd to be considered, and this statement alone shows the weakness of his argument. That electricity is cheaper, I fancy no one will dispute, else we would not see all progressive cities making the change at a big expense; but if my investigation is worth anything, it shows that while electricity is the cheaper mode of propulsion, yet it is not wholly so, if you take the same number of passengers, but the fact is the companies calculate (and results warrant them in so doing) upon an increase of 30 per cent in business, and, speaking for this city, I have no hesitation in saying the increase is over 30 per cent. ""Humanitarian"" speaks of you soon being a city of 300,000 with 15 miles of trolley system, and draws a fearful picture of the danger to life and limb by your council permitting such an innovation as the trolley. He is simply playing on your fears to serve some personal interest. Until within three years I do not believe there was a city in America worse provided with street rail service than was Milwaukee. We did not even have homes, but long-eared mules were the motors. To-day I doubt if any city surpasses us. We have a population of say 225,000, and an electric trolley system of 25 miles in operation, which will be increased to 45 miles inside a twelve month, or as fast as it can be built. The cost of the change so far is over $1,250,000. ""Humanitarian"" says: ""From every town and municipality in the United States where the trolley system is working there come frequent reports of fatal accidents,"" etc. Now, as a matter of fact, I question if there has been a single fatal accident in Milwaukee since electricity was introduced, over two years ago, and this being so here it's safe to say he is wrong elsewhere. Nor can he say that we have not enough of the trolley to judge by, for there are now ten miles more than he looks to Montreal having. Accidents are always to be expected with any mode of propulsion in a crowded city. Look at the cable cars in Chicago. They have no death-dealing current, and yet scarce a day passes but what we hear of loss of life or limb, and yet no one condemns the system on that account, because it is due to carelessness. I freely admit that when the system was first changed here we had a time to educate the horses to its presence; it produced runaways, but that was to be expected; now, however, the most spirited horse trots alongside the car without worry and under complete control, and we are only reminded of what we did go through by the appearance of a country visiting horse now and again who acts as that class usually do when they first visit a big city where they burn gas and use electricity. ""Humanitarian"" has discovered that rain and a defective rail connection has wrought death to horses. I have no doubt such could be done; but, dwelling with facts, such has never been done here, and I will add that the atmospheric conditions are not to blame for the failure to do so: for it has rained one day and poured the next for the past sixty days. ""Humanitarian"" draws a picture of doctors, undertakers and accident insurance companies being the only ones who should have a word to say of this modern Juggernaut! What rot this is! Equally so his talk of the slaughter of your citizens when the trolley system is substituted, nor does he overlook the increase in nervous diseases entailed upon patrons who use the electric lines; and he even dilates on the effect of the current on their watches, all of which is ample evidence to me that there is more back of his articles than simple humanity. In this connection your readers may say why should I, a stranger, and so far away, concern myself whether Montreal has a trolley or any other system. My reply is: I am no stranger to Montreal. I love the old place, yet am not blind to her handicap position, and having seen the immense advantages gained here by just such a change as Montreal is discussing now, I naturally desire to see her get the same benefit. Outside property has advanced enormously here since the use of electricity, and the presence of the cars with their loads has imparted a metropolitan air to our streets, which was never present with the horse power. I do not discuss the climatic difficulties to overcome in Montreal with snow in winter. We are pretty far North here, and I have seen four months of steady sleighing here; since the advent of the trolley we have had bad snowstorms, but with the use of a snow plough there has not been much delay. While my criticism of accidents, etc., apply directly to Milwaukee, I might also add here my experience extends to Minneapolis, St. Paul and Kansas City with equal force. I am aware that some four years ago a bad accident happened at St. Paul, but as usual the system was not at fault, it was careless motor men."
"18920702","(IHK GAIKJTK MONTREAL SATURDAY JUNE 2 1892 AT BOBSLEY'S The steamship and the railway and the thoughts that shake mankind ITenniJtm One of the saddest chapters in the history is that which records the events of its frontier life, its struggles with Aborigines, its feverish agitation after gold, its eager rush after new locations, richer fields of adventure and better places for settlement. All such chapters are sad, however exciting they may be. They contain the recital of bloody events, of cruel deeds, of awful human suffering, of the failure of high hopes, the blasting of men's and women's lives, the blighting of children's existence, the wreck of all the fair happiness which mocked, as it always mocks, the anticipations of adventurers. The atmosphere of such recitals is always offensive, full of evil words and evil thoughts; full of brutality, of obscenity, of blasphemy, of hatred and of persecution in one form or another. We are always hearing the crack of the pistol, always seeing men fall to death in their crimes; we are always in view of the angling from its tree; and drunkenness, immorality and gambling have been the main characteristics of that frontier life which is the foundation of what we boast of so much as our modern civilization in new countries. Australia and New Zealand had their share of this dreadful life during the early days of discovery, of occupation, of colonization and conquest. The struggles with the natives, the contests with the bushrangers, the wild violence of mining camps, the stampedes of men in search of fortune, all these things made of the early history of these colonies a very sad chapter. In the West Indies and the Spanish Main, the early history afloat and ashore is very bloody. The commissioned vessel and the pirate and privateer had each its own way of spilling human blood. Apart from the military story of the history of many episodes, all the remembrance we have of the earlier days among the Spanish islands is the remembrance of a prolonged shriek of agony. The human suffering that was undergone was an awful satire on the beauty of the scenery, the softness of the climate, the idyllic charm of nature everywhere. But the true history of frontier life must be sought for in the United States. From the early days with which Mr. Parkman has made us familiar to the last stampede into Oklahoma, the history of frontier life in America has been sensational and horrible in the highest degree. California, the Rocky Mountain region, the South during the Ku-Klux outrages, the development of the West, no man can study the events of those phases of American life, these parts of American territory, without being brought face to face with sights and sounds that terrify a student and make him seek in the civilization of today the signs which may indicate the abominations of its origin. There has just been published by Cupples & Co., of Boston, two volumes of a work entitled Vigilantes and Ways, the Pioneer of the Rockies, the Makers and Making of Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, by Nathaniel Pitt Laford, who was himself a pioneer. From the opening pages the book is sensational in character yet characteristic. The dedication adorned with a picture of a skeleton, the legend ""Why doesn't he?"" is to the memory of those unknown pioneers who lost their lives in laying the foundations of the Empire of the new great West, an awful host of dead men surely, a terrible list of the killed in the struggle with ferocious nature and still more ferocious man, an appalling number of men young and old who, in heroism or despair, rushed into the unknown wilderness, never to return to homes desolated and hearts broken by their disappearance. It is true that among the men who perished in the West and the South, the majority were probably not men of good qualities, not good citizens, not to be seriously lamented by anybody. They were the wreckage of society. In justification of the melancholy story he has to tell, the author gives a brief general account of the character of the criminal class which the societies of Vigilantes had to encounter. ""Fear of punishment,"" he says, ""had exercised no restraining influence on the conduct of men who had organized murder and robbery into a steady pursuit. They hesitated at no atrocity necessary to accomplish their guilty designs. Murder with them was resorted to as the most available means of concealing robbery, and the two crimes were generally committed."" The country, rife with canyons, gulches and mountain passes, was especially adapted to their purposes, and the unpeopled distances between mining camps afforded ample opportunity for carrying them into execution. This being the state of things as regards the criminals and the country, the antidote which society, such as it was, set up, was the Vigilance committee. For the existence of this vigilance committee the author sets up a vigorous defense. ""The early vigilantes were the best and most intelligent men in the mining regions. They saw and felt that in the absence of all law, they must become a law unto themselves or submit to the bloody code of the banditti by which they were surrounded and which was increasing in numbers more rapidly than themselves. Every man among them realized from the first the great delicacy and care necessary in the management of a society which assumed the right to condemn to death a fellow-man. And they now refer to the history of all these men who suffered death by their decree as affording ample justification for the severity of their acts. What else could they do? How else were their own lives, and the lives and property of the great body of peaceable miners on the placers to be preserved? What other protection was there for a country entirely destitute of law? No doubt some form of authority was necessary in such a time and among such people; but the discussion of the moral merits of the mode adopted need not be carried on just now. It is striking to note that many of the worst cases mentioned in the two volumes at hand occurred so near our own time as 1862. These volumes are not valuable as literature, but they give a vivid idea of the life led alike by the law-abiding and the lawless in the days of '49. They make us think, also, how very fortunate we are in Canada in having escaped almost wholly from all the disturbances of frontier life. In the early Indian period we had, of course, our own experiences; but from the time that civilization undertook to rule this country, our social development has been generally peaceful. We had a certain amount of difficulty between the Nor West company and Lord Selkirk's settlers; we had a little occasional trouble in the mining regions of British Columbia, easily and bloodlessly kept down by the vigilance of Sir Matthew Begbie, still, in old age, the Chief Justice of the province. We have had our two half-breed rebellions. But, generally speaking, the Northwest of Canada has been developed in a peaceful manner. The pistol and the bowie knife have been absent from our civilization. No blood has been shed. Law has been respected. Order has prevailed. The railway has preceded the settler, and the consequence is that the settler has had at his hand his daily train, his daily paper, his regular post office convenience; he has been within reasonable distance of legal and medical aid and of companionship and social enjoyment. In fact, the settler in the Canadian Northwest has found a society and a civilization ready-made at his door. And, in addition to these safeguards of order, we may note the fact that the settlers in the Northwest of Canada are, generally speaking, people of superior education, whether they come from Europe or from our own provinces. It is a fact to be pleased with and proud of, that no one can ever compile two such volumes as these we have under notice concerning the early development of the Canadian Northwest. Another pioneer volume is at hand, which is worth the attention of Canadians. It is entitled the Life and Writings of John Alfred Poor, and deals with the first International railway and the colonization of New England, etc., by Laura Elizabeth Poor: Putnam, New York. Mr. Poor was a younger son of a family that on its English side counted many distinguished people, and that had the usual experiences of Maine settlers in the wilderness in America. He had good friends as a young man and was admitted ultimately to the Bar; he was associated with Daniel Webster, who was a family friend; and was greatly interested in education, and in public libraries, and, in fact, in every element of civic or national progress. He was very enthusiastically interested in railways from 1834, when the first rails were laid from Boston to Newton. Mr. Poor was then 26 years old, and he used to say that the sight of the starting of the locomotive, which came from England, gave him a pleasurable shock which lasted him all his life. ""In 1843,"" says the authoress, ""he made public his plan for two great railways, both coming from without the State (of Maine) traversing it nearly its whole length, and converging on Portland. The eastern terminus of one road was Halifax, and the western terminus of the other was Montreal."" Mr. Poor was thus the pioneer of the railway enterprises which have a common field of operations in Canada and in Maine. The account of his early struggles, deputations, letters and public addresses is most interesting. For instance, it took him, in 1845, five days to drive, in February, from Portland to Montreal, through a snowstorm which would have knocked the enthusiasm out of most men, but which only increased his determination to get to Montreal in time to prevent the Board of Trade from adopting Boston instead of Portland as the terminus of the Grand Trunk railway. An arrangement was made by which on the arrival of an English steamer at Portland an express train was to start with certain mails, and on the arrival of the steamer at Boston an express was also to start for Montreal. The road was marked with evergreen trees so that no mistakes should be made. The Portland team got in twelve hours ahead with flags flying and amid much cheering, certainly a very interesting recollection. No doubt there are plenty of people in Montreal who remember the occasion, and who will be glad to look up this volume. Miss Poor adds the information not uncommon in the case of pioneers who benefit other people: ""Every generous heart will throb with indignation to know that the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railway company considered five dollars a day for six weeks' time sufficient pay for Mr. Poor's services in procuring the charter; and that for money spent in 1844 in acquiring information, for his frightful illness, and for his enforced idleness during six months Mr. Poor was never paid."" Very interesting are the accounts we read of the railway agitations of 1847 and 1860; and the interest taken in the route from Galway to Halifax, in the fixing of Louisburg as an Atlantic terminus, in the contests between Halifax and St. John regarding making the Bay of Fundy, by steamer, part of the schemes on foot. These were the days when Latin was quoted by business men, and Charles Sumner quoted from Tibullus to prove that the golden age was coming now, which Mr. Gray, of St. John, terrifically denounced the Bay of Fundy. General Dearborn proclaimed that in five years from 1850, he would ride over the rail from Portland to Halifax and embark for Galway, Holyhead and London! There is an account of Joseph Howe's visit to England in 1851 and his visit to Portland the same year to advocate the Quebec and Halifax route; of the visit of Sir Francis Hincks in 1852 to England on railway affairs; of the adoption of Portland as a winter port of the Grand Trunk; of the building of the European and North American railway, though Mr. Poor did not live to see the completion of this last favorite project. Mr. Poor is here said to have been a man of splendid physique as he was unquestionably a man of many attainments, and of consuming energy. The volume contains essays and lectures on a variety of subjects on railway subjects, ""the Zollverein,"" ""Colonization of America,"" ""Sir Ferdinando Georges,"" etc.; all of which are most interesting and even valuable. All who are interested in the history of railway development will be interested in this volume, though the subject of it passed away in 1871. He must have been a familiar figure to many Montrealers twenty-five years ago, - M"

He will say that increased facilities are more needed in New York than in any other city in the United States. The Postmaster-General will not respond to the demand for one cent postage. He finds that such a course at this time would be unwise. He finds it would be a loss of something like $20,000,000 or $25,000,000, and it would be some time before the increase of business would make good the deficit. He will call attention to the fact that the postal service of today has to perform a considerable amount of work at an absolute loss. There is a loss on newspapers alone of from $12,000,000 to $14,000,000 annually, and Mr. Wanamaker will call attention to those matters, so that the service may be given credit for the work done. The proposition to reduce ocean postage from 6 to 2 cents will not be endorsed by Mr. Wanamaker. He thinks domestic postage should be reduced first. The progress of the postal service, Mr. Wanamaker will say, is tending in four directions. He believes the present generation will live to see all of them in successful operation. They are: The country free delivery service; house to house collection; the postal telegraph and the postal telephone. He believes the Government could give the people ten cent telegrams and three cent telephone messages, and not lose money by the transaction. The Parliament Is Defeated New York, October 5 A sight rarely witnessed on the waters of Long Island Sound now was seen this morning in a race between two of the mammoth steamboats that come to this city. The race was between the Puritan, of the Fall River line, and the Richard Peck, of the New Haven line. It was a test between different systems of marine machinery and to determine the relative qualities of the compound beam engine, that goes with the Dido-wheeler, and the modern triple expansion engine that drives the twin-screw propeller. The Puritan is a side-wheeler, one of the largest floating sound palaces, and the Richard Peck is the first screw steamboat to go on the service on the Sound. She was built on the Delaware and has only been in service a month. The agents of the Fall River line sent a challenge to the people of the New Haven to test the speed of their fast boats. The challenge was accepted and it was decided that the race should be between a point near Stratford shoals to Fort Schuyler, a distance of 50 miles. The Peck left New Haven at 10:30 o'clock last night. When she got out into the Sound she slowed up and waited until the Puritan came up and the boats were stem and stem. Then they started, and for the first fifteen minutes neither seemed to gain an inch on the other. The passengers on each boat shared in the excitement, and though the weather was cold and stormy and rain was falling most of them remained on deck. Finally the Richard Peck began to forge slowly ahead. Gradually the distance between the two boats increased and at last the Puritan was left far astern. When the Richard Peck passed Fort Schuyler this morning the Puritan was a mile and a half astern, and had lost the race. The Georgia Election, October 5 A colored man, was shot and killed by Dan Bowles at the Poorhouse precinct, five miles from this city. A number of Democratic negroes, led by Bowles, were marching to the polls, when eight or ten Third party negroes, led by Horton, rushed into the Democratic line. Horton ran up and struck Bowles twice, knocking him to his knees. He had a hand on Bowles' collar and was preparing to strike him a third time when Bowles drew a pistol and shot him through the heart. A coroner's jury composed of Democrats and two Third party men returned a verdict of justifiable homicide. Richmond County will go Democratic by over 4,000 majority, Governor Norchen's majority in the Tenth district will be probably 4,000. This is Congressman Watson's district and is recognized as the stronghold of the Third party in Georgia. Norton's majority over Peek indicates that the district will go Democratic in November. The Democrats carry the state by a large majority. Think the Company Want Them Back Homestead, Pa, October 5 About 250 feet of the mill fence, or as it is known here, the Palisade, to Fort Brick, was torn down yesterday afternoon by workmen of the firm, and last evening the outer mill yard from the restaurant to the company's stores was opened. The remainder of the fence along Eighth Avenue will be removed today and the company's houses inside the yard will be opened to the road. The company's officials say the reason for tearing down the fence is that so far as they are concerned the strike is practically over, and they desire operations to continue as they did in May. Several hundred of the locked-out men gathered to watch the operation. They profess to look upon it as an invitation to return to work. To Fight Against the Whiskey Trust Chicago, October 5 The Whiskey trust, known in legal circles as the Cattle Feeding and Distilling Company, is not, if Samuel Woolner, of Peoria, can prevent it, going to have a monopoly of the market much longer. Mr. Woolner has plans for a mammoth distillery in preparation and it will be in operation in four months. The output will be 25,000 gallons of spirits per day. The trust will turn out six times this amount. Want Better Wages Baltimore, Md, October 5 The telegraphers of the Baltimore and Ohio railway who belong to the Order of Railway Telegraphers are on the tip-toe of expectancy as to what action will be taken by the railroad authorities upon the submission to them of a new schedule of wages. This schedule was agreed upon at the recent meeting at Pittsburgh. The schedule contains a request for higher salaries, shorter hours and a rule for promotion by merit and not by seniority. The proposed schedule only affects Baltimore and Ohio operators. Chinamen Feed the Moon New York, October 5 Yesterday was a holiday in Chinatown. Twenty thousand years ago King Pon Ku Wong was enamored of the beauty of the moon, and on the fifteenth day of the eighth month made an offering to her. He found a strange and wonderful cake from rice paste, sliced pig, sweet nut, sugar and spices, and when the moon rose in all its glory set it before her. Since that time Pon Ku Wong's devotional offering has been observed. At the Chinese club and at the Freemasons' hall Chinese bands made the night hideous. Colder Than Canada Franklin, Pa, October 5 The thermometer fell rapidly this morning and increasing coldness as the day progressed brought with it a blustery snowstorm at noon which soon covered the ground, prevailing along the whole mountain from here to Audenried. Below the weather is not so cold and the snow disappears almost as rapidly as it falls. At 2:40 this afternoon snow fell thickly for several minutes, melting as it touched the ground. Might Have Been a Calamity Poughkeepsie, October 5 The steamer Emellino, with an excursion party on board from this city, including members of the Young America Hose Company and the Niagara Steamer Company, struck a rock while coming out of Catskill Creek this evening and sank immediately. All on board were safely taken off. The carriage of the hose company went down with the boat, and the members of the Capitol band, of Albany, lost their instruments. An Ohio Kidnapping Columbus, Ohio, October 5 Sam Bangs, Ed Bangs and Quincy Van Tassel kidnapped Lillie Bennett today. Edna Bennett wounded Van Tassel with a gun. Lillie was carried off. The girls were alone, respectable, and reside here. Bangs wanted to marry Lillie, but was opposed by her sister. A Passenger Trainer Ashore New York, October 6 The steamship Hamana, of the Compania Transatlantic Espanole, which sailed from here Saturday last for Havana with twelve passengers and a full cargo is ashore on the Florida coast. The steamer is in a dangerous position and the passengers are safe. The Cook Was Drowned Finn Island, October 5 The fishing schooner George Moon, bound for New York, was capsized at 10 p.m., three miles off shore. The crew with the exception of the cook, who was drowned, were rescued by the schooner Elsie Harris. The Florida Election Jacksonville, Fla, October 5 The latest returns up to 11 p.m. show that Mitchell (Democrat) has carried the state by fully 20,000 majority and that Baskin (People's) carried but one county, and that by a majority of only 15. A Canadian Commits Suicide New York, October 5 John B. Cook, 40 years old, a native of Gait, Ont, committed suicide this morning at his boarding place, 22 Irving Place, by shooting himself through the head. Financial troubles were the cause.

"18921019","Y Times It's like the pitcher that goes early to the well day after day, day after day, and then all of a sudden gets smashed. That's my opinion of the Electoral college system by which we choose our Presidents, said a man who was talking with some friends in an uptown club. The question of the reliability of the present method of electing the President had been raised by a young man who had asked for information. What's to prevent a presidential elector from voting another ticket than the one that it was understood that he would vote when he was placed in nomination by his party? the young man had enquired. To this question one of the party had replied: If you mean to ask me if there is any law to prevent such a performance, I can promptly answer in the negative. There's no provision of law relating to the electors, either constitutional or statutory, which takes cognizance of parties, or recognizes a party's right to instruct a presidential elector how he shall vote. If you'll take this book, it's the Constitution of the United States and read beginning right here, you'll see what the law is. The young man had taken the book and read as follows: Each state shall appoint in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in Congress: but no Senator or representative or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States shall be appointed an elector. The electors shall meet in their respective state and vote by ballot for president and vice-president, one of whom at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as president and in distinct ballots the persons voted for as vice-president, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as president and of all persons voted for as vice-president and of the number of votes for each. There that's all there is of the law, the person who had undertaken to answer the young man's question had said, breaking off the reading in the middle of the sentence. The plain English of the matter is that a man who is chosen a presidential elector is bound by no law except the law of honor. Here's New York with thirty-six electors. When the time shall come for the state's vote to be cast, each one of the thirty-six electors who shall have been chosen at the state election may, if he likes, vote for his own grandfather provided the old man is eligible, and there is no law under which he could be arraigned for a betrayal of the trust imposed upon him by his party. And this thing has been going on ever since the founding of the Government. Yes, sir. And has there never been an instance of betrayal of his party by an elector? Never to my knowledge, and I don't believe there ever will be. I don't agree with you, interrupted another of the party, and then he made the speech comparing the electoral college system to the pitcher that is sure to be smashed sooner or later while journeying to and from the well. This speech was followed by an explanation. I don't believe, said the speaker, that the thing is absolutely safe. Let me put a case. Suppose that this year the result of the general election should be such that the addition of a single electoral vote to those already secured for a certain candidate would elect him. Could it be got? Is it impossible that one of those electors chosen on the nomination of the Alliance might be bought? Look at the case a moment. Here am I, a third-party man, chosen a presidential elector. What shall I do with my vote? Our candidate for the presidency is out of the question. Somebody comes to me and says: Look here, Mr. Brown, we want your vote for our candidate, and are willing to pay for it. Now, I don't care much who shall be President. Would I sell if I could get $100,000? Think what that would mean for me. Comfort for my family and myself all my life. No more worry about meeting bills. No more sleepless nights devoted to thoughts of that old mortgage. No more days of tedious and wearing toil in the field and woods. Well, suppose that I say no to the tempter, and that then he doubles up and offers me $200,000 what then? Or if he adds still more, will I finally yield? Who can answer a question like that? Take into consideration, mind you, that the negotiations would not be publicly conducted. That's one thing. Another is that if I wished to vote for someone other than the third-party candidate I could easily make a statement that would put it out of people's power to fasten venality upon me. Perhaps if I were influential in my state and a shrewd manipulator I could get a body of my political friends to pass a resolution calling on me to do the thing that I had bargained to do. People might have their suspicions, but what would that amount to? But the fact that such a thing has never happened since the Government was founded is almost a guarantee that it never will happen, suggested the young man who had started the conversation. Yes, admitted the other, it's just that, and no more. It's almost certain that the will of the people will not be subverted by the corrupting of a presidential elector, but it's not absolutely certain, as it should be. In a matter of so great importance, it is absurd that so loose a method of procedure should be allowed. We've got along well enough heretofore, but there's no knowing how soon the thing may happen which the provisions of the Constitution plainly invite. At this point an old gentleman who had been taking no part in the conversation asked to be allowed to say a few words. You gentlemen seem to take it for granted, said he, that every man who has been chosen a presidential elector from the time of Washington down has done precisely what he has been commissioned to do by the people who have elected him. You are wrong in this. If you will take the trouble to run back to the story of the election of 1824, you will find that there were four candidates for the presidency for whom electoral votes were cast: John Quincy Adams, William H. Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and Henry Clay. New York was entitled to 35 electoral votes, and the electors were chosen by the legislature after a struggle of five days. Adams got 25 of the electors, Clay got 7, and Crawford got 4. Now, had the votes of these electors been cast according to the understanding prevailing when the electors were chosen, the vote of the electoral college would have been: Jackson, 62; Adams, 83; Crawford, 40; Clay, 40. As it was three of the Clay electors deserted him and went, one each, to Adams, Jackson, and Crawford, and by that act made Clay the fourth man in the vote of the electoral college, and ineligible as a candidate before the House, which had to do the electing, no candidate having received a majority of the electoral vote. Some people say that if these three New Yorkers had not deserted Clay his name would have surely gone to the House instead of Crawford's, and they profess to believe that, had it gone to the House, John Quincy Adams would not have been elected President. But however that may be, one thing is clear; it is that the three men voted contrary to the expectations of those who elected them. Why one of them, as I said, gave Jackson a vote, who was not even a candidate before the Legislature of New York when the electors were chosen. For another instance, I'll point you to the election of 1800, when one of the Maryland electors did not vote. There's no knowing how he would have voted had he taken part in the election, but he might have voted in such a way as to have obviated one of the most notable political contests ever known in this country, the contest in the House between Burr and Jefferson. Burr, you remember, was a candidate for president, too, and got just the same number of votes as Jefferson. When the contest went into the House the Federalists undertook to make Burr president, and thirty-six ballots were taken before Jefferson, who was the people's choice for president, secured the election. Now, suppose that the Maryland man had voted for Jefferson for president; don't you see the excitement of that long contest would have been avoided? Eight years later a Kentucky elector failed to vote, but his not voting was inconsequential. That was the year that Madison was elected the first time, and he had an overwhelming majority in the Electoral college. Come down to the time of Monroe's election and you'll find that three electors died before the time for voting came, but here again the loss of three votes in the Electoral college was a matter of small amount, for Monroe had all the votes cast except one, which was cast by a New Hampshire man who doomed it due to the memory of Washington that no president after him should share in the honor of a unanimous election. In 1804, I believe, Nevada lost one of her votes in the Electoral college by the death of an elector. That was the year that Lincoln got 212 votes to McClellan's 21. I can think of still another interesting occurrence. In 1860 the electors of Wisconsin were prevented by a severe snowstorm from reaching the capital of their state in season to give their votes on December 8, as required by law, and met and voted on December 4. There was a long and earnest debate in both House and Senate as to whether the Wisconsin votes should be counted. In the result it made no difference whether they were counted or not, but there was a principle at stake. The votes were counted, but perhaps, if the standing of the candidates had been such that these votes would have been decisive, the people of Wisconsin would have been disfranchised. I dare say other instances could be cited of the failure of the electors to do what they were chosen to do, but these that I have already given are enough, it seems to me, to sustain the contention of my friend here that our way of choosing the president is a poor one. It's objectionable because there is danger that the electors may betray their trust, that by act of God they may be prevented from doing their duty again, that partisans in the body which makes the count may take advantage of blunders. There is no excuse for such a system in these days. We ought to get rid of it."
"18921025","8-T1115 GAZIOT14 MONTREAL, TUESDAY OCTOBER 25 1892, GERMANY'S MILITARY BILL, An Official Announcement of the Details of the Bill, THE STRIKE AT CARMAUX, Regliun' lok Nrliin Mr, OlnaNlono,cture-rJieUl Alleged Coulee, slowTo tVd tho t'aaro, Berlin, October 24, Official details of the new army bill were published today, the peace effective force from October 1, 1893, to March 31, 1899, is fixed at 492,008. The service of the infantry is generally reduced to two years. The adoption of this measure is necessary because the former military preponderance of Germany has gone. The war strength of France is stated at 4,053,000 and of Russia at 4,550,000. When the reorganization under the bill is completed the German army will have attained a strength of 4,400,000, while France will not be able to exceed her present strength. The bill retains the power of the military authorities to keep men in the ranks until they have completed their third year of service. This will be known as a punishment for offenses under the military code. The PrtNeon the Bill, Berlin, October 21, The Reichsminister tonight declares that the Cologne Gazette obtained its information on the Army bill by unlawful means. The capital expenditure will be 60,800,000 marks and the annual expenditure 64,000,000 marks. The bill provides for an increase of 2,138 commissioned officers, 11,857 non-commissioned officers, 72,073 privates and 6,130 horses. London, October 25, The Berlin correspondent of the News says: The enormous demands of the military bill explain the desire of the Government to keep it secret. If Dr. Windthorst had been alive it is probable that the bill would never have been introduced. Now, however, it is likely to be passed. The Le Monde declares that the bill is unacceptable. It supposes that the sum mentioned in the bill does not include the cost of barracks, etc. It also publishes statistics intended to prove that while France provides for an annual contingent of 230,000 recruits that number is never obtained and therefore that France has reached the limit of her military strength. The Standard's Berlin correspondent learns that the German Government will argue that the military bill is intended to remedy the system by which thousands of married men and fathers are obliged to bear the first shock of war, leaving their families a burden on the nation, while 100,000 young men fitted for service are annually relegated to the supplementary reserve because their admission to the active army would swell the peace effective beyond the legal limits, and because the ""cadres,"" as at present organized, cannot admit so many. Nelll's Alleged Confession, London, October 24, The alleged confession of Neill, the poisoner, is said to have been made in confidence before he was sentenced. He has seen no one but the jail officials since sentence was passed. Neill's counsel are hopeful of getting from America affidavits which will aid Home Secretary Asquith in relieving the prisoner on the ground of humanity, resulting from the use of narcotics. Such evidence is likely to be counteracted, however, by the results of medical investigation. It has been learned that Neill was exceedingly popular among women of light reputation on account of his generosity. He is in great trouble now about his diet; he only stipulates that he shall have the full allowance of beer. He eats sparingly and has become restless, sullen and irritable. English and American firms of showmen are clamoring for his possessions. The statement that Neill has confessed that he murdered the Clover, Marsh and Shrivell girls is denied by the lawyers who defended him. Rough Weather at Sea, Queenstown, October 24, Incoming vessels report having encountered terrific weather. Strong easterly winds caused the Cunard steamship Aurania to be several hours overdue. The barque Chieftain, from San Francisco, reports that she encountered a fearful gale on September 29. She was washed by huge seas until she almost foundered. The steamer Alaska, from New York, reports that she encountered terrific weather. On some days of the voyage her officers considered her in a dangerous position. One of her engines was stopped for seventy minutes. Alaska's passengers report that they had a terrible voyage. Head winds were encountered throughout the passage. On October 20th the wind blew a perfect gale and the sea ran very high. Deceived the Lord Mayor, LONDON, October 24, According to custom Baron Herschell, the Lord Chancellor, received Stuart Knill, Lord Mayor-elect of London, in the House of Lords today. Mr. Knill was accompanied by Sheriff Hens, Sheriff Wilkins and other city officials. The Lord Chancellor commented upon the fact that the election of Mr. Knill had been received with determined hostility in certain quarters owing to the faith in which he believed. The Lord Chancellor said that, undoubtedly, the terms were passed when it was impossible for a Catholic to hold office without compromising his religious convictions. By the battle of religious liberty it has been fought and won and the creed in which a man believed was no barrier to privileges, rights and honors. The Carmaux Strike, Iraklis, October 24, The striking miners in Carmaux held a meeting yesterday at which Duquerrie presided. A resolution was unanimously adopted declaring that the men would remain on the defensive and continue the strike. Several Anarchists arrived at Carmaux yesterday. Their object is to conduct an agitation in favor of prolonging the crisis. London, October 25, The Standard's Paris dispatch says: Bands of strikers have been parading the streets of Carmaux today singing the 'Carmagnole' and other songs. Anarchists are fomenting disorder and seeking to induce the strikers to reject Premier Loubet's decision unless he grants all their demands. That Pleuro-Pneumonia, London, October 24, The Board of Agriculture is coming to the opinion that it may have acted a little too quickly in the case of the Canadian cow alleged to have been suffering from pleuro-pneumonia. The animal had been at Dundee a fortnight before the alleged disease was discovered. Not only the cow in question, but 250 others were destroyed. The opponents of the livestock trade are making the most of the incident, and they advance the opinion that Canada should engage in the dead meat trade. The Live Stock Journal thinks that the disease may have been introduced to Canada through the Northwest boundary, while the Standard says the beast probably came from the United States. The Dahomeyan Campaign, Paris, October 24, Col. Dodds, commander of the French forces in Dahomey, estimates that 15,000 Dahomeyans have been killed in the encounters that have taken place thus far in the campaign. The army of the king, he says, has been half destroyed and the remainder is in a demoralized condition. The manager of a factory in Dahomey reports that a German firm has supplied King Béhanzin with 4,000 quick-firing rifles and three field pieces in exchange for slaves, the last batch of whom were delivered on May 6th. The manager adds that the shipment of those slaves occurred under the personal supervision of the German consul. Meyerily-Seventeen Thousand Have Died, PETROGRAD, October 24, Since the outbreak of the cholera in the Russian dominions there have been in the lieutenantcy of the Caucasus 125,000 cases of the disease and 65,000 deaths. In Saral off there have been 31,000 cases and 11,000 deaths, and in St. Petersburg 3,300 cases and 1,150 deaths, making in these three districts alone a total of 150,300 cases and 77,000 deaths. Three weeks ago the disease broke out in Warsaw and since that time twenty deaths have occurred. Betrothed to the Czarowitch, London, October 24, The Chronicle's Vienna correspondent says that the Czarowitch will be formally betrothed at Athens to his cousin, Princess Marie of Greece. The Czar, as the head of the Orthodox Greek church, has granted the dispensation, which is necessary on account of the consanguinity of the parties to the contract. The Chronicle's St. Petersburg correspondent says that Turkish objections prevented the Czarowitch journeying to Athens by way of the Dardanelles. The Argentina Revolution, Buenos Aires, October 24, Fighting of a desultory character continues in the province of Santiago del Estero. Another revolt involving the districts in three provinces of Corrientes has broken out and the Government is sending forces there to quell the insurrection. Congress has passed a resolution in favor of the Government reinstating Kojas as governor of Santiago del Estero. They Think It Kind of Him, London, October 24, The Daily Telegraph, referring to Mr. Cleveland's action in refraining from attending the ceremonies in Chicago on account of Mrs. Harrison's illness, says: Mr. Cleveland's chivalry is warmly appreciated in England, where sincere sympathy is felt for President Harrison, and an earnest wish is entertained that the bitter cup may yet pass from his lips. The Cholera Alarm, Calais, Paris, October 24, The town of Calais has been officially declared to be infected with cholera. Three cases of the disease and one death have occurred there since Friday. Five cases and three deaths have occurred in the adjacent village of Barrete. Five persons died in Marseilles today from what is supposed to have been cholera. The Duke of Roxburgh Dead, London, October 23, The Duke of Roxburgh died this morning. Sir James H. Innes-Ker, Duke of Roxburgh and Earl Innes of the United Kingdom, was born on September 5, 1830. He married Lady Anne Spencer Churchill, sister of the Duke of Marlborough, in 1874. His heir is his eldest son, Henry John, Marquis of Bowmont. To Buy Uruguayan Stock, London, October 24, A syndicate has been formed for the purpose of taking over the whole 175,000 of Uruguayan stock belonging to the Baring estate. The liquidators of Baring Brothers & Company are considering the offer made for the stock by the syndicate. The price offered is considerably above the current quotation. Fenians to be Released, London, October 24, The Fenians Mullin and Dowling, who are serving sentences in the Marlboro jail, are about to be released. Mullin was convicted of complicity in the murder of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke, undersecretary in Dublin, May 6, 1882. Dowling was convicted of killing a policeman. News to America, London, October 25, The Chronicle's Rome correspondent says: Monsignor Satolli has gone to New York to preside at a secret session of archbishops on November 16, at which he will be the only person present who is not an American. On his return he will make a detailed report to the Pope. A Well Known Composer Dead, Berlin, October 24, Robt Franz, the well-known composer, died today. Mr. Franz was a native of Halle, Germany, and was a well-known songwriter, his publications in this field alone numbering 280 for the single voice alone. He has also edited the works of Bach and Handel. To Rename Immigration Traffic, Hamburg, October 24, The Hamburg-American Packet Company will resume its steerage traffic to the United States on November 8th. Its steamer Gotland will convey from Stettin a full complement of steerage passengers. Russians, Poles and Bohemians, however, will not be taken. A Rush to Hear Mr. Gladstone, London, October 24, Mr. Gladstone spent the day at the deanery, Oxford University. This afternoon he delivered a lecture on Medieval Oxford at the Sheldon Theatre. In the struggle to obtain seats several of the undergraduates were injured and many fainted. Buried Her in the Cellar, London, October 24, The coroner's inquest in the case of Mrs. Mellor, of Oldham, wife of a mill hand of that town, whose body was found buried in the cellar of her home near Glasgow, resulted in a verdict of murder against her husband, Joseph Mellor. Cold Weather In England, London, October 24, The cold weather continues and is causing much suffering among the poor. Snowstorms prevailed in the Midland counties of England yesterday, and in Wales the mountains for many miles look as though it was midwinter.

"18921029","AN IMPORTANT MOVE: America to Have a Papal Consistory to Have Appeal to Home, Philadelphia, October 27. It is announced that one of the principal reasons for the visit to this country of the Papal Legate, Archbishop Satolli, and Mgr O'Connell, president of the American College at Rome, is the establishment here of a consistory court to try and settle disputes arising between bishops and priests without their appealing to Rome as is now done in such cases. The legate is vested with ample authority by the Pope as to the manner in which the court shall be established, and Mgr O'Connell is to be its secretary. The consistory, when established, will hold its sittings in the Catholic University at Washington, and it is expected that the first case to come before it will be the matters now under dispute between Bishop Brennan, of Texas, and a number of the priests of his diocese. Dr Mills Reads a Paper, Philadelphia, October 27. At today's session of the American Humane Association convention the secretary read a paper from Elbridge T. Gerry, of New York, upon the necessity of laws to provide for the care of children apparently neglected. The paper condemned the folly and vanity of parents in forcing upon the public so-called prodigies, little tots, etc., as well as upon the depraved taste that induces the public to lend encouragement to child performers in theatres. ""It is in a sense a prostitution of the dramatic art,"" he declared, ""a leveling down of high sentiments to feeble imitations."" The physical, moral and social ills visited upon children on the stage at night were also dwelt upon. Prof Wesley Mills, of Montreal, presented a paper on the subject, ""The Preparation of the Human Mind for Human Ideas and Feelings."" He advised the keeping of at least one animal by every family and the visitation of animal shows and zoological gardens. Other papers on ""Baby Farming,"" ""Uniform Legislation to Protect Children,"" and ""Child Insurance and Factory Laws,"" were read.

The officers were in hot pursuit in the instant, but thinking that after all he might escape them, they fired shots in the air with magic effect. The man dropped to the ground, as though he had been shot. Then the officers took him to the station on Seigneurs street where he remained for a few hours. At the Police court yesterday he pleaded guilty to burglary and was sent to the Court of Queen's Bench. William Ashley, yesterday, the police authorities heard more about the greatest crank on earth. The Chief had hoped that communications were stopped for 4 o'clock, and was not a little surprised to receive another letter yesterday. The writer was not Ashley. It will be remembered that on Tuesday Ashley's trunk was received at the Central station and as there was $2.75 to be paid on it, the Chief ordered its return to the Express company. The trunk was light, and probably contained a newspaper. There was no key for it, but the Chief got yesterday in a letter written from the Insane asylum at Winnipeg. The letter was addressed to William Ashley, care Chief of Police, Montreal, and it is evident that the man is making strides for this city. The Initial Storm. The first snowstorm of the season took place yesterday. For twelve straight hours the 'beautiful' fell in solid flakes, and then it turned to a downhill of half sleet half rain that made the streets almost ankle-deep in melting slush. Six horses had to be put on the street cars between six and seven o'clock and every sewer grating in the city seemed to be blocked up. To cross the street involved a plunge into the icy flood that chilled one to the very bone and the passers-by were few and far between. It was a severe test for the new electric service, but they stood it well and it looks as if Mr. Everett's promise to run them all winter would be fulfilled."
"18921108","S deputy-marshals sworn in by Davenport and Jacobus that they are not expected to go behind the guard rails in the booths unless necessary to discharge some duty imposed upon them by the statutes of the United States. When necessary they have the right to go anywhere about the polls or ballot boxes in discharge of duty. But ordinarily it will only be necessary that they be about outside ready for any emergency that may arise. If they obey instructions, as no doubt they will, their presence will simply be conducive to good order and a fair election. That is a marked come down from the tone of Davenport's talk last week. Peace is further assured by the stand taken by Police Superintendent Byrnes. Relative to the duties of the United States supervisors, marshals and deputy marshals, he says: I have only to say that they are acting under warrant of law issued by the United States authorities, and I assume that these officers are just as anxious to preserve the peace, protect the integrity of the ballot box, and enforce the rights of lawful voters as the police force must necessarily be. It should be a common cause between both departments to have the law fairly and impartially enforced, irrespective of politics or party factions. If any officer acting by authority of the United States is guilty of any violation of law, I do not doubt that his superiors will see to it that he is promptly punished. It is evident to me that a public officer in the performance of his duties should take the uniform and impartial enforcement of law as his political creed on election day. Netting on the Revolt, New York, November 7. Late tonight the Republicans made a good raid upon the betting center at the Hoffman House in accordance with a preconcerted policy. A great deal of money was bet on Indiana at the odds of 10 to 7 in favor of Cleveland carrying the state. There were several bets on local politics at enormously long democratic odds. There was considerable betting on the general presidential result at even money and at 9 to 10 in favor of Cleveland. James Mahoney put in various sums up to 10 o'clock an aggregate amount of $100,000 on the election of Cleveland, the majority of which was placed at the odds of 10 to 9. There were numerous bets during the evening and up to a late hour at the odds of 1 to 1.50 in favor of Cleveland carrying the state of New York. The entire police force will go on duty at 6 o'clock this evening and will remain continuously on duty until Wednesday morning, with only brief intermissions for meals. As for sleep, that is not to be thought of for thirty-six hours. Even with the entire force on duty, said the superintendent this morning, the police department would find itself short of men for the duties on hand. The law requires that there shall be two policemen at each polling place, and the number of polling places is now 1,137, an increase of about 200 above the number at the last election held here. In addition to the two at each polling place, there will be more policemen at certain polling places, where, in the judgment of the superintendent or the captain of the precinct, they may be needed. A light vote may be polled, Chicago, November 7. The indications are that a light vote will be polled in many portions of the Northwest on account of today's storms. It is not expected to have as much effect in the cities and towns as upon the farmers, who will be compelled to travel several miles to a polling place. Despatches from St. Cloud, Northfield, Redwood Falls and other points in Minnesota report a heavy gale, attended by severe coldness, and in Wisconsin similar conditions prevail. The roads are reported to be impassable, and their condition such as will prevent the casting of a heavy vote. Menominee, Mich., reports a heavy northwest gale, accompanied by a blinding snowstorm, and a condition of roads such as will render a light vote probable. The same information comes from many points in Northern Iowa. Will Burn the Town, Atlanta, Ga., November 7.

The President continued to receive the returns until after midnight. The weather was fine. New York, November 8, The weather throughout the whole union was generally fine and pleasant and no doubt contributed to a great extent to the heaviness of the vote generally polled. In the New England states it was generally reported as clear and pleasant and this too applies to New York state. The central had a cloudy opening of the day but in many places the clouds passed away and the remainder of the day was bright and warm. Down South the weather was springlike. In the western states it was generally cool, in some instances cold, but there were no snowstorms, blizzards and but a few minor rain storms to impede the march of the electors to the polls. The weather did its duty. The New Ballot, In many states the system known as the Australian ballot system and which is an adaptation of the Canadian system was used for the first time and generally found to work very well, although in some localities complaints came in thickly. It is generally thought, however, that most of the difficulty lay in the want of experienced poll clerks. A good many ballots were spoiled in New York City, but it was not long before an improvement was noticed. In some of the states where, besides presidential electors, state officials were elected the ballots assumed most generous proportions. This was the case particularly in Illinois and Pennsylvania. The new system is, on the whole, a great success. Where They Voted, Whitb Tiains, N"

Cholera Haven't I been a great help to you newspaper people? Editor Well, I fancy honors are easy. M. Hons (itual Judges, Mubhi's, GrantUain and Montgomery, Toronto won the toss, and, of course, chose to kick with the wind, which also happened to be downhill, and McGill kicked off. The Toronto players soon had the ball around the visitors' 26-line, but Matthewson cleverly got the ball out of a scrimmage, and passed it to Gaudot, who made a capital run and gave matters a different look, and was much applauded for a very good bit of play just when it was most needed by his side. This rather turned the tables in favor of McGill for a time. Boon Bunting got the ball and carried it to the other end of the field, where he scored a penalty goal. With a score of four to nothing in favor of the home team the play was continued near McGill's 30 line till McFarlane broke through, and after another scrimmage McGill secured a touch in goal. The game now stood 4 to 1 in favor of the home team, and White, of the 'Varsity, got a try shortly and soon after Brunei was compelled to rouge. Then the half-time whistle blew, and the score stood 6 to 1 in favor of 'Varsity. That was the last point scored by the home players. When the teams began the second half play the Montreal players were enjoying the advantages of wind and ground, which aided their opponents in the first half of the match. The McGill men played a splendid game all round, and Toronto forwards played a remarkably strong game, but their halves were a little weak. The two teams, however, were well matched so far as strength went. The Toronto men could not make much headway against the wind, and it was probably just as well for the visitors they chose the advantages of field and weather in the first half, for the Montreal players were fresh when they had these advantages to contend against, while both teams needed all the advantage they could get in the second half, as it was hard work playing in the snow, and the men were pretty well tired out when they went upon the field for the second half. Shortly after starting in on the second half McGill scored a rouge, and ten minutes later by capital play McFarlane got a try, which McDougall converted, making the score Toronto, 9; McGill, 8. Then the play got very warm and the spectators became very enthusiastic, and the match altogether got intensely interesting. Another rouge was shortly made for McGill, bringing the score up even, 9 to 9, with but a few minutes to play. Neither side could score in the time that was left to complete the match, and the game was declared a draw. Montreal's Defeat (From our Own correspondent) Toronto, November 10 The great match of the day, and indeed the great match of the season, was played on the Rosedale Athletic grounds between the Montreal and Osgoode Hall teams for the championship of Canada. The result of last night's snowstorm was not quite so much felt in this as in the inter-Varsity match, because there was more time and better facilities to improve the condition of the ground. Still, it was played under considerable difficulties. There were nearly 2,000 people on the ground to witness the great match, many being ladies. The ground was very slippery, and the snow-plough that had attempted to clear off the snow had left little hillocks of frozen snow here and there that made the ground very dangerous for Rugby football. There were no accidents, however, of any serious nature, which may be considered very fortunate considering the state of the ground and the desperate struggle made by the two splendid teams. Montreal played a good match and their conduct on the field is not fairly represented by the score, which would make the visitors appear a very much more inferior team to Osgoode than they really are, the score being 45 to 5 in favor of the home players. Montreal, it is true, were successful in scoring only on one play, but they made scoring by Osgoode team desperately hard work throughout the match and they only succeeded in running up the score by that splendid team playing, running and passing, for which they have earned considerable reputation, and this is just where the Montrealers were a little weak. But in the scrimmage the visitors acquitted themselves splendidly, and were fully equal to their opponents in this respect. The teams were as follows: Osgoode Hall, Portion, Montreal, McKay, Bank, Kry, Ktrr, Hull-back, Miller, Wood."

"18921117","M. McOongall acted as Secretary. The other gentlemen present were Lome Drum, Barton, A. Cameron, A. McKay, Murphy, Loe Walker, V. Buchanan. The object of the meeting was to discuss the position of the intermediate championship. It will be remembered that the McGill second fifteen started for Quebec to play their regular match, but were unavoidably detained at Sorel on account of fog and a snowstorm. On arrival at Quebec it was found too dark to play the match and the referee told the McGill men that he had already given the match by default. The McGills promised to go to Quebec the following week, and several telegrams were exchanged, the purport of which was that they were willing to play a friendly game, but the Quebec men studiously avoided all mention of championship. After considerable discussion, in which all sides of the matter were looked into, it was resolved that the date of the match between Quebec and McGill of November 6th be cancelled and that the match be played for the championship on Saturday next, November 14th. The McGills have behaved in a very sportsmanlike manner all through the matter, and it is only fair to them that they should not be deprived of a chance for the championship, for they certainly did all in their power to fulfill their engagement. There was some desultory discussion regarding the letters that have been published regarding Mr. Corbett, who refereed that much discussed football. The general impression appeared to be that Mr. Corbett had been treated very shabbily, but as neither school was a member of the union, the present meeting could take no official notice of it, but the secretary was instructed to write to Mr. Corbett. There was some informal talk about having a clearer understanding of the Rugby rules and some definite interpretation to be sought relative to the obstructive tactics practiced in the West, at the next meeting of the Canadian Association, after which the meeting adjourned. The Crimson Are Not Knowing Their Land. Cambridge, November 15. An air of deep mystery surrounds the Harvard eleven, and there is as much speculation among the students as among graduates and outsiders as to the meaning of Harvard's erratic actions in recent games. One might nearly as well talk to stone walls as to the members or coaches of the team to find out what they think of the probable chances of success against Yale. One thing is quite evident, that Yale's good showing against the University of Pennsylvania has not inspired the Harvard team with any apparent fear of either Yale's offensive or defensive work. A Harvard player said today that the University of Pennsylvania put up a much weaker game against Yale than against the Princeton eleven, and that from the result of last Saturday's game no definite comparison could be drawn between the respective merits of the blue and the orange. As to the game with Harvard it seems very likely that Yale will have to play much harder than she did with Pennsylvania to keep the Crimson from scoring, or even, perhaps, from coming out on top. Everybody admits that from all previous records Yale's chances are brighter than Harvard's, but a few, and the number is growing daily, have been led to believe that Harvard's greatest strength has not been shown this season. It should be remembered that Harvard's last game was a week or so ago. Since then the practice has been so secret and men's mouths so closed that there are rumors in the air that the Harvard team has made encouraging improvement. Cumnock, Cranston, Crosby, '91; Joe Bears, captain in '89; Perry Trafford and Buttes, tackle in '88, have been on hand daily and industriously working to get the men in condition. There can be little doubt that the Harvard team of a week ago are not the same body of men of today. Only when the teams face each other at Springfield next Saturday will their relative strength be known. What the Learns Have Done. All of the three big colleges have now played their last games preparatory to the decisive contests at Springfield and New York. The record made by each team is interesting for comparative purposes. It is as follows: Yale 447 points, opponents 0; Harvard 205 points, opponents 36; Princeton 345 points, opponents 0. The scores made by the three teams last year up to the time of the big games were: Yale 461 points, opponents 0; Harvard 210 points, opponents 18; Princeton 388 points, opponents 0.

"18921123","C. Macfarlane, who has been insisted upon by the Crescents, will again referee the match and the boys may be sure at any rate that they will have fair play at his hands. This seems to go pretty hard with our visitors, as they telegraphed yesterday morning, after 11 o'clock, stating that if no referee was decided upon at 1 o'clock the same day, that the Association would appoint one, in other words they would bring their own referee with them. They did not even take the trouble to find out whether Mr. Macfarlane would act or not. The facts of the matter are in brief as follows: The McGills came down by boat last Saturday fortnight and, being delayed by a snowstorm, reached here too late to play. The referee awarded the match to the Crescents and the latter offered to play McGill a friendly and not a championship match. McGill refused, however, and claimed that having made every reasonable endeavor to get here on time they should be given an opportunity of competing for the championship, and the Association sustained them in this. The question of a date then arose and the McGills wanted to play last Saturday week, as the season closed on that date, but the Crescents refused, saying that it would be too soon after the Thanksgiving Day match. The McGills then offered to come to Quebec last Thursday; but the Crescents declined as the rules of the Association provided that all matches should be played on Saturdays or public holidays. They offered, however, to last Saturday. The Association decided in favor of the Crescents and ordered the match to be played on Saturday. That is the whole story and there is surely nothing in it to warrant charges of unfairness or unsportsmanlike conduct either against the Association or the McGill club. The Crescents owe it as a duty to themselves to repudiate the spiteful and baseless insinuations of the above article. This is what the same paper says today in its report of the match: McGill had honestly lost the match by its delinquency. But McGill ""kicked,"" and the Crescents, unfairly compelled to play by the Rugby Union without a hearing and over the referee's word, showed McGill how to play and win. And the first team men brought down for the occasion by McGill only adds to the glory of the Crescents' victory. And the ""nice little team"" that McGill's friends talked so patronizingly of and said that they could not expect to stand before the McGills. And the bad temper shown by the defeated team, and their inability to take a looking. And didn't the crowd on the field enjoy the match? The Ontario Association.

Harkins Jr., who is also the author of The Midnight Alarm, which made a remarkably successful tour last season, this, his latest play, seems likely to be equally, if not more, successful, judging from the praise accorded to it by the critics of New York City where it was recently produced. As indicated by its title, the play introduces a fire-patrol wagon, and much stress is laid on a scene showing the interior of an ore crushing mill in the gold mining region with the ponderous machinery in actual operation. Add to these a view of Union Square, New York, in a snowstorm, and we have enough of realism to satisfy the most ardent lover of realistic melodrama."

The Parnellites were jubilant when they succeeded in having Mr Fullum, the anti-Parnellite, who was elected to represent South Meath in Parliament, deprived of his seat, and there is a prospect that they will have further cause for joy in the case of Mr Michael Davitt, against whose return from North Meath a petition has been presented. As in the case of Mr Fullum, clerical intimidation in favor of Mr Davitt is charged. It is expected that the judges, after unseating Mr Davitt, will report Bishop Kulty of Meath and several priests of that diocese to Parliament as guilty of intimidation. It has been stated that Mr Davitt desires to resign his seat and to stand again for election without priestly assistance, but under the charge of undue clerical influence he would not be allowed to accept the stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds. Should the election petition judges send to Parliament a protest against Bishop Nully and the priests who are accused, the Irish executive would have no alternative but to prosecute them.

She made the last confession of a dying prisoner, which, in case of death, is legally attested and given to the prisoner's next of kin. Mrs. Maybrick swears she was innocent of moral intent or deed and act against the life of James Maybrick. The Baroness de Rogues was only allowed to see her daughter for a short time. Mrs. Maybrick had several hemorrhages of the lungs, which left her so weak that if they occur again she will surely die. She has been suffering from these hemorrhages for six weeks. She has petitioned Mr. Herbert Asquith, the Home Secretary, to release her from prison before her disease becomes incurable. Home Secretary Asquith states that the condition of Mrs. Maybrick is receiving serious consideration at the Home Office. War Have Paid Dearly London, December 8 The Times' Berlin correspondent says: The Bundesrat, in modifying the duties on alcohol in Count Von Caprivi's bills, intended to meet the army increase, makes a concession to the great landowners, a fact which indicates that the Government has abandoned hope of coming to terms with the advanced Liberals and the Radicals. Even the National Liberals are now pleased, and the Government may find that it has purchased the Conservative support dearly. What Chile Thought of It Valparaiso, December 8 La Union, of Valparaiso, in commenting on President Harrison's message in regard to relations with Chile, says he is much mistaken in thinking that Chile in any way recognizes either Mr. Harrison, his cabinet, or Minister Egan as friends. In paying the Baltimore indemnity and signing the protocol, Chile was actuated by good feeling towards the large majority of people in the United States, whose sympathy with her during the revolution was earnest. The Snowstorm in Europe Vienna, December 8 There is little snow here, but a terrible wind has done much damage in this vicinity and caused many accidents. Budapest is almost lifeless as a result of the snowfall. Nobody goes outdoors unless compelled to do so. Not a single train left yesterday from the eastern and western termini. Northern trains still run, but they are hours late. The telegraph and telephone services are greatly crippled. In Central France London, December 8 Francois, the Anarchist, who blew up Very's restaurant in Paris and killed a number of people, was taken to France for trial last night. Paris, December 8 The Anarchist Francois was arraigned before a magistrate today. He denied his complicity in the Cafe Very outrage. The Kaiser a Naval Designer Berlin, December 8 The Kaiser has designed a warship of which a model has been constructed. In this, several innovations are made in naval architecture. To ensure the health of officers and men, the sleeping apartments are above deck, but in case of battle they can be removed in a few minutes. Things It was Bad Weather London, December 8 The Marquis of Huntley, in a letter to the Times on the agricultural depression, expresses the belief that it is mainly due to bad seasons. Protection, he says, does not benefit the farmers. If so, he asks, how is it that the distress is the same in protected countries? To Invalidate his Election Berlin, December 8 Steps are being taken to invalidate Rector Ahlwardt's election to the Reichstag on the ground of corruption and intimidation of opponents. Several of his supporters maltreated a Radical agent suspected of being a Jew. He was badly injured and was obliged to use a revolver to escape from the mob. No Protection for Them London, December 9 The Utamland Madrid correspondent says that he understands that Premier Sagasta will reverse the protection policy of the Canovas Cabinet as far as possible, by treaties of commerce with the United States and European countries. Surprised Everybody London, December 8 The unanimity and fervid enthusiasm displayed at the agricultural conference, which met in St. James' Hall here yesterday, in favor of protection and bi-metallism, have alike astonished the Conservatives and Liberals. Death of an Artist London, December 8 A dispatch from Boulogne-sur-Mer reports the death of an English artist named Brockman, from the effect of a blow received during a quarrel with a compatriot, De Gacher, who has been arrested. Austria's Army Increase Vienna, December 8 The Army Gazette announces an addition of 3,000 on the peace standard of the army. This indicates that the Emperor is disposed to follow the policy of the German Emperor. Herlonaly III London, December 8 Mr. Herbert Spencer is seriously ill. Vienna, December 8 Von Suppe, the composer, is dangerously ill.

COAL MINE ON FIRE The Drummond Pit Ablaze No More Injury Anticipated New Glasgow, December 8 The town was startled this morning by a report that the Drummond colliery was on fire. It is the property of the Intercolonial Coal Company and has been of late exceptionally well worked and the output largely increased. Inquiry, however, shows that as yet there have been no lives lost and comparatively little injury done. The fire is in a tunnel connecting the main workings with a disused pit, popularly known as the ""Stinkingwillie"" pit and is as yet some considerable distance from the nearest spot where the men are at work. The plan being taken to put out the fire is likely to prove successful. A heavy stone wall is being built across the mouth of the tunnel, shutting it off from the main passage. Air being thus excluded, it is hoped it will soon burn itself out. No serious danger is as yet anticipated and the men are at work as usual, and the horses have not been removed. How the fire originated is a mystery. THE STORM SWEPT WEST Kansas Has an Old Fashioned Blizzard The Texas Cyclone Boston, Kansas, December 8 A typical Kansas blizzard has raged here for 13 hours. Trains are from 12 to 24 hours late; freight trains are snowed up along the lines. The Rock Island, Denver Limited, is lost between here and Fairbury. The snow extends into Oklahoma, and reports of terrible suffering among the settlers are coming in. The loss of stock will be great. Denison, Texas, December 8 The cyclone of Tuesday evening caused no fatalities in this section, but the destruction of property was great. A cattleman named Wiesmar, while riding over a prairie, was killed by a bolt of lightning. Brenham, Texas, December 8 Tuesday's cyclone near this city demolished everything in its path. Several persons were seriously injured. Many families are homeless and utterly destitute. Paragould, Ark, December 8 A heavy wind storm struck this town Tuesday and caused damage to the amount of $50,000. Twenty-six buildings were wrecked. Several persons were seriously injured. SLOWLY GROWING COLDER And There May be a Slight Fall of Snow Toronto, December 8, 11 p.m. The storm central over Lower Michigan yesterday is central tonight over the Upper Ottawa. It is now dispersing. Unsettled weather and local falls of sleet or rain have fallen over Ontario and Quebec. In the Maritime provinces, it is raining.

The detectives were notified, but no trace of the articles could be found. Yesterday, however, a young man named David Stewart was soon on St. Antoine street wearing the coat. Chief Detective Cullen informed Mr. Topple of this fact, and together they came across Stewart and took the coat away from him. They then proceeded to the young man's house and found the cap. Stewart was made a prisoner; he acknowledged taking the articles. The accused will appear before the Police Magistrate this morning. The Car Service Yesterday. The snowstorm yesterday tested the resources of the Street Car company severely. In fact, so far as Point St. Charles was concerned, it demoralized the service altogether. Delays of from half an hour to an hour were frequent, and many disgusted passengers walked, or hired sleighs, rather than waste time standing round waiting for the cars. The two new sweepers were out, and each were loaded up with men. What for it seemed difficult to tell. On the electric sweeper one man did the work and the remaining six or eight sat comfortably in the cab and smoked bad tobacco. On the big horse sweeper it was much the same. It was suggested that perhaps all these useless hands were put on as ballast to keep the sweeper on the track. An Old Scoundrel. An old man of 71 years named Francois Mercier, residing on Jacques Cartier street, was tried and convicted in the Recorder's court yesterday on a very serious charge. There were two accusations of indecent assault on young girls, and the sentence of the court was six months' imprisonment and a fine of $50 or six months more. The girls assaulted were aged 11 and 12 years, respectively, and it was brought out in evidence that one of the children had been in the habit of visiting the place for over a year, and, at the request of Mercier, had induced other girls of her own age to accompany her there. One of the latter told her mother of Mercier's actions, and a warrant was taken out in the Recorder's court on Tuesday, and Mercier was taken into custody; he had no defense to offer. Before Judge Desnoyers yesterday Laurina Renaud was fined $150 and costs or three months for selling liquor without a license. Alfred Amyot was tried on a similar charge, and the case was taken en delibere. Francis O'Connor, for selling liquor on Sunday, was fined $100 or one month, and had his certificate annulled. The case of Amedee Marion, who was accused of allowing an apprentice to sell poison and dispense prescriptions, was dismissed. The case of Harry Phillips, charged with selling without a license, will be heard tomorrow. Joseph Pelletier, for selling on Sunday, was fined $75 and costs or three months, and had his certificate cancelled. A Novel Exhibition.

Coroner McDowell has been notified of the case of Camus Yensky, who died at the South Side Hospital August 23, and whose death had been reported before. It may be that Yensky has been another victim of the alleged plot to poison the non-union men at Homestead. Still another case is reported from North Cambria. Frank Tull, a coal and iron policeman, who was taken sick at Homestead with bowel complaint, and sent to his home in that state, died there with symptoms of poisoning. I HAVE MUCH SNOW, A Big Storm at West Point in New York State. Plattsburgh, Wash, December 21. A snowfall of two feet in this place almost suspended business. It is reported that there was also a heavy fall of snow in many parts of the state. Trains are somewhat delayed and the postal wires are disabled south of Vancouver. Tacoma, Wash, December 21. The heaviest snowstorm in Puget Sound for two years prevailed last night. All streetcar traffic is paralyzed. Kingston, N."
"18921226","Y, December 21 At three o'clock this morning a westbound freight jumped the track near the junction of the Central and West Shore tracks, near Fairport. The tracks were all blocked and in the blinding snowstorm it was difficult to ascertain the extent of the damage. It was nearly noon before the wreck was cleared. George Shepard, trainman on No. 12, was dropped a mile and a half east of Fairport to flag the trains and was struck and killed by passenger train No. 6 about 6:30 o'clock this morning. Much anxiety was expressed by those expecting friends on the westbound train this morning. Rumors of an accident were flying by, but no definite information could be obtained from the officials at the station. Fayetteville, Ark, December 25 A terrible wreck occurred last night at Greenland on the Frisco road. A freight train was passing there when a young man flourished a gun and the engineer supposed he was going to shoot the headlight out as a piece of fun frequently indulged in that settlement, but he allowed the engine to pass and fired into the train. The bullet penetrated an oil tank car and exploded it. This wrecked the train and burned sixteen cars with their contents. The oil spread the fire and it was with difficulty that the citizens prevented the town from burning. About 800 feet of track was destroyed. SCRANTON, Pa, December 21 Three fatal accidents were recorded upon railroads in this vicinity during the noon hour today, the victims being Thomas Dicker, at a crossing over which he was driving in Pittston; Thomas Thig, a brakeman, killed at Mayfield by slipping from a box car and falling upon the track, the cars passing over him; and a boy named Lee Kelly, struck by a Delaware and Hudson train at Green Ridge and killed outright. B, December 25 The oil tank steamer Verhawkn, owned by the Standard Oil Company, arrived at Halifax this afternoon in nearly a helpless state and her crew almost hopelessly exhausted. The Verhawkn sailed fifteen days ago from Avonmouth, in ballast for New York. She met constantly heavy weather and seas continually going over her, and a large quantity of water found its way below. The pumps became choked through ashes and coal getting into the bilges, and as they could not be got out the engine room was flooded and there was a danger of the fires being put out. The entire crew of officers and men were ordered below to try and reduce the water and save the fires and thus save the ship. On the 21st the Verhawkn was boarded by the steamer Elbe, a North German liner, bound east from New York. Captain Robinson asked the Elbe to stand by until morning and the captain of the latter promised to do so, but during the night she disappeared. Early next morning another large steamer bound east, name unknown, saw the Verhawkn's signals of distress and bore down. Capt. Robinson asked her to stand by, as things by this time had become critical, firemen standing to their posts in the water, but shortly after a snowstorm came on and the ships became separated. Both vessels urged Captain Robinson to abandon the Verhawkn, as her engines were disabled owing to the quantity of coal and ashes grinding in the water, but finally the crew got enough water out to let the engines work and the steamer made for Halifax. The crew were completely played out, but the captain says it was through their courage and hard work that the ship was saved. She will repair here and then proceed for New York."
"18921227","AN INTERNATIONAL EPISODE In the President's office at the White House stands a memento of the most famous of derelicts, the British ship Resolute. It is a desk, made of the vessel's timbers, presented to the President of the United States by Queen Victoria. It is a constant reminder of a very graceful international courtesy extended to Great Britain by the United States forty years ago. The Resolute was one of three vessels sent out by the British Government for the relief of Sir John Franklin and his Arctic expedition. In the winter of 1851 the Resolute was nipped in the ice in Melville Bay and was abandoned by her crew. Directly after her abandonment, a heavy snowstorm came up, the ice was broken, and when the storm cleared, two days after, the Resolute had disappeared. It was supposed that she had sunk, and she was reported to the Admiralty as lost and stricken from the Admiralty lists. Four years later, a New England whaling vessel, under command of Capt. James Bullin, George K. Tyson, mate, saw a vessel last in a floe just off Northumberland Gulf. Tyson took a party of men, and, after thirty miles of dangerous travel over the ice pack, came to the ice-locked vessel, and found that it was II"

"18930104","M. Loubet says the Chamber rushed headlong without consideration or preparation into the Panama enquiry. The inquiries seemed suddenly to have lost their senses and they outbid each other in overzealousness and reckless accusation. Doubtless the scandal was bad enough, but the bad judgment of the Chamber had fostered erroneous conceptions among the people of its magnitude. Such an excessive outburst of prudery must have its reaction and thus defeat many of its own ends. The most extravagant hopes had been raised among the disloyal by the recklessness shown in the Chamber, and the whole fabric of Republican institutions in France had been endangered. Unless great care and tact were exercised constantly in the next few weeks the men who had braved so fanatically might have startling proofs of the errors into which they had fallen, and caused others to fall. Every effort must be made to wind up the whole Panama affair before next March in order that engagements in connection with the state debt might be strictly fulfilled. CHILLY WEATHER REPORTED from European Cities. Vienna, January 3. Violent snowstorms have prevailed throughout Austria and Hungary all day. All kinds of traffic have been impeded, and scores of villages have been completely isolated. All the Imperial shooting parties in Styria have been postponed indefinitely. A despatch from Trieste says that all traffic in the city has been stopped by the drifts. In this city the snow is piled ten or twelve feet high between the roads and the sidewalks. No market men have been able to come to town, and there is a great dearth of all farm products. A milk and butter famine has already been proclaimed by the produce dealers. Paris, January 3. Intense cold prevails throughout France. The Seine is icebound. Two old women were found frozen to death this afternoon in an attic in the Latin quarter. They were clothed in rags, had no fire, and apparently had eaten nothing for the last 24 hours. In their bureau drawer were found 80,000 francs in bank notes. LONDON, January 3. The weather in London has been very wintry for several days and much ice has formed in the Thames. Traffic above and below London Bridge is seriously impeded by pack ice. The upper reaches of the river are frozen over, and a further obstruction to navigation is expected. FORT PITT, January 3. An ice gorge three miles long has formed between Belle Vernon and Fayette City, in the fourth Monongahela pool, and another gorge is said to be forming in the fifth pool. The river men will make an attempt to break the gorges, and are anticipating success, as there is plenty of open water above both of them. The river is still rising here, with nearly seven feet of water in the channel. The ice in the vicinity is all broken and floating down with the current."

Sioux City, Iowa, January 7. The Leeds Land and Improvement Company, of this city, failed today with liabilities of $500,000 and assets of less than $1,000,000 in real estate, on which scarcely the amount of liabilities can be raised at this time. The company was organized to build the manufacturing suburb of homes for speculative purposes. The failure has carried down with it the American Security Company, the Leeds Annex Company, and the Sioux City Land Company, which were interested in Leeds with the Leeds and lien company. The total capitalization of the four companies is $3,000,000. Much of this is watered. RAIDED THE CLUB. Vienna, January 7. The police yesterday evening made a raid upon the jockey club on suspicion that illegal games were being played in its rooms. The card rooms were crowded at the time with the elite of the aristocratic and diplomatic circles of Vienna, and large sums of money were at stake. The police seized 400,000 florins in cash and cheques and took the names of those present for future action. The Prince de Montenegra, president of the jockey club, hastened to the offices of the Ministry of Justice to protest against the action of the police and to explain that the course taken was unjustifiable. The Prince was informed that the Emperor himself had especially sanctioned the raid. The Prince de Montenegra thereupon promised that gambling would cease at the club. It is believed the money seized will be returned to the owners. A Report and a Denial. Cincinnati, Ohio, January 7. A paper here says it is well understood that all the great iron pipe companies of the country have combined and will be operated as one company. The baroness firms at Akilystone, Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Anniston, etc., have signed the agreement, and the only one holding out is the one at Columbus. This, it is generally believed, will join next week. The capital stock will hit $20,000,000. Poughkeepsie, January 7. The report from Cincinnati of an iron pipe combine to include Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Buffalo is discredited here by both wrought iron and cast iron pipe men. A Heavy Wisconsin Snowstorm. Ashland, Wis., January 8. The most terrific snowstorm of the season has been raging for the past ten hours, and as yet showing no signs of abatement. All trains are blocked. Charles Slack was picked up on the street in an unconscious condition and badly frozen.

He was escorted to the City Hall where an address was presented to him, after which he replied. The hall was beautifully decorated and standing room was in demand. His Excellency held a reception lasting about half an hour and several of our citizens were introduced to him. He was afterwards invited to the council chamber, where a sumptuous luncheon was prepared for him and attended by a large number of our prominent people. Tomorrow morning he will be driven through the oil regions and then inspect the different refineries and our oil industries. At the refineries, he will be shown the crude oil as it comes from the earth, and the different processes it goes through before being ready for use; also the raw black crude being manufactured into beautiful snow-white wax. Amongst the sights, the committee have arranged to have a well shot with glycerine. On account of the train being delayed by the terrible storm, the attendance was not as large as it would have been.

When the County Court met today, presumably to pass sentence upon the graveyard insurance prisoners, J. Randall and C. Welton, it was found that the prisoners' counsel had on Saturday served Judge Peters with a copy of a writ of error, which stands for argument before the Supreme Court. The next surprise was when Mr. Cuny, for the prisoners, stepped up and served the sitting judge with an order nisi, for a certiorari issued by Judge Palmer, calling on the Crown and judge to show cause why the conviction of the prisoners should not be quashed and all the proceedings stayed in the meantime. As the rule is returnable next Saturday, Judge Peters had no alternative but to adjourn his court for a week. It is understood that the Crown will, in consequence of this action on the part of the prisoners' counsel, proceed as soon as possible with one or more of the indictments yet remaining on the files against Welton and Randall. As all this alleged graveyard insurance took place in Albert County, the ratepayers of St. John are asking themselves why they should be saddled with the cost of all these expensive proceedings. The matter is likely to provoke a discussion at the next session of the Municipal Council. The first real snowstorm of the winter set in this afternoon."
"18930116","I, on January 15, A heavy snowstorm from the northeast is sweeping over England. Snow, sleet and a high wind prevail along the coast. Many small accidents to shipping along the coast are reported. The steamer Brighton, belonging to the Brighton Railway Company and plying between New Haven and Pieppe, left port in a gale this morning. We had a terrible rough passage. A deck house and the smoke stack were washed away, one of her boats was smashed and part of her port rail was torn away by a heavy piece of baggage, while her deck was a wash. When she approached the pier at Pieppe the storm was so blinding that the pilot could not see beyond her bow. The wind was blowing sixty miles an hour and the seas were breaking over her deck so rapidly that none of the eighty passengers was allowed on deck. Without any warning the steamship crashed into the pier. A large hole was stove in her bow and for a minute she stuck fast. Hopes were got aboard and were made fast before she was driven more than twenty feet from the pier. She began filling rapidly. A long gangway was improvised and the passengers were hurried ashore. There was little panic. Half the baggage had been cut off when the captain ordered the men to leave the ship which was settling rapidly. He had hardly followed the last man to the pier when the vessel went under. Off Dartmouth five pilots were drowned while trying to put a man aboard a cutter. The cutter was pitching heavily when the gig approached her. The bowsprit caught the gig and lifted it out of the water. All seven occupants of the gig were thrown out and but two caught the life lines thrown to them and were saved. Vienna, January 15, More snow, accompanied by high winds, has blocked the country roads and interrupted railway traffic. A party of forty traveling in sleighs was caught in a snowdrift two miles from the city and was half buried before help could be summoned. After three hours all were rescued, several with feet or hands frozen."

Gales, McKenna, Wallace, Jud Marker were working further down towards the doors. An ominous cracking of splintering joists was heard and with terrible suddenness the whole upper part of the building came down with a rush upon the men on that floor. Gales was nearest the front door and as the falling plaster began to rattle about his head he made a rush for the street. Just as he reached the pavement the front wall fell upon him burying him out of sight. He was dug out by the firemen and was found to have escaped with serious but not fatal internal injuries. When the building began to cave in, McKenna, Marker, and Wallace ran towards a window in the rear of the store. The first two reached it, but the tons of brick, joists, and paper fell upon them just as they were about to jump out, and crushed the life out of them. Wallace was caught further back and up to a late hour tonight his body had not been recovered. The three men in the office escaped uninjured. The cause of the collapse of the building was probably the weight of paper stored in the upper floors, although Mr. Nixon claims that the stock piled up there was not nearly so great as it has been on many other occasions. The building is a total ruin. The loss is about $30,000. TERRIFIC STORMS AND VERY COLD WEATHER REPORTED THROUGHOUT EUROPE, January 16. A terrific storm has swept this city since 10 o'clock this morning. Sleet or snow has fallen incessantly. The wind has blown a hurricane. Tiles and chimneys have been blown into the street. Half the trees in the streets have been snapped off close to the pavement and four tram-cars have been tumbled from the tracks. It has been impossible for vessels to enter the harbor. An Italian barque which tried to come in at noon was battered by the ice to a wreck in sight of the docks and foundered with all on board. Two attempts were made to send help to the crew but the sailors put back before they had gone a dozen yards from land as it was impossible they said for small crafts to live in such a sea. An English barque went ashore an hour later just outside of the harbor and four of the crew were drowned. A Greek steamship has been endeavoring to get inside for the last two hours, flying signals of distress and firing guns, but no assistance has been sent her. Two small vessels are reported to have been wrecked off Point St. Andrea. A large wave broke over part of the waterfront in the early evening and flooded the streets nearby. Two cabs with horses and drivers were caught in the current where the water was receding and were carried into the harbor and drowned. Fifty persons have been injured by falling trees, tiles, and chimneys. LONDON, January 10. The weather throughout Europe is intensely cold. In Russia the mercury is reported to have fallen to 68 degrees below zero and in Siberia to 75 degrees below zero. Wood fires are kept burning in the streets of St. Petersburg for the benefit of wayfarers. An army of men is employed in the streets of Berlin clearing away the snow. So far they have been able to clear passages only in the principal streets. All suburban traffic is suspended. While a boatman of Gilbert was trying to release his ice-bound boat, a sudden change of wind drove the boat with its owner out to sea. Twelve pilots tried to rescue the man, but were unable to help him on account of ice. They then tried the rocket apparatus, but this also failed. The man, doubtless, perished of exposure in a fearful snowstorm that was raging. All river and canal traffic in Germany is interrupted. Navigation on the Baltic has almost ceased. The pontoon bridges on the Rhine have been washed in. In some parts of Hungary the thermometer is 52 degrees below zero Centigrade.

Orders from Ottawa were received at the Citadel this morning countermanding the previous order relative to the removal of the guns from the fortifications, but for the recent heavy snowstorms the guns would have been removed before this. A local paper says that an English firm has just contracted with one of our large shipping houses here for the export of 6,000 standards (St. Petersburg measure) during the next summer from Montreal and Charlemagne. The flattery had a march out this morning on snowslopes. February 7. News came to this city this afternoon that the brigantine Edith, owned by John Taylor & Co., of and for this port, was ashore at Fox Point, about ten miles east of Halifax. The vessel was bound from Demerara with a cargo of molasses and sugar in bags. It appears the Edith was trying to make port during the heavy northeast gale and snowstorm of last night and struck some time after midnight. She was seen after daylight this morning by an inhabitant in the locality, and attempts were made to reach her, but such efforts were in vain on account of the tremendously heavy sea running. The waves were making clean breast over the vessel and it was next to impossible to get a message ashore and this was only finally accomplished by the captain attaching a note to a life buoy, which was then thrown overboard and eventually dashed ashore. Carriers brought the message to the city appealing for assistance and a steamer was immediately despatched. The latest information says the Edith lies broadside on the rocks with a bad list towards the shore and when the messenger left was showing signs of breaking up. Watch will be kept all night on shore, so that immediate assistance can be rendered to those on board should the vessel go to pieces. It is utterly impossible to attempt any rescue of the crew now owing to the sea and surf. No boat could live in it. It seems a terrible thing, but nevertheless true, that seven men composing the crew may be lost before assistance can go to their rescue. The Edith is 172 tons register, and is commanded by Captain Walker Lowe. She sailed from Demerara January 10th with 192 puncheons of molasses and 556 bags of sugar. The cargo is insured in Kenny's and Twining and Son's agencies for $12,100, and the vessel is insured in the Nova Scotia Marine for $4,000."
"18930210","H, February 10, The County Insane Asylum, four miles from here, was burned to-night and 44 lives were lost. When Watchman William Chcevey made his 10 o'clock trip into the insane asylum, he found the fire coming out of a cell occupied by a woman and gave the alarm. William Driscoll, the keeper, with his family, lived in the building, and he at once broke the locks of the fifty-four cells and tried to get the inmates out. Then he got his wife and two children out, neither of whom was dressed. Of the 44 inmates, only four escaped. They were Wm. Twomblay, Rose Sanderson, William Daly, and Frank Doiisbon. The latter walked two miles in a blinding snowstorm with only his shirt on to William Home's house, where he was taken care of."

"18930314","Y, March 13, The ico gorge in Hondout creek, below Eddyville, gave way late this afternoon and let a tremendous amount of water down the creek. The steamboats of the Cornell Steamboat company and about fifty canal boats were swept into the river and driven helpless downstream. Many of them were badly damaged. The steamers Pittston and Adriatic, valued at $18,000, were so badly stove in that it is feared they will sink. A number of the canal boats were crushed like eggshells and sank in the creek. Never before has such wholesale damage been done in this stream. There were 18,000 barrels of cement stored in the Lawrence Cement company's mill valued at over $10,000. These are a total loss; it is thought that the loss to the Cornell fleet will be about $40,000. There is no insurance. The loss to the Delaware and Hudson exceeded $5,000. The river continued to rise until 7 o'clock in the morning, when a point twenty-two and a half feet above the low watermark was reached, the water being thirteen feet higher than at noon on Saturday. Since then the water has been receding and no more trouble is anticipated. At Waterford a number of buildings on the bank of the Mohawk were demolished. Everything movable was taken away by the flood. The state dam at Cohoes, which has been condemned this winter by the state engineer, was badly injured. Unless the water recedes before night it is feared the dam will go out. The Champlain canal crosses the river at this point, and should the dam go out navigation on the canal will be closed the greater part of the summer. Floods Out West, Chicago, March 13, Reports from the flooded districts in the Northwest indicate that the weather is generally turning colder, which will have the effect of checking the rise in the streams. Throughout the Northwest snowstorms are raging and in the upper peninsula of Michigan the thermometer has dropped to 0 degrees. Snow is falling at many points in Wisconsin. In Eastern Michigan, however, the thaw continues. At Grand Rapids the river is higher than for thirty years and most of the factories have been obliged to shut down. Reports are received of great damage in the adjacent agricultural districts. Along the upper Mississippi, too, the ice is running out and much loss has been occasioned at Sioux City, Iowa, Hannibal, Missouri, and other points where boats have been swept from their moorings, bridges carried away and other damage done. In Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, March 13, The floods in the eastern section of Pennsylvania are abating and no further damage of a serious nature is anticipated. In the mining regions a number of mines have been flooded, throwing probably 4,000 men and boys out of work. It is expected that mining will be resumed in a few days. At Reading today two houses in the course of erection collapsed in consequence of their walls becoming water-soaked. Four workmen were severely injured. At Williamsport a water main supplying the western portion of the city was broken and the contents of the reservoir were emptied into the river. A Canadian Flood, Wam-acubuimi, Ont, March 13, The mild weather and rain of the last few days has melted the snow and ice very rapidly in this section, causing a tremendous flood in the Sydenham. The water has risen above high water mark. The ice in the east branch broke up this afternoon and gorged above the town, causing the water to rise so high it is flowing over the banks and flooding the farm lands in all directions. Many houses in low places are flooded and the occupants are moving out. This evening the ice below the iron bridge in town started sweeping down, broke the fastenings on the steam barge Ireland and a large tow barge carrying them down against the Erie and Huron railway bridge, damaging one of the abutments so the evening train going south cannot cross."
"18930321","W, March 20 A destructive hurricane swept on the 10th of March over the New Hebrides islands and New Caledonia, clearing ravaging villages and causing great loss of life. Large numbers of the natives are said to have perished and extensive districts were devastated. New Caledonia forms with neighboring islands the most important penal colony of France, and particulars are anxiously awaited as to the destruction of life and property at Noumea and other points. The New Hebrides have but few white inhabitants, but among those are missionaries from America and Europe. The hurricane raged incessantly for three days and the rainfall was enormous. Half of New Caledonia is flooded. In Tohio alone ten persons were drowned. The estimated property loss was at least $120,000. St. John's Mid, March 20 A fearful blizzard visited this section yesterday. It was the worst experienced in twelve years. The streets were snowed under to the extent of three feet. In the country the snow is ten feet deep in places. All railway lines are blocked. At Salmon five men were drowned by the swamping of a herring skiff. It is feared that other disasters have occurred. THE ANN ARBOR STRIKE Interviews With Grand Masters Nar, Kraut and Arthur, Think Tank, Ind, March 20 Grand Master Sargeant, of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, in an interview yesterday, said: ""The action on the part of Judge Picks, of Toledo, looking to the arrest for contempt of court of all engineers who have led their engines on the Lake Shore road rather than handle Ann Arbor freight is news to me. I left Toledo Friday morning as soon as I saw there was no possible chance for a settlement and came home. Saturday I got a telegram from Chief Arthur saying he and I had been jointly sued in Judge Tuft's court for $250,000 damages by the Ann Arbor road for ordering the strike on their road. However, there is no provision in the Brotherhood's rules that requires firemen on other roads to refuse to handle freight from a road on which there is a strike; so the present action of Judge Picks can hardly apply to us. The engineers have such a rule, however, and this rule will now be put to the test as to whether or not it is legal. I realize that both the actions in Judge Taft's and Judge Picks' courts are very important ones, and on their verdict depends much of interest to the future of railroad organizations. Yesterday I received a telegram that three Brotherhood firemen had been discharged from the Lake Shore for refusing to handle Ann Arbor freight. I shall expect the engineers to see that these men get back their places, as they got into trouble through the engineers living up to their boycott rule, which drew the firemen into it. Chief Arthur is merely enforcing the laws of his order as he finds them, which he is obliged to do. Whether one can be sued for damages for ordering a strike on a railroad as the head of the firemen's organization is one of the questions involved, and as soon as I am summoned I shall appear to answer. The question is one of the gravest that ever confronted our organization. Cleveland, Ohio, March 20 Chief Engineer Arthur, of the Brotherhood of Engineers, was here yesterday, but refused to discuss the Ann Arbor strike further than to say: ""We are law-abiding citizens and are going to obey the order of the court."" Mr. Arthur would give no hint as to the future course of the Brotherhood.

DIED IN THE SNOW Nearly Three Hundred Prisoners Perish on the Journey to Siberia, London, March 20 Advices from St. Petersburg give the details of a sad loss of life among a band of convicts bound for the prisons of Siberia. The band numbered in all three hundred and seventy-four persons, including a large number of persons sentenced to exile for political crimes. In accordance with custom the convicts were marching to their various destinations. They had spent the night in Tomsk, Western Siberia, and continued their journey early in the morning. A snowstorm was prevailing, and when six hours' march from Tomsk the storm had become so severe that all the roads were obliterated. Chained together the convicts struggled on until gradually the weaker ones fell in the deep snow, dragging the stronger ones down with them. Despite the efforts of the Cossack guards the exhausted people could make no attempt to save themselves, and they were abandoned to freeze to death while the others were driven forward, those in charge of them hoping to get them into shelter. The storm continued to increase in violence and the traveling became worse and worse. Now and then prisoners would drop by the wayside, where they would soon be covered by the rapidly falling and drifting snow. When the guards managed to get what few remained of their charges to a place of safety they found that of the 374 persons they had started with only 61 survived. Sixty-two of those who had perished were political prisoners. Among those lost were Madame Lazarov, six other women and four children.

THE KNOCKED OUT WITH A 72 OUNCE PILLOW. A Topeka correspondent writes to the Journal as follows: ""I had the pleasure of witnessing a very exciting as well as novel contest recently near Lydon, this state. It was styled a pillow fight, and was fought in a sixteen-foot ring, and was like any prize fight, only instead of gloves the contestants used a pillow weighing seventy-two ounces, and the way they were wielded was a caution, and the punishment was severe. The contestants were Ed Carey, a local athlete, and Billy Waring, a member of a theatrical company playing in that vicinity. They fought for a wager of $100 a side, and was won by Waring in the first half of the fifth round, who with a clever swing of his pillow, landed on Carey's neck and head so hard as to render him unconscious for almost ten minutes. BILL KENDRICK, the old-time professional sprinter, died in San Francisco a few days ago. He was born in Massachusetts sixty years ago, and was the original ""ringer."" He has been on the cinder path for forty years, and has run more races than any other man. An idea of how much it costs to run a winter race track can be gained from the fact that for track expense alone the Hudson County Jockey Club has paid out over $15,000 this winter. Nearly half this amount has been paid for shoveling and sweeping snow. The rest of the money has been spent for rolling, harrowing and other track work. A snowstorm costs the management of Guttenberg from $500 to $1,000. A SMALL BLAZE. A nasty little blaze broke out at 3 o'clock this morning in the cigar store of"

It having been reported in the city that owing to the severe snowstorm which prevailed on Friday night along Lake Superior there was a blockade of trains, a prominent Canadian Pacific Railway official stated that, although the storm was the most severe one known for several years, and that snow fell to the depth of two feet, the line was cleared by snowploughs on Saturday, and it did not interfere in any way with the passenger trains and only delayed the freight trains twelve hours. Owing to the severity of the storm the roofing of the freight shed at Moose Bay was blown away, several trees were blown down, and also did very serious damage to the timber depots.

Judgment in the Ross will case will be delivered Thursday. Some time ago the City council authorized the sending of a deputation to England to float the new million dollars of debentures to meet the obligations falling due on July 1st, the deputation to be composed of Mayor Fremont, Ald. Hearn and City Treasurer Lafrance. It was decided tonight that they should leave Quebec next Monday and sail from New York the following Wednesday. The council has now received notification that a petition will be presented to a judge in chambers on the 16th inst. in the name of Tims McLaughlin asking him to declare the recent bylaw respecting the raising of revenue illegal. The basis of the city's revenue is the business and other taxes and the deficiency is made up by a tax on real estate, which tax is imposed yearly by a special by-law. The council is obliged by law to lay aside, after providing for all requirements, 5 per cent to meet contingencies and 10 per cent to meet failures in the collection of revenue. This year the demands were so great that there was nothing left for the reserve without raising the tax on real estate. This would not be popular, so the reserve was dispensed with and a by-law passed. The petitioner claims that this is illegal and wants the court to order the council to impose an extra tax on real estate for the present fiscal year to make up the $80,000 required. This, it is feared, will embarrass the deputation in its mission. Hon. Messrs. Taillon, Kantel and Beaubien arrived in town tonight and a Cabinet meeting will be held tomorrow at 4 p.m. There is no very important business. Hon."

"18930508","T. Fisher Unwin with some wholesome truths addressed to persons intending to emigrate. In spite of a few blunders, it is an honest, instructive and patriotic work, the circulation of which in the United Kingdom must be serviceable to both the mother country and to Canada. The arrangements of the British authorities for the slaughter and examination of Canadian live stock, pending the decision as to whether the scheduling order will stand or not, are very complete. The cattle are to be landed at specified wharves and are to be specially marked. They are to be killed in special slaughterhouses, and no other carcasses or parts of carcasses are to be allowed in contact with them till the examination is concluded. If effectually carried out, these rules should prevent any such mistake as that by which an Irish beast getting into a herd of Canadians, as is alleged, brought about the scheduling order of last fall. If Canada is as free from pleuro-pneumonia and like contagious diseases as there is reason to believe she is, and if the veterinary inspectors do their duty right, it will be reasonable to look for an early restoration of the old privileges in British markets. The bright sunshine of yesterday gave a touch of summer to the season that was most welcome. Though the rains and drizzles of last week were unpleasant to the city, in many parts of the country they were what was badly wanted. Their effect is visible in the green carpet that has taken the place on the earth's surface of the gray-brown hue that up to a week ago covered field and wood. A few days of warm sunshine will complete the revolution and give vegetation a great start. Meanwhile, any who are over inclined to grumble may compare their lot with that of Austria and Hungary, where on Saturday, trains were blocked and traffic stopped by a heavy and widespread snowstorm. The German Reichstag has rejected the Army bill by a vote of 210 to 102, and has been dissolved. In former cases when the Kaiser and Parliament in Germany have had to appeal to the people to decide between them, the popular voice has gone with the Kaiser. There are signs that, this time, it may go with the Reichstag. It will likely be well for Germany, in some ways at least, if it does. There must come a time when the question will be settled where supreme power lies in the Fatherland, just as it has come in other countries, and the settlement will have to be in the people's favor. France, imitating the United States in regard to the Chinese, has adopted the principle of a measure which requires all foreigners resident in its territory to specially register their names so that the authorities may know who and what they are. England, which says little or nothing in its constitution about either liberty, fraternity or equality, has a good deal more of it in her practice than either of these two republics. All who respect her laws may live in her territories as if they had a right there. Mr. McCarthy, in his Kingston speech, thanked Mr. Meredith for having acknowledged his right to think and speak for himself. So far it does not appear that any opponent of the new departure has had occasion to return the compliment. A perusal of McCarthy organs fails to find many references to Conservatives except as monopolists, columbia esters, slaves of manufacturers, hidebound partisans and political ignoramuses. The big steamships Campania and Paris are racing their way across the Atlantic in an endeavor to beat the record from New York to England. An international interest is given to the contest by the fact that the Paris carries the United States flag. As the Paris is British-built and practically British-manned, there is more of appearance than reality in this phase of the case, however. The Globe's private vote on the liquor question is not waking up popular excitement. It might create more interest and give variety to its conundrums by adding to the list one which would allow a man to declare whether he was a prohibitionist or a favorer of Sir Oliver Mowat's plebiscite. Burke and Wilson, who killed Detective Phair, at London, have been sentenced to twelve years in penitentiary. Mr. Phair was done to death by these men whilst he was in the discharge of his duty.

"18931102","The document is, of course, of the greatest importance from a scientific point of view, and only those who know something of geology will be able to estimate it at its true value; but the general reader will also find in it pages which invite and retain his attention. The members of the Geological Corps are not drawing-room scientists who go out on the field armed with a micrometer and a geological hammer and return to the railway track in time to dine in the cars on the way home. They go into the wilds accompanied only by Indian guides and baggage carriers. Take, for instance, the work done last year in the exploration of the Rocky Mountains to the northwest of Calgary. The party left Worley in June with six pack horses carrying instruments, baggage, and supplies for five weeks, reached the Saskatchewan at the Kootanie Plain, and spent a few days at Glacier Lake, one of the sources of the Saskatchewan, of which a short but interesting description is given. Glacier Lake occupies the bottom of a deep valley bounded by high precipitous limestone mountains, and is about three miles long by a mile wide. A few miles above the head of the lake the valley is filled by the Great Saskatchewan Glacier, and two miles further on is terminated by a line of cliffs out of which the ice from the great river of the central range of the Rockies precipitates itself in ice cascades and avalanches. The terse phrases of the geologist call to the imagination a scene whose magnificence could only be adequately described by a writer with the eye of a painter and the pen of a poet. The surveying party had then to cut its way along the Howsepasa, which has not been used for some years, and was almost blocked by fallen timber. The old Moberly trail, which was next taken, was even worse; with all hands chopping, the party could only clear a few hundred yards a day. It had been intended to descend the Columbia to Canoe River and then cross the mountains by the Athabasca Pass, but this part of the programme had to be abandoned. An early snowstorm compelled a return to civilization in September, but not before good work had been done. It is thought probable that gold will be found in paying quantities in this part of the range, and a lode of galena was discovered west of Kinbasket Lake, which has since been reported to yield 26.25 ounces of silver to the ton. Another adventurous expedition was that into the country lying north of the Churchill River, and south of Athabasca Lake and Bear River. The region explored (an area of about 40,000 square miles) is remote from all ordinary routes, no reports or descriptions of it have been published, and the greater portion of it has never been traversed by white men, not even by officers of the Hudson's Bay Company. Starting from Prince Albert on June 17th, the expedition crossed the Saskatchewan, and entered the district watered by the Shell River, an almost level or very gently rolling country, with rich dark soil, wooded with groves of poplar varied with prairie glades. At a distance of about thirty miles from Prince Albert the Shell River winds in a narrow channel through the bottom land of a wide, sloping valley like that of the Saskatchewan. Beautiful gravel plains and terraces extend along the sides of this valley, and these are followed by the trail for the next forty or fifty miles, making one of the most beautiful roads in the Northwest Territories. On arriving at the south end of Green Lake, the party took to canoes and descended the Churchill River to the mouth of the Cariboo. The latter stream was swollen so that it was impossible to track the canoes with a line, and the depth of the water and the bottom of soft quicksand prevented the use of poles, so that they had to fight their way against the rapid current with the paddle. The source of the river is in a series of small lakes lying in a sandy plain, which was crossed by several portages, and the party arrived at Cree Lake, which is about fifty miles long. Leaving this at the north end by the Cree River, Wapota Lake was entered on the evening of the third day, and by way of the Black River the party arrived on July 27th at Fond du Lac, on the north shore of Lake Athabasca. From this point a return trip was made to the Black River for a more careful examination of the country. The narrative of this expedition is interesting and part of it may be given in the words of the officer in command, Mr."

Dr. Norman, has felt obliged to resign his position as a member of the board of management of the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, and the Bishop of Quebec has appointed Archdeacon Roe in his place. A letter has been received from the Bishop of Mackenzie River, Bishop Reeve. It is dated Fort Simpson, August 4th, and took nearly three months to reach Toronto.

A Negro Killed His Wife to Death for Beating Him, Kingston, Ont, November 6. A most brutal murder was committed here this forenoon. J. R. Kicheson, colored, knocked down and kicked his wife to death. Kicheson has always been cruel to his wife, and it is said that he often threatened to do the terrible deed. She had left him several times, but was as often induced to return. Yesterday Kicheson began abusing his wife again, and this morning after he had left for work she engaged a dray to carry off her household effects, intending to leave for good. It is supposed that he suspected what she would do, for he returned. She tried to escape but he ran her down. The coroner's inquest was held this afternoon and a verdict of willful murder was brought in. Broken Out Again, Jena, November 6. The artesian well at Richtenheim, Prussia, which required the efforts of several engineers to check its flow, which threatened to inundate the town, has broken out again and is throwing forth enormous quantities of water.

An Edict Against Gambling, Berlin, November 6. Emperor William issued today the expected edict against gambling in the army, by it he forbids any game of hazard of any kind among men in active service, and directs the chief officers to report and punish severely all transgressors of the order. The edict is worded so strongly that everybody now believes that all the officers implicated in the Hanover gambling scandal will be dismissed from the army. The United States School Children, Washington, D.C., November 6. The annual report of W. X. Perreault, also a good Liberal, in a letter on the federal surplus, puts in a plea for the maintenance of such a tariff as will prevent the workingmen of Canada from being brought down to the level of the starving and famished laborers of the old countries. He further characterizes as a patriotic policy the maintenance of a tariff that will protect home labor against foreign competition. Mr. Perreault is even more radically opposed to the convention's tariff idea than the Herald is to the suffrage plank. Mr. Perreault is also a gentleman who has traveled and knows whereof he speaks. The English coal famine still continues and is causing severer suffering as the weather becomes colder. The recent conference of masters and men proved fruitless, but there is a gleam of hope that a settlement may be arrived at. The coal owners have moderated their demands, and the miners seem inclined to be reasonable. Their leaders have apparently abandoned their unbending attitude and are about to submit to the men a proposal for arbitration. The position the miners originally took was that their wages were as low as they ought to be, and they would not submit to a reduction whatever the state of trade might be. Their acceptance would be a sign of weakness, for it is generally acknowledged that it would be likely to result in what the miners have all along strenuously resisted - a reduction in wages. There are various ways of punishing contempt of court. There is the New Brunswick way, which Mr. Ellis' case has made somewhat famous. Then there is the Southern way, which, as illustrated recently at Atlanta, the Georgian papers are talking about, wherein the judge descended from the bench, thrashed the offender, who happened to be a lawyer, and ejected him from the court. In any case, however, contempt appears to be a serious crime. Winnipeg bankers report that the heavy November payments on account of merchants' bills falling due were met in a manner which exceeded their most sanguine expectations and indicating a completely satisfactory state of business affairs in the province. This may be one reason why the Liberals are talking of letting the Winnipeg election go by default. When everyone has plenty of money to pay his debts is a poor time to run a blue ruin candidate.

The contract supply of spring wheat at Chicago is 12,301,000 bushels, more than double the supply of No. 2 red. Last year the contract supply was only 2,202,000 of spring, just a trifle in excess of the stock of No. 2 red. The receipts of new corn at Baltimore so far this season have been only 47,000 bushels against 287,000 last year. The exports of wheat from Russia from August to October 28 have been 21,370,000 bushels, the exports in the last of October increasing very rapidly. The total since January 1, however, has been only 61,580,000 bushels, against 82,000,000 bushels last year. The latest crop reports from Australasia speak of the outlook for the growing wheat as quite favorable. The advices from the Argentine Republic state that the growing wheat crop is maturing under quite favorable conditions. Some damage has been done to corn by the locusts. The reports regarding the demand for oats on the other side show quite a good trade. In France the markets are reported very firm. Black Irish oats are 10s, mid black Swedish 21s for 330 pounds. At London American and Canadian oats, it is stated, are held too high for the markets either English or continental. Russia has shipped freely of oats, being willing to sell at the ruling prices, and during the latter part of October there was a very heavy gain in the shipments; in fact, large shipments began to be seen as early as the third week in September. The total shipments from Russia from August 1 to October 21 have been 17,200,000 bushels, against 12,200,000 bushels two years ago. The total, however, since January 1 has only been 34,514,000 bushels, against 50,000,000 bushels two years ago. The English crop of hops is estimated at practically the same figure as last year. Estimates of the world's crop vary from 128,000,000 lbs to 140,000,000 lbs, against 153,000,000 lbs last year. The total cultivated area in the United Kingdom is 10,030,140 acres. The London Corn Trade Journal says that the fact that Russia is underselling America at 60 to 78 cents for bushel is a great disappointment to American holders, but Russian exports will probably cease after the current month, giving better opportunity for better American trade. The last reports make the duty on flour in the principal European countries as follows: United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands and Denmark, free; Italy $1.40 per bbl of 100 lbs; Spain $2.20; Sweden 60 cents; Switzerland 43 cents, excepting with special treaty countries, and then 34 cents; Germany $2.22, excepting with special treaty countries, and then $1.04; Portugal prohibited, excepting under certain conditions and restrictions. When importations are permitted the rate is $2.02. In France the rate varies from $1.37 to $2.00 according to the rate of extraction, and on flour from extra European countries imported via European countries an additional duty of 2 cents is charged. The visible supply of wheat east of the Rockies is 61,407 bushels, an increase over the previous week of 3,520,000 bushels. On the Pacific coast the supply is 10,220,000 bushels, an increase of 354,000 bushels, making the net increase, both coasts, 3,883,000 bushels. The stock in Australia, Europe and afloat for Europe is 80,700,000 bushels, a decrease of 372,000 bushels; world's stock, 101,400,000 bushels, an increase of 3,511,000 bushels. The stock of corn in this country is 9,000,000 bushels, a decrease of 500,000 bushels. Oats increased 14,010 bushels, the stock now being 6,770,000 bushels. The Winnipeg Commercial says: In Manitoba the movement eastward has continued large, but country markets have not been taking in much from farmers. The week, however, was a broken one, with a heavy snowstorm on Thursday, and as fall ploughing has now ceased, buyers look for larger marketings at country points, if farmers will accept present unprecedentedly low prices. The price to farmers in Manitoba country markets this week at most points has been 40c per bushel for No. 1 hard, which is certainly a low figure for such a choice quality of wheat. At some points under 40c was paid; at Virdon, for instance, the quotation being 38c for No. 1 hard. A few points were above 40c, Morden quoting 43c, and other points 41c; but 40c was the rule, with No. 2 hard 2c under No. 1, these being prices to farmers in country markets. In Winnipeg the mills were taking in wheat from farmers at 40c for No. 1 hard. Business in round lots was quieter. Country dealers have considerable wheat which has cost them too high to sell at a profit on the present basis of values, and they are inclined to hold. No. 1 hard afloat, Fort William, spot delivery, was quoted at 57c to 60c per bushel. No. 2 hard sold at 57c, spot delivery, afloat, Fort William, on Friday. On Thursday there was a sale of No. 1 white Fife, spot, afloat, at 50c per bushel. A Canadian Pacific railway official reports that the company had taken out 1,500,000 bushels up to the beginning of this week, and they will move 1,500,000 bushels more by the end of November, or about 8,000,000 bushels in all. This includes all the wheat shipped out except what goes to Duluth via the Northern Pacific. Stocks in store at our Lake Superior ports on November 11 were 1,508,304 bushels, being an increase of 258,000 bushels for the week. Receipts were 733,057 and shipments 607,021 for the week. A year ago stocks were 1,512,247 bushels, being an increase of 230,200 for that week. Peerbohm's cable today says: Cargoes off coast, wheat steadily held; maize nil.

Wheat opened steady at yesterday's closing prices, and gradually strengthened, closing better. Corn opened weak, and showed no rally to the close. Provisions kept fairly steady. Pork improving 25c November, Lard and ribs closed a shade easier. The closing quotations were: Wheat 61c to 65c December; 63c to 61c May; Corn, 35c November and December; 35.5 to 36c January; 30c to 39.5c May; Pork, $12.75 November, $12.55 January, $12.07 May; Lard, $7.82 January, $7.07 bid May; Ribs, $10.05 January, $10.10 May. Wheat dull and steady at yesterday's closing prices, December relatively firmer than May, Singer ostensibly pounding market, but seems to have brokers buying May at 67.5c. Pardridge buys a little when he does anything. Trade very small and mostly by local scalpers. 11:30 a.m. The course of the wheat market yesterday hinged on the Peerbohm quotations for Russian wheat for April and May delivery, and the setback resulted from the indiscriminate realizing by local speculators, as closing cables were higher, and quoted California May wheat 11c higher than the Peerbohm figures for Russian. The feeling obtained later that the bears had outlived the crowd and had covered a lot of shorts cheaper than they expected to do. 11:50 a.m. Wheat steady, the crowd buying against puts. 12:17 p.m. Provisions are firm but dull; offerings not heavy. 12:22 p.m. Poyden & Co sold about 200,000 corn at 39.5c May. There were good buyers at 39c and 39.5c early. Miller, Powell & Co's New York letter says: Wheat for two or three hours there was a very dull market, with the local talent playing for a break. They sold it down 1c, but it was evident that no long stuff of consequence was brought out, and when an effort was made near the close to cover, a spirited rally was the result. It is said Toole and Sherman have been heavy buyers for some days, and this line has materially increased today. The primary receipts for the week are about 1,100,000 less than for the previous week, showing that we are gradually getting down to the bottom of farmers' fins. The feeling is quite strong at the close with indications of higher prices tomorrow. Corn and oats were easier early and the estimate for 105 cars of corn tomorrow had a depressing effect, but these gains braced up with wheat towards the close. The trade is a little afraid of the receipts of corn with navigation about to close, but the consumptive demand will probably take care of those without materially increasing stocks. Provisions are dull, but firm with a tendency towards higher prices. At Chicago wheat closed at 61.5c to 61.8c December, on 63.5c to 63.8c May. Corn, 35.5c November and December, 36.5c January, 30.5c to 31.5c May, 40c July. Oats, 27.5c November, 27.8c December, 40c May. Meredith & O'Brien, brokers, St. Sacramento street, quote the opening, highest, lowest and closing prices in Chicago today as follows: Wheat 61.5c to 61.8c December; 63.5c to 63.8c May; Corn 35.5c to 36c November; 36.5c January; 30.5c to 31.5c May; Oats 27.5c to 27.8c November; 27.8c December; 40c May."

FROM THE YOUNG GILT, Toronto, December 3 Mr. Warring Kennedy, the well-known wholesale dry goods man, has been prevailed upon to run for the mayoralty next month. Mr. Kennedy, who is one of the most respected business men in the city, is a Conservative, and his prospects of being Toronto's Mayor for 1894 by a big majority are remarkably bright. Toronto's citizens are most displeased at the failure of the Street railway to heat the cars as provided in the agreement with the city. The City Engineer has given an order to the company to heat the cars with tires or other means forthwith. Many of the newest cars are fitted with electric heaters, but the company says it has not sufficient power to heat these cars with electricity and it has no arrangement for heating them in any other way. Toronto had its first snowstorm of the season today. Fully four inches fell on the level and sleighs were in use during the day. Money is easier. Toronto banks are asking 5 to 6 percent for funds on call, but borrowers are holding all, knowing the tendency of the market is in their favor and that they will soon get money lower. Local banks have made loans this week at 5 percent for three months.

The Navy Department has received a cablegram from Rio de Janeiro that indicates preparations by President Peixoto for a big battle between his forces and those of Admiral Mello. The dispatch is from Captain Picking, commanding the United States naval force at Rio, and in substance is as follows: ""The Brazilian Government has requested foreign vessels to move from their present anchorage and has drawn a line within which it will be dangerous to venture. This will prevent the loading and unloading of cargoes."" A WARNING, THEN COLDER; And in the Meantime, Say the Probs, It Will Snow. Meteorological Office, Toronto, Ont, December 11, 11 p.m. The storm over the Northwest yesterday has moved with great rapidity and is now central over Indiana. It is causing a general snowfall and high winds over the lake district.

Want a Trade Modus Vivendi, Bilbao, December 11. A meeting of commercial men was held in this city on Saturday last to protest against the commercial treaties negotiated with Germany and other countries. The meeting denounced the Government for negotiating the treaty with Germany and adopted resolutions declaring that a modus vivendi should be negotiated with France, England, Germany, Italy, and Austria. No. 1, of the Flint and Marquette line, went ashore at Whitefish Bay, six miles north of Milwaukee. The boat is exposed to a terrible easterly gale and a heavy sea is running. A blinding snowstorm prevails. There are eighteen passengers and a crew of about fifteen on the steamer. The seas were running so high that the life-saving apparatus is being taken overland to Whitefish Bay. The life-saving crew found difficulty in launching their surf boat as there is a pile of ice eight or ten feet high all along the shore, but succeeded, however, after a time in getting it launched into the breakers and rowed out to the steamer. The waves were so high it was concluded not to take off the passengers as the boat appeared to be safe. The seas are breaking over her some, but the wind is now down to 20 miles an hour and the sea is decreasing a little. There are two women among the passengers. The life-saving crew found everybody on board badly frightened, but no one was hurt. Supplies of food have been sent to the steamer and will be taken out from shore by the life-saving crew. The two women have been brought ashore from the wreck. They are Mrs. Sorren Peterson and Miss Flora Grindman, of Ludington, Mich."
"18940104","STORM IX ENGLAND, Wrecks Are Reported as Occurring on the Southern Coast, London, January 3, A blinding snowstorm accompanied by a heavy wind and furious sea prevailed in the English Channel last night. The packet service between English and French ports was interrupted, and some of the steamers suffered damage. The packet from Ostend was unable to land at Dover owing to the tremendous sea and cut out into the channel again to await high water, when it was thought that the storm would abate somewhat. Marine disasters are feared. A despatch from Broadstairs on the east coast of the Isle of Thanet, county of Kent, says that three vessels off that coast displayed signals of distress last evening, and that the Broadstairs lifeboat put out to render assistance. No headway could be made against the gale, and the boat was compelled to stand off and make for Ramsgate, two miles south of Broadstairs. Here the assistance of a tug was procured and the lifeboat was towed to one of the disabled or wrecked vessels. In the meantime, so far as can be learned, two of the vessels that had signalled for assistance had disappeared; it is believed by many persons that they foundered. It is possible, however, that they managed to claw offshore and stand out to sea. It is thought that the lifeboat stood by the remaining vessel and that she took off the crew this morning. At the time the despatch was sent, the lifeboat had not returned. A fishing smack that had lost its bearings ran ashore at Broadstairs. All on board of her managed to reach shore safely. The German ship George, Captain Scholz, from Bremen for New York, which was towed into Dover roads, January 1st, disabled, was seen to be drifting on the shore at Dover during the gale. Tug boats went to her assistance, and it is thought that she was taken out of danger. London, January 3 - The three-masted Russian schooner Sirius, from Grangemouth for Lisbon, has been wrecked at Svanike, Denmark, in the Baltic Sea. The captain was the only one saved. A Master Hall Service, London, January 3, It is stated that the London & Northwestern Railway Company is negotiating with the company owning the packet plying between Holyhead and Kingstown, with a view to arranging the boat and train service as to expedite the delivery to and from Queenstown of the American mails. This action is taken in order that Queenstown may the better compete with Southampton, from which latter place the steamers of the American lines sail. The express steamers of the Hamburg-American and the North German Lloyd lines also call at Southampton. Eighteen Days Out, Halifax, January 3, The steamer Polynesia, from Hamburg eighteen days, bound to Philadelphia with general cargo and sixty passengers, put in here this afternoon short of coal. She met with very heavy gales and high seas to Cape Race. Afterwards, more moderate weather was experienced.

"18940106","NAKIOW ESCAPE OF A CREW A crew of five men had a narrow escape, on the 10th instant, from a watery grave. A small vessel called the Ruby, in trying to reach this harbor from Terranova, was caught in a furious snowstorm. Her sails were torn to ribbons and she was obliged to run before the wind. The seas were running over her and she became heavily crusted with ice. The pumps became choked and the crew were almost exhausted in trying to keep her afloat by baling out the water with buckets, many of them being frostbitten. Hope had almost been abandoned; in a few hours she must have gone down in the awful sea that was running. At this critical time another small vessel was sighted and though in a dangerous condition herself, with sails carried away and men frostbitten, the crew managed, after desperate efforts, to get all the Ruby's men on board just in time, as she sank soon after. The singular thing was that the Pixie, the rescuing vessel, had herself been driven out of Trepassey Bay by the storm, had her mainsail and try-sail carried away, and was forced round Cape Race far north, and thus at last was brought in sight of the sinking Ruby just in time to take off her crew. Captain Lake, of the Pixie, deserves great praise for his brave conduct. He and two of his men were badly frostbitten. His own crippled condition and the state of the weather would have been a sufficient excuse for declining the risk of attempting a rescue, but the brave men never hesitated, they saw their brothers in dire distress, and at the risk of their lives they saved them from the jaws of death. PIERRE News has been received from St. Pierre of a sad disaster at sea, resulting in the loss of seven lives. The schooner Gracie, of Prince Edward Island, on the 10th instant, in a blinding snowstorm, drove on the Savoyard, the southwest part of the island of St. Pierre, became a total wreck, and seven men, comprising her crew, were engulfed in the raging billows. The captain's name was Terence Farrell. Only two of the bodies had been recovered at the latest accounts, those of the captain's brother and Doherty the mate. DROWNING ACCIDENT A few days ago, two boys lost their lives in Quidi Vidi Lake, close to St. John's. In skating they ventured on ice too thin to sustain them, and though the accident occurred only twenty feet from the shore, they sank and were drawn under the ice before it was possible to get any means of saving them, their names were Alfred Simins, son of the late Dr. Simins, and Joseph Smallwood. POLITICAU In an analysis of the returns of the late election contest, the Herald (organ of the Opposition) points out that 10 of the members of the late House were reelected, of whom 15 are on the Government side and 4 on that of the Opposition; and that 17 members have been elected who were not in the last House, of whom 8 sit on the Government side and 9 on the Opposition benches. The total number of votes cast was 77,103, of which the Government party secured 39,505, and the Opposition 38,398, leaving only a majority of 1,107 in favor of the Government. The Tribune (Government organ) has been strenuously urging the appointment of Sir William Whiteway as Governor of Newfoundland, our present Governor's term of office expiring in another year. One would naturally suppose that a Government would be anxious to retain its leader under whom a signal victory has been so recently achieved; but, if the telegram correctly expresses the views of the party, this is not the case. They wish him to be made Governor, possibly because they think that in that position he would be able to stabilize their rule, and give them a stronger hold upon the country; and, no doubt, they are right in such a calculation. But then, in passing from the political arena to the calm precincts of government office, Sir William would be bound to cast off all his old political likes and dislikes and to leave behind him all old animosities and prejudices and party feelings, and to deal with both parties in an equal and impartial manner. This is no easy achievement even in the case of the best men to leave their former self aside. Not improbably, the imperial Government might hesitate to make the appointment referred to on the ground that he has been too long involved in our fierce political conflicts and is too hot from the field of battle to strip himself of all his political belongings. Yet such an appointment is ""on the cards,"" in these days of localization in government; but though Sir William's friends might earnestly desire it, it remains to be seen whether the Colonial office will consider it to be in accordance with their traditions and usages, and in all respects desirable. The appointment of Sir Ambrose Shea is still fresh in people's memories, and the storm of opposition it raised on the ground of his having been a ""native"" and a local politician of long standing. Much might be urged in favor of a local governor, who knows intimately the wants and wishes of the people and who may be supposed to know also the secrets of political generalship and the various ""tricks of the trade,"" so that if so disposed he could help to keep corruption within narrower bounds on the principle that ""a reformed thief makes the best policeman."" A stranger coming among us requires some time to understand the institutions of the country and the position of parties. Much may be said on both sides. The decision may be calmly left to the wisdom of our Imperial rulers. Of course, the Opposition organ fiercely opposes the appointment of Sir William, and regards it as disastrous to the best interests of the country, and predicts that were it carried out he would carry with him to his new office all the old political animosities ingrained by years of conflict with his foes and all his narrow prejudices. Probably neither the amount of good or ill predicted by opposing partisans would be realized did he vault into Government House."

"18940112","R. Wright, Buffalo, January 11. John L. Sullivan played his ""Man from Boston"" at the Court Street theatre last Saturday night. After the show he fell in with a party of convivial spirits. He reached the Till's house about 3 o'clock Sunday morning and the porter helped him upstairs to his room. Mrs. Sullivan was waiting for John, and as the porter walked away, he heard her telling the big fellow just what she thought of such goings on. Clerk McCreedie was behind the desk. He was vastly surprised a quarter of an hour later when a white robed figure rushed up to him and hysterically screamed, ""Bring a doctor! Bring a doctor! I'm Mrs. Sullivan, and John is dying!"" The clerk and porter hurried upstairs and found the redoubtable John on the floor of his room. He was gazing steadily at the ceiling, but could not see it, for he was as senseless as the Indian club that lay beside him. Mrs. Sullivan had followed the clerk, and again begged him to call a doctor in a hurry. When a physician arrived he found the big fellow had been knocked out. It took half an hour to bring the Man from Boston back to Buffalo and his senses. Then he put John to bed, and John went right to sleep. Mrs. Sullivan was very much frightened, and while the doctor was trying to bring around her distinguished spouse she told how it all happened. She said John began to row with her when he came in, and she lost her temper. She picked up an Indian club from the floor and gave John a love tap on the head. But either the club was heavier than she thought or she hit harder than she intended, for the once champion of the world dropped like a log. Everybody concerned in this playful connubial incident was sworn to secrecy. That is why the story has just leaked out. ""Will Set a License,"" Jacksonville, Fla., January 11.

Winnipeg, January 11. Winnipeg last night experienced one of the most severe wind and snowstorms it has known for years. Telegraph, telephone and electric wires suffered much damage, but damage to property was comparatively small. Although the weather was not cold, the lowest point touched by the thermometer being 10 below zero, there were two storm fatalities. Robert Mills, an old man of 60 years, was caught while walking across the prairie, and losing his way in the darkness, died from cold and exhaustion, his body being found near Headingly this morning. Mills was for many years in the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company at Winnipeg. The second victim was Jimmy McChorister, a notorious police court frequenter. He was found dead with an empty whiskey bottle beside him. In a stupor caused by liquor and cold he had lain down on a vacant lot in the outskirts of the city and death had found him an easy victim.

The record of snowfalls, kept at the Experimental farm since 1890, shows that the record for yesterday was twenty-two inches in the twenty-four hours. The next highest record is ten inches on December 15th last year, and in the three previous winters the greatest fall at one time did not exceed eight inches. The last great storm here was in 1885, when the snowfall was about eighteen inches, but it was snowing almost continually for three days. The train service has been thoroughly demoralized both east and west and for the first time in its history the electric car service in the city was knocked out for a while. Not for long, however, for the company had over 500 men at work with four sweepers and nine ploughs with the result that tonight the entire line is open again with cars running on time, and the streets through which the lines run scarcely show any trace of the immense downfall, nearly all the snow having been carted away. Gangs were working all night last night and every man who wanted a day's work today had it. There are not many men in Ottawa just now out of work, but to those who are the two or three days' shoveling which the storm will cause is a positive Godsend. The storm is reported as being unusually severe throughout the Ottawa valley and Eastern Ontario. The roads are impassable and trains are either cancelled or delayed for hours. Below the Bee, River du Loup, January 30. A terrific snowstorm, accompanied by easterly gales, has been raging here since 3 o'clock this morning, the wind blowing at a velocity of 40 miles an hour as reported by the signal office at Father Point. Trains blocked all over. The express trains which left here this morning were the last trains started. They have not reached Levis yet. One is at St. Pierre and the other at Montmagny. The accommodation which left here last night stuck at St. Francois and blocked the line. Engines and a plough were sent from Levis to assist it, but at 10 o'clock tonight had not reached St. Charles yet. The storm is now abating, and there are good prospects of having the line cleared before morning. The Grand Trunk trains which left Montreal last night and this morning only reached Levis late tonight. Telegraphic communication is almost interrupted. Out of seven wires only two are working west of here. In the Maritime Provinces, Ilviu, January 30. The storm which commenced about midnight last night soon developed into one of the worst experienced in this city for years. The fall of snow was not so great as during the big storm three weeks ago, but the wind blew harder and the snow drifted more and packed in very solidly in places. Some of the streets were very much blocked. At ten this morning rain commenced falling, and for three hours came down in a lively manner, violent gusts of wind carrying it along in sheets. The slush was knee deep. The wind gradually died away this afternoon. There was a very heavy sea on in the harbor, the water going right over some of the wharves, and slight damage was done to a few vessels. The wind reached a velocity of nearly forty miles an hour.

There is nothing but a heavy snowstorm that could cause any inconvenience, and even that would cut a sorry appearance with modern appliances for clearing it away. With a splendid quarter-mile track there could be no dispute as failing to count for wind at the back and other things that make to spoil records, and it is safe to say that never before has such a collection of world beaters ever met each other as will be seen on the M"
"18940212","Y on February 15, 10 and 17. The Mille Bodies races will take place on February 21st and 22nd. The Ottawa Races, Ottawa, February 11. The horsemen who were at Montreal last week, as well as about fifty others, are patiently waiting for the bell to ring out the horses at the initial performances at the ice-meeting tomorrow afternoon. The meeting is going to eclipse all previous ones. And it will not be a surprise if the club makes a better record than ever. The members maintain that they will give the best races in Canada and if hard work and lots of money can do it they are certain of being successful in the end. A force of men were kept at work all last night battling with the thaw and snowstorm, and they were eventually repaid for their efforts, as this morning the track was like a billiard table. All the horsemen are pleased with it. Tomorrow's events will include a 2 mile cat and local race. THE RACING. K. Delaney, after a short illness. He was well known all over the provinces as a promoter of and shareholder in joint stock companies. He was about 50 years of age. A Kansas Blizzard, Kansas City, Mo, February 11. One of the fiercest snowstorms ever known in this section began at noon today and is still raging. The local signal service officers say it will continue throughout the night. Traffic on all streetcar lines was blocked by six o'clock this afternoon, but tonight some of the lines have partly cleared their tracks. Evening trains from all directions centering in this city were from one to four hours late, a condition that is rapidly growing worse. Reports from many points in the West indicate a very general storm. Mmlila's Commercial Treaties, Berus, February 10. The Russo-German commercial treaty was finally signed by the representatives of the two contracting powers today. St. Petersburg, February 10. It is stated that the Russian Government will give notice to France that the Franco-Russian commercial treaty will be terminated at the end of 1894 if France persists in putting into effect against Russia the proposed new duties on imported grain.

"18940213","St. Catharines, February 12 A terrific wind and snowstorm has prevailed here most of the day and is still raging. The electric street railway car line is knocked out and traffic generally demoralized. London, London, Ont, February 12 The storm today was the severest that has visited this city this winter and was made up of wind, sleet and snow; it completely paralyzed business. The wind reached its greatest velocity about noon and prevailed with undiminished strength for the remainder of the day. Comparatively little snow fell, but what there was was blown into drifts about the sidewalks and pavements. On the eastbound railroads trains were running a little behind time owing to the storm. Niagara Falls, Niagara Falls, Ont, February 12 The worst snowstorm of years struck town this morning. A regular northeast gale blew the snow in all directions. Towards evening the gale reached a terrific force, piling the snow up in piles eight to ten feet deep, completely suspending traffic on the streets. The horse cars to Drummondville shut down for the night early in the afternoon. The electric lines on both sides of the river, after fighting the storm, gave up in despair. The railways are having their hands full trying to keep their lines open for passenger traffic only; passenger trains on all the lines are running from three to five hours late, freight traffic being abandoned. Hamilton, Hamilton, February 12 A genuine blizzard struck here today. A snowstorm, accompanied by a very strong northeast wind, has been raging nearly all day. The electric service is entirely suspended and street traffic generally is much impeded. Trains east and west are pretty well on time and from the north and south the service has been kept up fairly well so far. Windsor, Windsor, Ont, February 12 The Windsor, Sandwich and Walkerville street railway lines were tied up by the storm about 10:30 this morning, and the cars stand in the street where they were deserted by their crews. Traffic and business of all kinds is almost entirely suspended. The ferry boats are almost deserted and it is almost impossible to make a landing on the other side. The water in Detroit River is rapidly backing from the lakes below and has risen nearly three feet since yesterday, the current being at a perfect standstill. It is almost an impossibility to run the car ferries, and trains on all roads entering Windsor are several hours behind time. THE AMERICAN END It began in Kansas and ended in the Atlantic. Chicago, February 12 The worst blizzard that ever struck this city, so far as the weather bureau records show for twenty-three years, is raging here. Street traffic is greatly impeded and walking is accompanied with great danger to life and limb. Many persons have already been injured by being blown to the ground, against walls and street posts by the wind. The velocity is eighty miles an hour, the highest ever recorded for this city and almost double the velocity of the wind which is blowing a blizzard in the Western states. The wind was so furious at the corners where skyscrapers are built, especially the Monadnock annex block, bounded by Jackson, Van Buren and Dearborn streets and Custom House place, that extra policemen gave all their attention to the pedestrians. Dozens of women were lifted off their feet and blown to the ground, or else pushed across the streets until they came in violent contact with walls, posts and other obstacles. Mrs. Brahany, of No. 361 South Clinton street, a charwoman at the Art Institute, was lifted in the air and dashed against the fireplug of the Dearborn and Van Buren street corner. Two of her ribs were broken, and it is believed she is internally injured. She lay in the snow drift until men rushed to her rescue, and the police ambulance took her home. The gusts of wind and blinding particles of snow frightened men as well as women from attempting to cross Dearborn street at Van Buren. The feet of others kept them within sheltering doorways. Civilians and policemen became a volunteer brigade, and on the principle that in union there is strength, they locked arms with the belated police workers and crossed in safety. At the stockyards there was a practical suspension of business all the morning. No buyers were to be seen. Stock trains were late, and when they did arrive were covered with snow. In the suburbs the storm was felt with rather more severity than in the heart of the city. One of the big front windows of the Leland hotel was blown in early this morning at the very beginning of the storm. The glass was blown clear across one of the parlors by the force of the wind, but the window was boarded up before any serious damage was done by the snow. The drifted snow and the high wind played havoc with the mail. Nearly all the mail trains were late, and from some of them no tidings were received until late in the day. All the roads suffered, both the eastern and western trains being from one to eight hours late. The driving snow made signals on the railroad tracks practically useless, and caused a collision between two freight trains on the West Shore tracks near 97th street and Stoney avenue about noon. Luther J. Webster, fireman on the second train, had his foot crushed. More accidents were reported to the police today resulting from the high wind. In spite of the fearful weather and the condition of the streets the ambulances were kept busy a large part of the day. Bloomington, Ill, February 12 A violent snowstorm raged throughout central Illinois all today. The snow is ten inches on a level, and is badly drifted. Many trains are delayed, and one passenger train on the Big Four is stuck in a drift near Tremont. There are drifts here five feet deep. Indiana, Fort Wayne, February 12 The great blizzard reached this city at four o'clock this morning and is still raging. All streetcar traffic was abandoned at an early hour. Every railroad centering here is blocked and traffic is practically suspended on all lines. Wabash, February 12 The heaviest snowstorm of the season raged here yesterday and today. The wind blew sixty miles an hour. The thermometer was below zero and the suffering among the poorly clad and half-housed people on the big prairie north of here is fearful. New York, Sabana Lake, Y, February 12 The worst storm of the season is now raging here. The thermometer has dropped 42 degrees in four hours and now registers eight below zero. Snow is falling and aided by a terrific west wind is drifting badly. New York, February 12 The city tonight is covered with a mantle of snow several inches thick. Travel of all kinds is greatly impeded. The storm is the most severe one of the season and is expected to last until tomorrow night or Wednesday morning. The thermometer is down to 20 degrees, and the wind is blowing from the northeast at the rate of thirty miles an hour. Railroad traffic is almost demoralized. All trains are behind time, and the mails from the south and west are greatly delayed. The ferry houses are blocked with belated passengers waiting for the overdue ferry boats, which are compelled to run at a considerably reduced rate of speed. The elevated railroad trains are delayed. The effect of the snow is felt on the outskirts of the city, and the markets are stagnated by the lack of farm produce, the roads being almost impassable on account of deep snow drifts. Sergeant Dunn, of the weather bureau, said tonight that this storm was but the advance guard of one more severe, which would be followed by a very cold wave. Danger signals have been ordered up all along the coast and vessels have been warned not to leave port. At the rate the snow is falling tonight it will be a foot deep by the morning. Reports from all points throughout the state indicate that the storm is general and very severe and that traffic is greatly impeded; trains are badly delayed everywhere. Dispatches from New Jersey report a similar state of affairs. The storm along the New Jersey and Long Island coast is particularly severe. A high northeast gale prevails, and the air is thick with flying snow. Mariners off the coast will have a hard night of it. It is probable that several wrecks will be reported tomorrow. The life-saving crews have doubled their patrols and are on the alert so as to promptly answer signals of distress. One wreck was reported tonight. It occurred on Rockaway Beach, opposite the Arverne hotel. The Arverne life-saving crew cannot go to the relief of the vessel on account of the blinding snowstorm and the high and heavy sea which prevails. The vessel is stranded some distance off shore, and her size or the crew she carries cannot be ascertained. The fate of the crew is in doubt, but their position is an extremely dangerous one. Nebraska, Omaha, Neb, February 12 Nebraska is snowbound. For the past twenty-four hours a terrific blizzard has prevailed throughout the state. The fall has been about twelve inches and, following the eight-inch fall of snow on Thursday, makes the depth at least twenty inches. The cold is extremely severe with few exceptions. Omaha traffic of every description is suspended. Trains in every direction last night were abandoned. The mail trains are being got through with difficulty. The high wind has been piling the snow in great drifts. Reports from the interior show stock is in good condition and farmers are pleased with the immense snowfalls, as it assures a fine winter wheat crop. Ohio, Cleveland, February 12 A severe wind and snowstorm from the northwest struck this city this morning. Nearly all trains are late. Streetcar traffic is almost entirely suspended. Fhf, mont, O, February 12 In a blinding snowstorm, which had been raging all morning, freight train No. 40, westbound, and eastbound light freight No. 25, on the Wheeling and Lake Erie railroad, collided two miles west of Bellevue about 10:30 o'clock. Both engines and several freight cars were smashed and piled up in confusion. Engineer Connell, of light freight No. 25; Fireman McMullen, of engine No. 25; Brakeman Johnson, of freight engine No. 28; and Engineer Samuel Stowell, of engine No. 28, were killed. Missouri, St. Louis, Mo, February 12 Without warning from the weather bureau a veritable Kansas blizzard struck this city at 11 o'clock last night and continued up to 6 o'clock tonight. Rain, hail, sleet and snow alternately swept over the city before a high wind. At daylight the street railways had abandoned efforts to run cars till the tracks were cleared by snow plows. All the railway trains that were not abandoned entirely were late, the Alton express from Chicago being eight hours behind time. The snow is four inches deep, which is phenomenal for this latitude, as time passed the storm increased in severity and at 2 p.m. the wind had risen to a 30-mile gait, with the thermometer 8 degrees above zero and falling. The casualties are numerous, but none serious. The overhead wires look like masses of white ropes and many have been snapped by the weight of ice. Two horses were shocked to death by coming in contact with a broken live wire. Telegrams from all points from the South and West show that the storm is widespread and disastrous. Mississippi, New Orleans, February 12 Advices received here today and tonight indicate that a storm approaching in violence a cyclone is raging in Mississippi, and that the town of Newton has been wiped out of existence, but as the telegraph wires are all down full particulars cannot be obtained. Memphis, Tenn, February 12 A special from Jackson, Miss, says: A terrible cyclone passed between Martinsville and Beauregard, 40 miles south of here, at a late hour at night within a few miles of a patch of the terrible cyclone of April, 1884. The cyclone was about a mile wide and everything in its path was leveled. A great many houses were swept from their foundations, trees twisted off, fences destroyed, several people killed and a great many seriously injured. Kansas, Kansas City, February 12 The worst snowstorm in years raged all over Kansas and Missouri last night and today, for not a single train was on time. The snow averaged from one foot to two feet on the level. High winds accompanied it, and at some points it is 20 feet deep. In many sections schools were closed today. In towns with street railways the service was paralyzed. The snow was dry and the telegraph service was not injured. Topeka, Kan, February 12 All railroads in Kansas are blockaded with snow and scarcely a wheel is turning in the state. Vessels Ashore, Long Branch."
"18940214","THE FOCUS ON BATH, ME, February 13 Most of the buildings of the Bath Iron Works lost by the fire of two weeks ago were burned early this morning. This great plant is now practically destroyed. In the machine shop was probably the finest shipbuilding machinery in New England, embracing all the modern improvements. The loss is placed at $175,000. The fire started at 2 o'clock this morning from the smokestack in the engine house. A driving snowstorm prevailed and the flames spread rapidly. The steamer Frank Jones was saved by a shift of the wind, after being badly scorched. The two upper shops, where the iron work was done, as well as the carpenter shops and wood-working buildings, with their contents, were burned. Each of these buildings was three stories high. The works were but one thousand feet from the Maine Central depot, which at one time was threatened. The firm was getting out the wood and iron work for a new steamer. At 3:30 o'clock the fire was under control. Treasurer Hyde, of the iron works, says the firm will not rebuild, but will probably locate in New London, Conn. All of the buildings along the waterfront were burned. The office was not burned, but was badly damaged. The northern part of the works was saved, but all in a more or less damaged condition. COLLIERVILLE, TENNESSEE, February 13 Yesterday fire destroyed the Bank of Collierville and two dry goods stores. Loss: $300,000. SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, February 13 This morning a fire broke out in the Central Hotel and spread to St. Leonard's Hotel, totally destroying three large buildings and damaging the million-dollar courthouse now under construction. The indications are that the fire was of incendiary origin. Insurance about $50,000. Loss: double that amount. STRATHROY, ONTARIO, February 13 About 4 o'clock this morning fire was discovered on the second floor of the Albion Hotel. Though hard to get at, it was kept inside the building, and the loss by fire was confined to a comparatively small space. The western half of the building was, however, thoroughly deluged with water and the loss from this source will result in a considerable amount. The building is insured for $13,500 and the furniture and stock for $5,000. TOLEDO, OHIO, February 13 A number of stores were burned at Genoa, Ottawa County, last night. Loss: $100,000. OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA, February 13 The Great Storm Causes Much Suffering in Oklahoma. TRAFFIC IS RECOVERING From its Fire. The Storm in New York State and in the Niagara Peninsula Very Severe. Kansas City, February 13 Reports received here today from Oklahoma and the Indian Territory make it almost certain that at least 30 lives were lost during the great storm of Sunday. Many isolated homesteads where the families were poorly prepared for the winter cannot be heard from for days and possibly weeks, and there is reason to believe 30 will not represent the total number of dead. In Western and Southwestern Kansas there was great suffering, and it is probable that in more than one sod house dead bodies will someday be found. OKMULGEE, OKLAHOMA, February 13 The worst of the great blizzards seems to be over here and business is again resumed. Four trains that have been snowbound near Red Rock, in the Cherokee Strip, for thirty hours, came in early this morning. Besides two families reported frozen near Groves, an unknown man was found near the Ponca Indian Agency frozen stiff. Near Stillwater a man was frozen to death under his house and south of Cleveland, in County Q, a family of three persons perished. Two Tonkawa Indians are reported to have been found dead in Alma, and near Andarka three Indian children, who were caught out in the storm, perished. There are rumors of many other fatalities, but so far they have not been confirmed. Scores of cattle and horses perished in the strip, and in the big pastures in the Osage and Kiowa reservations, the number of dead cattle will reach thousands. EL RENO, OKLAHOMA, February 13 The storm of Sunday was the most severe in twenty years. There is much suffering to man and beast everywhere in this section, but only a few fatalities are reported in the immediate vicinity. Three Indian school children lost their way in the heavily falling snow and perished Saturday night. In the sparsely settled and inland towns west of here the suffering and fatalities are greater than in any previous winter in years. Overland mail routes are blockaded and all communication is cut off by lines to this city from the West. All railroad traffic is impeded. IN NEW YORK STATE, NEW YORK, February 13 The snowstorm yesterday and today was characterized at the office of the local weather bureau as the severest of its kind that has visited this city since the memorable blizzard of 1888. Last year was exceptional for its many and heavy snowstorms, but no individual storm of 1888 equaled this one in severity. Exactly one foot of snow had fallen by 8 o'clock this morning, and there was a fall of two inches more by 11 o'clock."
"18940216","B, February 15 A heavy easterly snowstorm set in this morning and up the St John river. The wind tonight is almost hurricane. Major-General James Kilner, whose wife died about three weeks ago, was carried off today by paralysis. He was born in Middlesex, England, in 1807, and when 21 years of age went to India as lieutenant and continued in active service in the army till 1858, when he took up his residence at Fredericton. Five children survive him, three daughters in Fredericton and two sons in Toronto. The stream of returning exodians is now swollen by many New Brunswickers who have been discharged by the Missoula Mountain Lumbering Company. John W. Stroud, of Wm Stroud & Sons, arrived in St John last night, and put up his horse at Hamm's stables, having driven all the way from Montreal, striking through Quebec from River du Loup to New Brunswick and following the St John river from Woodstock to this city.

"18940217","B, February 10, Yesterday's heavy snowstorm blocked almost every branch railway in the province and seriously interfered with the trunk lines. To-night a furious gale is blowing in St. John and throughout this section of New Brunswick with the mercury down below zero. The snow is drifting into large piles and is filling up railway cuttings faster than the ploughs can be operated against it. A train which left Fredericton yesterday morning only reached here to-night, and between Fredericton and Woodstock several passenger trains are stalled by the snow. Reports from many parts of the province state that this last snowfall has practically put an end to operations in the lumber woods, the snow being too deep for hauling. There is much suffering in many districts, through the highways being impassable for teams, the food supply for both animals and man being very short. Despatches from St. Stephen to-night state that the Canadian Pacific railway branch to that town is totally blockaded and like reports have come in from St. Andrew's. So far the Intercolonial has got through much better than its great competitor. The Kent Northern railway management is trying to dig through twenty-seven miles of snow drifts."
"18940222","ORION IS HEARD FROM Again Sides with Col. HongMon Against Gen. Middleton BE DETAILS CONVERSATIONS Which He Had with Gen. Middleton and Which the Latter Denies Ever Occurred-More Serious Points Toronto, February 21 The Mail publishes the following special from Winnipeg: The Tribune publishes an interview with Dr. Orton today, in which he replies to Gen. Middleton's denial of what he and Col. Houghton had said. For Instance, said Dr. Orton, General Middleton said he had no interview with me on these matters. As a matter of fact, we had two. I went to him at the request of Col. Houghton and Col. Williams. I then expressed my indignation at the idea of going back onto the prairie, as I felt that our retirement of a mile and a half at Fish Creek, in a blinding snowstorm, had something to do with the death of one or two who had died on that occasion. I also said that I felt that even that retreat was a mistake, as was afterwards proved, because the rebel rifle pits were found to contain bullets of clay, demonstrating that the rebels then were absolutely out of ammunition. Had Col. Houghton been allowed to charge into the valley, as he desired, there would have been no Batoche. Upon expostulating with General Middleton, he at first became angry and threatened me, but upon my earnestly representing to him the bad effect it would have on the Indians of the whole Northwest, and upon my telling him that he would be held responsible for any deaths that should occur should he force me to take the wounded back to our previous camping grounds on the prairie, he said: Well, Orton, if we are to stay here, then I will hold you responsible for what may occur, as you have no right to speak as you have done. I acknowledged that I supposed I had not, but I felt intensely on the subject. Afterwards, when the English engineer officer, whose name I at this moment forget, was riding around to make arrangements for forming a zariba, I asked him where I should place my wounded, and he also said: Orton, you are responsible for our staying here, thus endorsing what I have said on the subject. I also look upon General Middleton's treatment of Colonel Williams and Colonel Houghton, and perhaps some others of our Canadian officers, as disgraceful, considering the position they occupy. It is a well-known fact that Colonel Williams, when sick, refused to go off duty, stating that General Middleton would only make some slurring remarks. At least, so I have been credibly informed, and Colonel Williams repeatedly told me, while I was with him, that the General seemed jealous of him and acted most unfairly toward him. Perhaps General Middleton will also deny that he, after the taking of Batoche, made little or no attempt to capture Riel, and that I interviewed him on the matter on the evening of the day after Batoche, at the request of Col. Williams, who, with myself and other officers, felt very indignant that Riel and Dumont should, to all appearances, be so glaringly given every opportunity to escape. He will probably deny that I interviewed him on this second occasion, telling him of the dissatisfaction that existed in the ranks. When he said: What can I do? I said: You know better what ought to be done than I, but I suppose you can send all the scouts and mounted men in pursuit, and by rewards get half-breed scouts or others to give information as to Riel's whereabouts, and upon the General stating that he had no power to do anything of the kind, I said, You have the telegraph office not very far from your tent, and can soon obtain authority from Ottawa, and if you don't telegraph, I will. He then used very violent language, and said if he were Sir John Macdonald he would tell me it was none of my business. I said: It is my business. I am one of Sir John's supporters, and he must know what is going on here, for if this inaction is intentional I cannot continue to be his supporter. I then went from his tent and wired Sir John Macdonald as near as I can remember in the following words: Intense dissatisfaction at no attempt being made to capture Riel, both among officers and men. If something is not done, count me out. Wire Middleton. In the meantime Col. Williams and myself agreed to offer $1,000 for the capture of Riel, and $500 for the capture of Dumont. One of the scouts to whom this reward was offered is still living in the neighborhood of Prince Albert, and will, no doubt, verify what I say. When we stopped midway between Batoche and Grandbois crossing at noon, I passed by General Middleton's tent, when he called after me by name, Orton. I felt indignant at his conduct towards me the night before, and I paid no attention to his call at first, but walked on. He sent his orderly after me, and I went down, when he said: You seem very proud. Did not you hear me call? I said: Yes, sir, but I did not think it necessary for us to have any further conversation. Well, he said, I thought you would be glad to know that I am going to immediately send out every available man to try and capture Riel. I replied: I am glad, but think it should have been done over 24 hours ago."
"18940322","SOLDIERS IN TOWN They Will Arrive this Morning from Quebec and will have a March Out (From our own correspondent) Quebec, March 21 For the first time since the Imperial Government withdrew its garrison, a detachment of regular troops passed through here to-night en route from England to the Pacific coast. Unusual as was the event, it attracted but little attention and very few people, and not a single soldier were on hand to welcome them. The detachment consisted of 55 men of the Royal Marine Artillery under command of Major Rawatone. They came out by the Allan steamship Laurentian, arriving at Halifax on the 20th instant, and after a somewhat long but not unpleasant passage, they arrived at Levis shortly before 5 p.m. and crossed by ferry in the midst of a heavy snowstorm. The men were in heavy marching order, with overcoats strapped and without any protection from the weather other than the waterproof cape covering their shoulders. They, of course, wear the artillery uniform and white helmets, and the only difference between them and our own troops is that they wear white woollen gloves and have no spikes in their boots to give them a foothold in the snow. In spite of this, they marched as steadily as if they had been accustomed to snow roads all their lives, although by their sunburned faces it was clear that they had been accustomed to warmer climates than that of Canada. They are fine, tall, well-built men, every one of them, and would be a credit to any service. A more soldierlike body never trod the streets of Quebec.

"18940324","EE-ECHOES OF THE PRESS, Easter Lilies, pure and fair and sweet, I know that hidden in your hearts of gold still lies the secret you each year repeat An old-told story that can ne'er grow old. I hear the bells that ring, As o'er the earth now steals the Spring I know not why it is, but every year The story seems more wondrous strange and new; I bend above my lily-buds to hear Thou whisper softly what I know is true: That Winter's past; That Spring comes fast; That life and joy are here at last! The story that the Easter lilies toll Brings light and peace to the whole world today; And hearts bowed down by grief and sadness swell In songs of praise, and even doubters pray. Men can be brave, For, strong to save, Our King has triumphed o'er the grave! Sing out, O lily-bells! Gone is all gloom! All nature sings at this glad Easter-tide, We see no more the shadow of the tomb: To us the pearly gates swing open wide! Fast is the plan; Death is in vain: He who was dead now lives again! Virginia Van de Water, in Harper's Bazaar, Australian Gold Nuggets, Some big nuggets of gold have been found in New South Wales. Among the principal were a mass of gold found on the Turon River gold fields in July, 1851, and which weighed 100 lbs, or 1,272 oz. In November, 1858, at Burrandong, near Orange, another nugget was found which, when melted at Sydney mint, gave 1,182 or, Cdwt, of pure gold, of the value of £4,381 8s 10d. A third nugget, called the Brennan, was sold in Sydney in 1851 for £1,156. In 1880 and 1882, several nuggets which were unearthed at Temora weighed from 50 to 131 oz, and in 1887 nuggets were found by fossickers in various parts of the country, four of which, weighing respectively 357 oz, 200 oz, 47 oz, and 32 oz, were obtained at Hargraves; and another, weighing 30 oz, at Limestone Creek. The Jubilee nugget, weighing 344 oz, was also discovered in that year at Maitland Bar, in the Mudgee district, and was worth about £1,236. Religion In New England Town, Early in this century the Congregational society of Middleboro, Mass, had grown to such strength that it was able to build the meeting-house which now stands on the green. Daniel Webster, riding by, used to raise his whip, point to its Ionic columns and its generous porch, and declare it the stateliest building in the commonwealth. Seventy years ago, on any Sunday, fair or stormy, you would have seen gathering the entire population of the neighborhood. Together up the aisles of the meeting-house, families took their way. Every townsman was in his place. Neighbors saw neighbors, and felt the inspiration of common interests expressed in common worship. Together their hymns and prayers went up, and when the minister took his place in the high pulpit, he looked into the faces, not of a party held together by some peculiar notion or practice, but of the whole town. In the morning, the women in the great porch, the men on the benches in the burying-ground, kindly talked of the neighborhood concerns, the public policy, the conduct of the government, the improving methods of agriculture, commerce, and industry, went on. Here, while the minister sought unction for the afternoon hour-long prayer and longer sermon, among his people fellowship was warmed, mutual understanding of citizens was accomplished, friendships were cemented, troths were plighted, society was made a Christian society. At present there are in the town 3,000 church members, belonging to eight different churches, and 4,600 persons who have no affiliations of any sort with any religious body. There were last Sunday in the fifteen churches of the town less than twelve hundred people; that is, for every three persons who went to church there were seventeen who did not go. Most of the religious societies are in debt; every church is of wood, and several of the organizations have neither a church nor a hope of ever having one. The congregations are few, dwindling. When there is an immersion at the Baptist church, or when a converted Turk gives a magic-lantern show there, pretty nearly all the people become Baptists. When the Congregationalists announce, by a large placard on the street, a concert by the town band, they may always expect a crowd. The Methodists pay the salary of their pastor largely by the proceeds of an annual clambake on Labor Day. The first act of the newly-installed Congregationalist minister was to announce a course of Sunday evening lectures on such subjects as: ""The White City""; ""Health""; ""Choosing a Partner""; ""The Burial of an Ass."" Inevitably, though the lowering of the dignity of the services, caused by the competition of the denominations, reverence has disappeared, and the idea of worship has been almost lost. Few, indeed, kneel during prayer; the most that can be said is that nearly all listen, some with respect; after a prayer is done, ladies lean toward their neighbor, and comment on its beautiful passages. It is the most temperate of statements to say that the people do not see Christ's religion in its beauty and dignity. They are led to think of the service of God's house as a performance; the minister who can get up the most entertaining program has the best house. William Hayward Hale, in Forum, Birds That Come and Go, There are some birds that depend almost entirely for their means of subsistence upon the light-winged summer flies that love the sunshine. These the economy our cold season does not provide for. The tree-creepers and the tits, insectivorous in their propensities, are content to seek food in the crevices of bark up and down the branches of old trees, in the cracks of walls, in and out among the stones and bricks of old buildings, peering, probing, pecking at the creatures that have thought to get safely through the cold weather by hiding. Not so our migrant singers. Many of them, like the swallows, eat only such things as they can catch in their swift flight open-mouthed through the air; these are few and far between in the raw and cold atmosphere of winter here. Swift and swallow, nightingale and cuckoo, warbler, wheatear, whinchat, blackcap, wryneck, flycatcher—all the merry troupe of strolling singers, must follow the sun and the creatures that dance in the sunbeams to lands that are sunny in winter. The movements of the birds that come and the birds that go in spring and autumn are prompted by the abundance or scarcity of certain kinds of food among the varied store our land affords. The nomadic wanderings of our resident birds are also foraging expeditions. Only in the spring and the early summer are any birds able to find the food they require in one particular neighborhood. Then insect life abounds, and round about the nesting place enough and to spare is to be found both for the busy parent birds and the insatiable chicks and squabs. But in the autumn and winter there is, strictly speaking, no such thing as a stationary population of birds in any place. Then all turn gypsies and hither and thither wend their restless way, eluding the famine of a frost here, the dearth of a snowstorm there, or the buffeting of stormy winds, by continually moving on. The Cornhill Magazine, Good From The Hooper Trial, One good effect of the Hooper trial will be to impress the public with the fact that, after all, the popular opinion that prussic acid employed as a poison is most volatile, is not grounded upon fact. Had Hal Hooper been found guilty, had the defense, and the Crown experts, not brought forward prominently that prussic acid may be detected in the putrefying body weeks and, it may be months, after death, it is not improbable that prussic acid would have been installed throughout North America as a most useful instrument in the hands of would-be homicides. There might have been an epidemic of cases of poisoning by this substance. We firmly believe that the evidence and verdict will have the useful effect of preventing anything of the kind. We mention this relief, as not infrequently after celebrated murder cases where some little-known poison has been brought prominently into public notice, such epidemics have occurred. Montreal Medical Journal, Taxation In England, An income of £1,000 will not permit its recipient to keep up much style or make any great display, but for the purpose of carrying out the illustration of the English system of direct taxation it may be assumed that the bank manager keeps a horse and carriage, that a boy who wears buttons attends to the horse, and that the bank manager also keeps a dog and is in possession of a gun, with which, two or three days in the autumn or winter, he goes out shooting. Those indulgences will make a serious difference in his accounts with the collector of inland revenue. His total account, irrespective of his license to kill game, will then stand thus: Income tax on £1,000, less £100 for insurance, at sixpence in the pound £23 10s; inhabited house duty, ninepence in the pound, on £100 £3 18s; income tax in respect of property, house of the rental value of £100 a year, at sixpence in the pound £2 10s; armorial bearings £1; use of same on carriage £2 2s; tax on manservant £15; license for dog £1; gun license £10; total £34 10s. This sum of £34 10s would represent the bank manager's contribution to direct taxation. And yet not quite all, for every time he pays his grocer or his butcher by cheque the Inland Revenue Commissioners, by means of their stamp, collect a penny on each and every transaction. When once a man is in receipt of an income of over £500 a year, the collectors of inland revenue are always lying in wait for him. They are with him in his periods of prosperity and in his times of depression. They are waiting to collect a tax when he apprentices his son to an engineer or gives another a start as a lawyer. When he receives a cheque from abroad, tribute must be paid to the Imperial exchequer before it can be placed to his account with the official receiver, nor do these charges end with a man's lifetime. When a man dies probate duty must be paid on his estate and succession, and legacy duty by those who benefit under his will. The Englishman at Home, By Ed. Parritt, The Sailor Slave, Vengeance la galere! And woe to the poor wretches who are feebler or slower than the rest; the keen eyes of the overseers pacing the gangways swoop like hawks, and the lash descends with a hiss on drenched backs and shoulders. Blood trickles with the sweat and drops into the pools. All the interior of the vessel is painted red. On that color blood, whether of fight or of torture, shows less than on another. Six, ten, twelve, fifteen, even twenty, hours at a stretch the great oars wring out this agony of labor. When nature is racked to the limit of endurance, the overseers thrust into the mouths of the famishing victims bits of bread soaked in wine. Then the hoarse voice of the Captain is heard calling for better speed; the silver whistles of the overseers quicken the stroke; the cruel thongs enforce the signal of the whistles. See, here is a miserable being who has fainted. The lash only reddens as the torturer tries to bring him to consciousness. It is labor wasted. Unlock the fetters about his ankles and hustle him overboard! Good Words, The Newspaper Creates Trade, If a man wants to do business with his neighbors to buy or to sell, for instance—he makes the fact known in the newspapers. There is no other way to reach them so thoroughly and advantageously. The business man cannot do without the newspapers and wouldn't if he could. The newspapers create trade, for, while the business man advertises with probably the specific purpose of securing local patronage, the advertisement goes where the paper goes and makes the advertiser known outside his own community. His name becomes familiar and by the influence of the newspaper, trade with him is created where he never expected it, his business is extended and made more important. Harrisburg (Penn.) Patriot, Overworked Talent, Is the ""Talent scheme"" degenerating into a public nuisance? The question would doubtless be answered with an emphatic ""yes"" by some, and with an equally pronounced ""no"" by others. This much, we think, is certain: those who are now busying themselves with ""Talent concerts,"" socials and the like are losing sight of the main idea which animated the originators of this plan of augmenting church finances. The whole thing was based in the first place, as its designation plainly shows, on the parable of the talents, which dealt with the investment of a certain sum of money by several men and their ways of multiplying their respective amounts. The 230 members of St. Andrew's church who introduced the plan in this city did so on the Scriptural lines, each taking a dollar and investing it in such ways that with care and hard work it increased and was multiplied many times. Well, success crowned their efforts; and when the result was announced half-a-dozen other congregations decided to follow suit. How have they fared? In some cases doubtless an honest attempt has been made to carry out the original design, but many have become weary of the more laborious methods of ""increasing their talent"" and have hidden it away after the example of the unprofitable servant. And in order that they may not be behind their friends in the amount of their contribution, they give, perhaps, a concert or a social, and dub it a ""talent"" entertainment, although as a rule they invest no part of their ""talent"" money in it. This is a direct departure from the primary proposal, although it is doubtless taken with the best intentions. Kingston News, A Sailor's Epitaph, Sacred to the memory of Capt.

FROM CANADA TO CALIFORNIA The prospect of escaping the last and most trying part of our Canadian winter was delightful. But as we drove down to the station that bright January morning, I could not help regretting that it was the last time this year that we should hear the glad, happy music of the sleigh bells. So many friends were down to see us off, and all wished to be coming with us, just as we wished to have them. We had written other friends along the line to meet us at various places, and all that first day we held quite a reception, which lasted till we left Toronto at 11:30 that night. And I should strongly advise anyone contemplating a long trip to do as we did; it makes such a pleasant break in the journey. It was late in the afternoon of the second day when we reached Chicago, where more friends met us and assisted us in getting our tickets changed and luggage re-checked, and with whom we afterwards dined. While waiting at the station for the train to be made up, such an amusing little incident occurred. A number of young fellows were down seeing off a friend, who was a Cingalese of high standing so our friends informed us. He was dressed in the American style, but wore his long hair in a Psyche knob, which, however, was almost entirely concealed by his high overcoat collar. Presently a woman with a baby, a birdcage and a handbag appeared on the scene, looking frantically around for a porter, but just then there was not one in sight; however, there stood the Cingalese; he had not the brass buttons, but he was the right color, so she rushed up to him, and holding out the birdcage and handbag said with a strong down east accent and in tones of authority that few would have had the courage to ignore, ""Here, porter, you take these things to the eastbound train, and come right back here for more."" When I have read in novels how ""conflicting emotions struggled for the mastery,"" I have always pictured to myself a face going through the most diabolical contortions imaginable; but now I know that with a perfectly calm exterior a face can express conflicting emotions. Without moving a muscle the face of this young Cingalese expressed astonishment, indignation, embarrassment and finally amusement which came uppermost, though his friends resented the blunder with far too much indignation to see anything amusing in it. It turned very cold in the night, and we noticed such quantities of ice and snow floating down the Missouri River when we crossed it at Sibley Bridge. We followed its course for a while, and the scenery is very pretty, though nature seems all in a brown study just now, but our imaginations could fill in more vivid colorings and we could almost see it as it will be two months hence after nature's awakening when little groups of snowy trilliums will be peeping up from the golden brown carpet of last autumn's leaves, and the well-wooded hills and ravines will be brilliant with the beautiful and varied hues of early spring. Passing over a gully, a lonely tree was pointed out to us, where the notorious desperado, Jesse James, hung a detective some years ago. For half an hour after that the wild portion of country through which we passed suggested all sorts of desperate and thrilling deeds. We reached Kansas City about noon. It was such a surprise to us in every way, but then I so often find that our preconceived ideas of places differ very much from the reality. With so much level space at hand, how did they ever come to choose such an odd site upon which to build a city? It is so terribly up and down hill. Houses are perched on the tops of bluffs that drop down seventy or a hundred feet to the street below; and one might go from one's back garden gate to eternity by a single step. One can easily see how, in days gone by, poor unfortunate cattle used to fall off their pastures and break their necks. That was not so very long ago either. In 1800 Kansas City was only a little group of houses and warehouses on a long steep street leading down to the Missouri River, where the boats used to shove their bows up into the mud and remain there tied to a tree while the business of unloading and loading went on. One can scarcely believe that in so short a time such a great city can have sprung up. We stopped just an hour in Kansas City, and the route after that lay along the banks of the Kansas River, which is generously fringed with groves and the country in the vicinity pretty well settled up with farm lands and cattle ranches. About 3 o'clock that afternoon we reached Topeka, the capital of the state of Kansas. It is a very pretty little city, with broad avenues abounding in shade trees, and here the scenery ended for that day, and part of the next. Never shall I forget the unspeakable monotony of those dreary plains. And yet, here and there along the route, we came upon desolate little villages, and sometimes a single dwelling miles from any other. How can people exist there I wonder? And yet, I suppose life is just as sweet to them as it is to other people whose lot is to dwell in more beautiful spots upon God's earth. But it seems to me that I would far rather be lying in one of those lonely graves we saw, just a stone's throw from one of the isolated little dwellings; or like poor unfortunate Sir Alexander Selkirk, ""Better dwell in the midst of alarms than live in this horrible place."" At one time, centuries ago, this vast plain was the bed of a great inland sea, where within recent years very interesting discoveries have been made of remarkable fossils of colossal animals, elephants, mastodons, gigantic horses, sharks, crocodiles and more ancient aquatic monsters of frightful appearance and unspeakable names. These interesting fossils are to be seen I believe in the National Museum. Our route so far had been a gradual ascent, so that when we reached Colorado we were traveling over a plateau 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. We first traversed the southeastern portion of that state, and here again our preconceived ideas we found to be very much at variance with the reality; in fact, this time they received quite a shock, for instead of the balmy climate where consumptives are restored to health, and the magnificent scenery we had read so much about, this portion of Colorado is the most desolate waste imaginable. Nothing to be seen from the track to the horizon on both sides but cactus and sagebrush, while off to our left towered mighty cliffs and mountains of beautiful Arizona Sandstone, in all shades of terra cotta and old rose. And were I a theosophist I would firmly believe that the architects of the old world had visited this region in the astral body and reproduced in a limited degree these magnificent specimens of nature's architecture in their grand old cathedrals at home. Such a succession of rounded domes, rows of pillars, and airy turrets, stretching far up into the blue sky, quite overwhelmed us with wonder and admiration. There is one huge cathedral-shaped rock standing out clear and distinct in the sunshine called ""Navaho Church,"" which is believed by some people, and is spoken of in some guide books, as an actual ruin. But it is simply a tremendous rock that remained standing, while the greater portion of it was torn down in some convulsion of the earth. The fantastic shapes of these rocks and mountains are accounted for, first, by the action of the water for it must be remembered that this was once a vast sea and, since then, by the fierce sandstorms that literally smoothed off those domes and pillars, as if by a chisel. Just before coming to the ""Devil's Canyon"" we went to the rear platform of the car and for several awful seconds hung suspended above that horrible abyss. It is simply a hideous gash in the face of nature, extending for several miles across the plains five hundred and forty feet wide and two hundred and twenty feet deep, and lined with sharp jutting rocks. One comes upon it quite unexpectedly, for there is nothing to indicate its existence, even a few feet away. It was caused by a contraction and cracking of the earth's surface in cooling; and if it were possible to close it up, the projecting crags on one side would fit pretty accurately into the notches on the other. My little niece wanted to know why it was called the ""Devil's Canyon,"" and not satisfied with the explanation given, ventured with her usual originality upon an interpretation of her own. ""All those sharp, dreadful rocks are teeth, and I know it is called the 'Devil's Canyon' just to show how the devil can yawn."" After that, as we ascended to Flagstaff a station nearly seven thousand feet above sea level the scenery unexpectedly changed into beautiful pine forests, not very thickly wooded, which continued for many miles and through which we saw one of the most beautiful sunsets one could imagine. The tall pines stood out black as ebony against the ruddy sky, which cast a pinky reflection upon the town, which again repeated each tree in a very elongated form. The whole scene was weird, unearthly and beautiful in the extreme. The air was very still away up there, and such a sense of peace and solemnity pervaded the whole place that the presence of our noisy train seemed a desecration. ""Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,"" the place seemed fitted only for the abode of spirits of that bygone race, who, centuries ago, inhabited the cliff dwellings, which are to be found only a few miles away. So much of interest has been written about these long abandoned abodes of a pre-historic people, and yet, how little is actually known. The implements and utensils found in them are much the same as those in common use among the Pueblo Indians today, and also correspond with those articles unearthed from the works of the Mound Builders, east of the Mississippi, the only difference being that wooden articles found here have been cut with a stone axe, which only suggests a greater antiquity. But these facts open up a world of conjecture as to the civilized race that spread over this vast continent centuries before our ancestors were conquered by Julius Caesar. During that night we made the descent of between six and seven thousand feet from Flagstaff to the ""Needles,"" the last station in Arizona, so called from the sharp peaks to the left before coming to the Colorado River. We awoke to find ourselves in California, and here our elaborate preconceptions received the rudest shock of all, and as the day wore on we firmly resolved that in future we would take places as we found them, and not form any fixed ideas concerning them. However, they told us that the only approach to the California of our dreams except by the sea was through weary miles of desert. The Great Mojave (pronounced Mo-ha-vey) desert it is called, and in comparison with which the prairies of Kansas seemed almost pleasant and refreshing in retrospect. How those white patches of alkali dazzled us in the scorching sunlight, and how we longed to reach the other side of that mountain range, in the blue, hazy distance, but as hour after hour flew by—or I should say dragged on—it seemed to recede as we advanced, reminding me of poor Oliver Goldsmith when he says ""Impelled by steps unceasing, to pursue fame, feeling good that mocks me with a view, That like the circle bounding earth and skies, Allures from far, yet as I follow flies."" When evening came on we were still in the desert, but during the night we missed some beautiful mountain scenery, and also I am glad to say about twenty tunnels. We awoke on that last morning of our long journey, to find ourselves in the California of our dreams, blue, sparkling water with graceful white gulls hovering over and dipping into it on one side of the track, and green hills and lovely gardens on the other. How refreshing they seemed after our long journey, and that terrible Mojave desert! And if January is so lovely what must March be? When the fruit trees are all in bloom and the country is ablaze with yellow poppies. But here I am again anticipating, when former experiences should have taught me that ""Blessed are they that expect nothing, for they shall not be disappointed."""
"18940404","S, April 3 Two steamers bound to New York from Europe put in here this morning short of fuel after very rough experiences in storms. They are the Storm King, Captain Crosby, from Hamburg, via Shields, and the Italia, Captain Craig, from Mediterranean ports. The Storm King sailed from Hamburg March 15 and put into Shields on the 20th for coal, sailing from there the same day. After leaving the latter port she met with heavy head gales and high seas, experiencing cold weather and snowstorms, the latter part of the passage the ship becoming somewhat iced up. Four icebergs were passed, one in latitude 50°15'. The Storm King sustained some damage about the deck by being boarded by several heavy seas, the rails and stanchions being broken. She has a general cargo. The Italia, Captain Craig, sailed from Naples March 8th, and from Gibraltar on the 13th with 280 passengers, all steerage. She met with fair weather up to the 23rd instant, when a terrific hurricane with a high sea was encountered, during which the ship received pretty rough handling, but came through without much damage. She passed two icebergs in latitude 42°30'. During the passage one birth occurred. The Italia belongs to the Anchor line. DEMANDS A TRIAL.

"18940405","THE CANADIAN PACIFIC The statements submitted at the annual meeting of the Canadian Pacific Railroad Company were of a nature to be satisfactory both to the proprietors and the country. The year 1893 was one of disaster to American railroads. The record of bankruptcies among them included many of the greatest systems on the continent, affected over 30,000 miles of track and involved a loss to owners and investors difficult to calculate. The Canadian Pacific felt the depression also; but as it was very slight in Canada compared with the state of affairs over the border, so the decline in the company's earnings was comparatively moderate. The gross earnings of 1892 were $21,109,351; those of 1893 were $20,902,317. The net earnings last year were $7,741,416, against $8,420,347 in 1892. The beginning of the year was unfortunate, heavy snowstorms and severe weather making the work of operation difficult and expensive. The fair result of the harvest was offset by the exceedingly low prices ruling for grain. The trade depression curtailed travel and reduced the quantity of freight offering. This affected both the company's own lines and its allies to the west of the Great Lakes, the latter most severely. It also tended to reduce the demand for the company's lands. The work of improving the road's capacity and facilities, however, was not stopped. Five hundred and thirty-seven timber bridges, in united length over nine miles, were replaced with permanent work, and on 81 more the permanent work was partially done. On 188 miles of track heavy steel rails were relaid. Work on the Revelstoke and Temiscamingue extensions was prosecuted. The branch to Eganville was completed. A connection was made with the western extension of the Booline, at the international boundary, giving the united roads the shortest route between the Pacific Coast and St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Chicago. The road was never in a better position for securing and carrying traffic than it is today. Its roadbed and equipment are alike of the best, and its management vigorous and efficient. The immediate prospects are improving. British trade is on the mend. Despite the tariff uncertainty, that of the United States is getting better. The world's wheat markets show signs of recovery from the unprecedentedly low rates that have been ruling for many months now; and the report estimates that there is yet a large amount of the grain in the hands of farmers and in local elevators on the line. Its being marketed will give the road traffic in both directions, through the demand it will create for general merchandise, which has been reduced owing to the enforced economy the holding back has necessitated. It will also increase the demand for the company's lands, it being noted that the chief sales are made to persons who have already established themselves in their neighborhood, and who purchase most largely when business is good. The branch lines being completed, especially in British Columbia, will add to the traffic of the main line. The company's telegraph, express, sleeping car, and steamship departments have maintained or increased their routes. The China and Japan steamship line has been so satisfactory that it is proposed to add a new height boat. It is, of course, possible that the depression may not pass away at once, and that Canadian, as other roads, may for some time suffer from its effects; but it must pass away ultimately, and in the not distant future, and in the meantime, with its satisfactory position as to equipment and finances, the accumulated surplus earnings amounting to $7,261,215, there are few roads better able to await the outcome than the Canadian Pacific. Someone has been counting Congress and finds that in the two houses there are 74 ex-Union soldiers and 76 men who fought in the Confederate ranks during the war. The influence of the ""Rebs"" is greater, however, than their numbers. While the Union soldiers in the two houses control 10 committees through the chairmanships, the Confederates control 44. The Speaker pro tem of the Senate, Mr. Harris, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Crisp, also served under the Stars and Bars. All of which leads the New York Commercial Advertiser to exclaim that ""the South is in the saddle"" again, which is one way of looking at it. Another way is to think that, perhaps, the South sends the best men to Congress, as it did in antebellum days. An institution like Tammany, for instance, is not likely to be a good judge of statesmen, and it picks out a good many of the North's representatives. It was pointed out in the report of the directors read at the C"

He was associated with the co-operative movement in temperance work and has spent four years on a plantation owned by his wife in Georgia, and spent the most of his time while there in endeavoring to evangelize the Negroes. Lord Rosebery paid a visit to Mr. Leigh in Georgia during the Premier's visit to the United States some years ago. Lord Rosebery's bay filly Ladas stands in an excellent position in the forecasts of the Derby, and his bay filly Orle is a candidate for victory in the Thousand Guineas and the Oaks and is heavily backed. His Lordship's chestnut colt Uavelston, also entered in the Derby, has recently lost favor. Ladas is a favorite with many, and if she should win the Derby, it would greatly enhance the Premier's popularity. The Social Purity Association is reported to be engaged in shadowing nightly the movements of a number of prominent members of the House of Commons, cabinet officers and other distinguished persons, their detectives being instructed to keep a minute record of everything they discover bearing upon the morals of the persons shadowed. This information is being gathered with a view to its use in the next general election. A minor society paper mentions Lord Rosebery as having recently taken a midnight wander through the remote quarters of Islington and Camberwell, whither he had gone to study the social undercurrents. An English-African initiative has been undertaken with a view of checkmating the designs of France and Belgium, who are aiming to obtain access to the Upper Nile. The English expedition is also aiming at the Upper Nile and will reach the objective point before any expedition from Uganda can get there. In May, the whole of Unyoro and Benin's province will have been brought into the British sphere. The expedition will start from Lando, north of the equatorial province, and Colonel Colville, its commander, has been given the very widest scope of action. A renewal of the coal miners' strike is impending. The representatives of the miners on the Conciliation Board resent the action of Mr. Haands in giving the casting vote against the demands of the men, fixing the minimum rate of wages, regulating the selling prices and permitting them to inquire into the profits of owners. For this action, Mr. Haands is denounced as an aristocrat, humbug, etc. The consensus of public opinion is that as the miners have accepted the proposal to settle their grievances by arbitration, they ought to abide by the decision of the arbitrators. Reports in currency matters estimate there will be a considerable rise in the price of silver under the influence of a revival of trade with India which must considerably increase the demand. The Statist, in a review of the situation, concludes that within India free to buy 30d will be the minimum and 35d the maximum price. If the mints are reopened the range will be from 35d to 40d. The Government intends to appoint a commission on India coinage which will be composed of a number of experts in matters of coinage and includes several members of Parliament. THE COLONIAL PARTY, Vital Importance of the Proposed Pacific Cable to the Empire, London, April 7. At the conference yesterday evening with the colonial party in the House of Commons Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, premier of Queensland, addressed the meeting at length. He insisted upon the vital importance of the proposed Pacific cable, and urged that its construction should be the joint undertaking of Great Britain and her colonies. He declared that nothing would bind the Empire more closely together, and asked for Imperial aid towards the proposed line of steamships. On Wednesday a deputation waited upon the Marquis of Ripon, secretary for the colonies, when Sir Charles Tupper, high commissioner for Canada, introduced the subject of a subsidy for the projected line of steamers between Canada and Britain and aid for the Pacific cable, both of which would remove many obstacles now preventing the colonies from trading with each other. Sir Thomas Mcllwraith and Hon. Robert Reid, trade commissioner from Victoria, supported the contentions of Sir Charles. Both Lord Rosebery and the Marquis of Ripon expressed sympathy with the proposed enterprise, but were very cautious in their replies, and would not commit themselves to any definite pledges. They said it was desirable to await the result of the Parliamentary conference at Ottawa. They also expressed the necessity for a cautious treatment of the subject, as trade relations between the mother country and the colonies had an important bearing on the trade between Great Britain and the foreign powers. Fast Atlantic Service, Sir J. Colcomb has written another letter to the Times, in reply to Mr. Samuel, in which he admits the desirability of a fast Atlantic mail and Pacific cable service, but contends that the basis of the arrangements for the carrying out of the projects is not fair to the British taxpayer. Sir George Baden-Powell, in another letter, reaches conclusions precisely the opposite of Sir John Colcomb's, and expresses the belief that the Imperial Government will finally decide in favor of co-operation with the colonies. The comments of the papers generally are favorable to the Pacific cable scheme. Hamilton Strike Settled, Hamilton, Ont., April 7. Several conferences have been held yesterday and today between the Ontario Rolling Mill strikers and the officials of the company, and as a result it is likely the men will return to work on Monday. President Doolittle said the strike was practically settled, and although he refused to divulge the exact result of the conferences he stated that a compromise had been offered by which a slight increase of some of the lines on the new scale of wages was granted. Mill be a Lively Time, New York, April 7. The Herald says: There is now no longer any doubt that there is to be a bitter war between the Vanderbilt, Olyphant and Cannon factions of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company at the annual election to be held on May 8. There will soon be two tickets in the field with each party actively canvassing for proxies and a great deal of counter politics may be expected between now and the day of the meeting. The Government as Grain Merchant, Berlin, April 8. Count von Kanitz-Podangen was supported yesterday by 182 deputies when he moved in the Reichstag to give the Government a monopoly of the purchase and sale of foreign grains intended for consumption. According to his proposal, the Government would fix a minimum price of sale. Was On the Ice, St. Johns, Nfld., April 8. The steamer Walrus arrived today with ten thousand seals. She has both sides stove in amidships. She was crushed by the ice and is leaking badly. She had much difficulty getting home and her reports are not so favorable as those of former arrivals. A Portland Liquor Raid, Portland, Me., April 7. The deputy sheriff made a raid last night on the Durant house, the property being owned and managed by Col. Fred N. Dow, son of General Neal Dow. The house is considerable liquor was seized. Mrs. Swett, who was arrested, and Co. Enright, Parliamentary secretary to the Foreign office, declared that British merchants are entitled to the advantages of the Russian-German commercial treaty under the most favored nation clause. The Barcelona's Narrow Escape, St. Johns, Nfld., April 8. The steamship Barcelona, from Liverpool via St. Johns, arrived last night.

"18940410","B, April 9, St. John today experienced the worst April snowstorm it has known for thirty-four years. The streets were blocked and business largely suspended. The storm, which began about midnight Sunday, raged with unabated fury all day. The air was full of snow, which was whirled into drifts five and ten feet deep. The schools suffered severely, and the few scholars that turned out were sent home at the noon hour. Over sixteen inches of snow fell during the day and it was of that wet kind which stuck wherever it touched. All attempts to clear the sidewalks were abandoned towards nightfall as useless. Tonight it is colder with a high wind. The street railway did not have a car out, and the Bay of Fundy and Boston steamers did not leave their moorings. The Short Line railway did not send out any trains, but the other railroads are running fairly well on time. The storm was confined to a small area, being comparatively light at Fredericton and Moncton."
"18940412","WOULD ANNEX HAWAII No Haja Ex-President Harrison, as to Keep Other People Out Ban Francisco, April 11 Ex-President Harrison, in the course of an address at a reception given him by the Union League club last night, said: ""I hold that our revenue laws should be so framed as to keep American mills open and not shut them. I believe it is worth our while to build a navy, and incidentally to have a coaling station within easy reach of our country, somewhere in the Pacific. I do not want to annex the world and I have not been much of an annexationist, but when I find a spot which must be taken by us or someone else, thereby securing a station of the utmost importance to the United States, I say let us take it in."" The ex-President said it was strange there should be so much distress now. ""Whoever had done it or however it came about it is un-American and should be repudiated by the people."" He said he had never looked for other results under the policy of the present Government and scored tariff legislation. COXEY'S ARMY Marches Uphill in the Snow and Feels Very Tired Chai Hill, April 11 To-day the Commonweal army marched twelve miles over the mountains and most of the way through eight inches of snow. To-night it is encamped at an old continental mansion within one mile of this point. The march was almost heroic, six miles of it up over laurel ridge of the Blue Ridge mountains being accomplished in a snowstorm. Both the men and horses were almost exhausted by the terrible exertions of the trip when the summit of the mountain was reached, but as the camping place was six miles ahead it was necessary to force the marching to reach it before night. At the foot of the mountains a halt was called for lunch. Horses were fed and the men given a dozen water crackers each for the meal. Then the command pushed on, reaching Camp Brownfield at 5:30 p.m., where a hot supper was served. They were a pitiable looking lot, many wearing seersucker vests and being without overcoats. The start from Uniontown was late, as the commissary wagons were about town all morning gathering up breadstuff and meat for the march. During the march to-day a drunken member of the Commonweal attempted to steal one of the horses, but the horse was captured and the man sent from the ranks. While halting for dinner the men made a demonstration against reporters who passed by greeting them with groans and threats of various kinds. Some time ago the men boasted that they would do harm to the ""war correspondents"" when the mountains were reached. They objected greatly to being called tramps. To-morrow they will march fourteen miles to Petersburg. Cohen, Utah, April 11 The Industrial army will proceed east. There has been great suffering among them. About Freights and Steamships To the Editor of the Gazette: Sir, Messrs. Allan and Torrance were quite justified in protesting against the Mulock bill, in placing a fixed rate for the transportation of cattle shipped by their lines, from Canadian to European ports. That would be a very great injustice to those steamship owners. These rates, I should judge, are largely governed by the season of the year in which they are shipped, and the weight of the cattle. In my judgment, I think the Ottawa Government should have first treated with the Messrs. Allan, with regard to the fast Atlantic service. We Canadians, and especially the Government, should remember that the Allans are the pioneers that have borne the heat and burden of the day, and at a time when they labored under many disadvantages. They are the ones that should receive the subsidy from Canada and Great Britain. They are the proper parties to place and control the Atlantic greyhounds on our Canadian route. They have the experience, knowledge and skill, by their indomitable push and forethought they have established one of the largest, safest and most prosperous sea-going fleets that the world has ever known.

Packers are doing all they can to work prices down and the local trade is scalping with them. There is very little outside support and until that comes we may see a dragging market. The hog product is selling on a basis of less than 41 cents for hogs and ought to be an investment; packers are responsible for the depression. New York reports 14 loads for export, and Baltimore 10 cars. A despatch from Chicago says: There was talk here that half a million of wheat was taken here yesterday and today for shipment. Messrs. Clapp & Co., of New York, write as follows in their weekly grain circular: Oklahoma grew about 800,000 bushels of wheat four or five years ago, and imported wheat. Now Oklahoma grows ten times as much and exports millions of bushels. The Argentine grew less than home needs but a few years since; now South American crop is about eighty million bushels, and the coming year may exceed one hundred million bushels. United Kingdom imports last year were one hundred and seventy-nine million bushels, the United States furnishing one-half the supply; Russia 17.2 percent, and India 11.5 percent, or but one-half what the Argentine furnished. Russian growers get about 37 cents for 100 pounds; India from 35 cents to 37 cents; the Argentine about 35 cents in gold. France may grow her home needs for the first time in a score of years. October report of Government statistician will give Great Britain's requirements above home crop as 182 million bushels, and that of all Europe above total European crops as about 110 million bushels. The world's bushels of all kinds of grain likely equals or exceeds annual consumption, or any previous crop grown. The visible supply usually reaches the maximum point about January 1. The official visible at nineteen points exceeds 75,000,000 bushels. Reports from all possible points report 30 million bushels more. The greatest discoverer of the age reports wheat as yielding 50 percent more than corn when turned into pork. A recent English authority reports the feeding of wheat cannot be profitable exceeding a small percentage. A Northwestern correspondent says: Speculative farmers report neighboring farmers are feeding large quantities of wheat. Home millers here are grinding 51 bushels of wheat per barrel of flour, disposing of the offal at a better remuneration than if ground into lower grades of flour. Speculation appears dormant or growing more bearish. Average weekly exports are about 3 to 3.5 million bushels per week. The feeding of wheat and other grain is probably near the maximum point. We now favor conservative buying, accepting moderate prices until our export demand is more aggressive. The Winnipeg Commercial says: The tendency in the Winnipeg market has been toward lower prices. At the close of last week 56 cents was paid for No. 1 hard, Port William delivery, which includes elevating charges, this firmness being due to stoppage of country deliveries by bad weather. Prices have materially reacted this week and close about 54 cents, Fort William delivery, with easier markets abroad and freer deliveries here. In Manitoba country markets the tendency of prices has been in the opposite direction, and at many points prices were advanced 1 cent to 2 cents, while an advance of 5 cents was reported in one country market. Prices to farmers at country points are more irregular and range from 39 cents to 45 cents in different markets. Deliveries by farmers at country points, which were stopped last week by stormy weather, were resumed this week, but there was still unfavorable weather in some sections to retard deliveries. There was a phenomenal snowstorm on Saturday a week ago in the Territories, extending into western Manitoba, but there was no snow in the eastern and central sections, and only a light sprinkle of rain at Winnipeg. The snow and rains have delayed threshing fully a week in the west, and made roads bad. Freight rates from Fort William to Ontario points west of Toronto, by the regular lines, have been advanced 1 cent to 8 cents per bushel. The new rate goes into effect on October 15. The rate from Duluth to Buffalo is 21 cents and 4 cents to Kingston. Lake rates from Fort William to Buffalo are usually a fraction over Duluth. Receipts at Fort William for the week ended October 6 were 808,767 bushels, and shipments 448,843 bushels. Stocks in store 1,391,915 bushels. A year ago stocks were 708,092, being an increase of 160,000 bushels for that week. A firmer feeling prevailed in the local grain market today in sympathy with primary markets, and prices in some cases were a trifle higher. In Manitoba wheat, business is quiet on spot, there being little inquiry from exporters owing to its poor quality this season. In peas a fair trade was done at 66 cents afloat and 68 cents was bid for some round lots, but the holders refused to sell at this figure. Oats changed hands at 34.5 cents to 34.1 cents. Manitoba oats are offering here afloat at 33 cents. The demand for buckwheat was fair and sales of several small lots amounting to 5,000 bushels were made at 48 cents per 48 lbs. No. 1 hard Manitoba $600 to $603. No. 2 hard Manitoba $600 to $610. No. 3 hard Manitoba $600 to $600. Peas, per 66 lbs, afloat 66 to 66.5. No. 2 oats, per 31 lbs 84 to 85. Corn, duly paid, 68 to 70. Barley, feed, 46 to 47. Barley, malting 60 to 63. Rye 49 to 50. There was a good inquiry from abroad today for flour, and as cables were stronger at an advance of 6d over yesterday's, some business was done. The Lake of the Woods Milling Company reports a sale of 4,000 sacks. The demand on local account was fair and on the whole a more active trade was transacted at steady prices.

NEWS FROM OTTAWA: A Talk with the Gentleman Who Cleans Smutty Wheat PACIFIC CABLE TENDERS Opened Yesterday Receipts and Expenditures for October Hudson's Bay Railway Minor Ottawa Notes (From our own correspondent) Ottawa, November 9 Mr. AT EODSLEY'S Wild words wander here and there, Tennyson. Sir Edwin Arnold is a very interesting and a very exasperating personage. A journalist from Fleet Street, with all the literary traditions of London at his finger-ends, and with all the keen shrewdness which his profession ought to have developed in him, he yet revels in foreign sights, sounds and ideas; praises inferior civilizations; cherishes a practically immoral and anti-Christian society; wonders why people will prefer the European to the Eastern atmosphere; exaggerates in the most grotesque manner the peculiarities of strange places and people; and in fine dwells, either actually, or for amusement merely, in a land of topsy-turvy and proclaims it a beautiful country till we are disposed to declare him non compos mentis and hand him over to the care of his friends. We have on previous occasions called attention to his letters and to the mistakes he made concerning our own country. These mistakes make one suspicious of an author. If he does not understand what he sees in Quebec, will he quite understand what he witnesses elsewhere? If he misrepresents the political conditions of Ontario, will he be likely to give us an accurate account of the social condition of Honolulu? Sir Edwin Arnold is of course no more inaccurate for example than Mr. Froude, who imagined that he had to come from the United States into Canada across Lake Erie on the ice; but he has exhibited some weaknesses in that direction. He has just published a handsome volume entitled ""Wandering Words,"" consisting of letters to the Daily Telegraph and articles in American and English magazines. The frontispiece consists of the inevitable collection of pretty-faced Japanese females of whom all Sir Edwin's readers are tired, and some suspicious. The attempt to impose these over-dressed dolls and expressionless nonentities upon civilized people, as types of beauty and models of conduct, is just downright impudence, nothing less, it is an insult to credulity, an offense to Christianity, and unfair to the social traditions of his own country. The very first of his ""Wandering Words"" is entitled ""An Earthly Paradise,"" and is taken up with a description of Honolulu. Now, Honolulu is not a paradise, except, perhaps, in point of climate. If it is a paradise, the population is mainly of serpents. Sir Edwin Arnold says: ""Of course we have passed every available hour of our detention here ashore, and seen enough to wonder why people dwell in the changeful latitudes of London and New York when they might breathe the heavenly air of these ocean paradises and life in the perpetual Garden of Eden which nature has laid out for her happiest children in these hollows and uplands."" Now, this is inexcusable rant! People prefer to live in London and New York because life is there more interesting, more useful, more intellectual, more helpful, more in accordance with a high civilization, than life in Honolulu. Even a poet ought to be able to possess sense enough to see this. Nature's happiest children are not found in Honolulu, we may be sure; and if Sir Edwin finds these happiest people in the Kanakas, he has evidently not been ""ashore"" long enough to get acquainted with them. A Kanaka girl in what seems to be a night-gown adorns the pages. We hope Sir Edwin is not going to add the Kanaka Brownie to the putty-faced Japanese as sister types of beauty! One of Sir Edwin's most interesting chapters is entitled ""In the Holy Land,"" and we read the following statement concerning himself with a good deal of natural curiosity: ""When I was at Nazareth I purchased the seven acres of wild rock and ruins on that hill the exact spot where our Lord 'opened the book and read' hoping to found a small hospital there; and at first my humble enterprise prospered. But the Greek and Latin monks quarreled about it; difficulties intervened; the sailing ship which carried the beds, fittings and inscription stone went down at sea. The project had to be abandoned. Latterly, however, it has been revived with new hopes and efforts; and just before leaving England last year, I agreed to make over the Sultan's firman, which I still held, to those who are again endeavoring to establish the Katherine Arnold hospital."" That is news to us. It tends to render us naturally more friendly to a man who can thus at once cherish the memory of his dead wife and endeavor to do some practical good in the land of holy traditions. In this essay also Sir Edwin Arnold seems to express himself more like an Orthodox Christian than he does in some other quarters. His account of the Dead Sea as a bathing place savors somewhat of personal hostility, for he calls it hell-broth. And he winds up with a humorous account of an Arab Sheikh who offered a whole string of camels for Miss Arnold (his sister) to be the Sheikh's wife. The offer was declined; but at least it will be strung the lady's remembrances of her conquests. Sir Edwin tells us that as a boy he was fond of the sea. Who has not been that has been born within the sound of it? But his ambitions in the direction of being an admiral were not destined to be realized. ""I read too much,"" he says, ""I was over-successful I should say today sadly successful, except for the beautiful poetry of Homer and Virgil, of Shakespeare, and Keats, and Shelley, of Aristotle, and Tasso, of Calderon, and Lamartine, of Dante, and Hafiz, and the dark wisdom of the Sanskrit Upanishads and Mahabharata which came afterwards, and are more mighty and delightful than even the ocean."" That little touch about Hafiz and Sadi and the Mahabharata brings us back to where we started, viz., the exasperating character of Sir Edwin Arnold's apparent passion for things which are Oriental and are not influenced in any degree by the Christian civilization, which after all is the noblest we have any knowledge of. It smacks strongly of affectation to thrust his Japanese women upon our notice as types of beauty, and to ask us to ascribe any beauty to the Upanishads, when he knows that but half a dozen people in England have any knowledge of them. Sir Edwin knows a good deal, he also goes into raptures about ""Tent Life"" in India; and tells us how glorious was the sleep in the tent after a long day's ride in the sun. ""Inside the clean, cool pretty tent, with its Persian carpet and jumble of camels, guns, rifles and saddles, the glimmering lantern shed a faint light, enough to show if thief or snake entered; scorpions and centipedes you could not always keep at a distance."" Now it requires a good deal of audacity to ask us to admire a life in which one's evening rest is qualified by thieves, snakes, scorpions, centipedes, owls and jackals! Sir Edwin may sleep very sweetly under canvas in such conditions as these, but none of his readers could do so. We have at hand another book of Eastern travels entitled ""A Diary of Journey Across Tibet,"" by Captain Hamilton Bowyer, 17th Bengal Cavalry. It is dedicated to Lord Lansdowne, through whose support and patronage the journey was carried out. We have had of late a considerable number of volumes of travel in these regions by French princes and English soldiers; and we have very little doubt at all that the foreign office has given some encouragement to the projects. It is very naturally an object of some consequence to know the condition and character of the country and the people of a region which is a borderland and may be a boundary. We do not know of any more uncomfortable country to travel in than this Tibet. The snakes and centipedes of India might perhaps be preferable to the frosts and snowstorms of Tibet. ""This book,"" says the author, ""is the plain, unvarnished diary kept during my journey across Tibet and China, written often with half-frozen fingers in a tent on the Chang, or by a flickering light in Chinese rest-houses."" He was writing, however, only for those who are interested in geography and travel, and did not pause to polish his style. We have all of us, however, a preference for some degree of style in every volume, and do not look on half-frozen fingers in China as an excuse for a half-frozen style in London. Lord Dunmore, in his book on the Tamils, led us to think that this region was the ""roof of the world."" Captain Bowyer puts this claim aside, and says that the Chang, or great Tibetan plateau, is by far the highest and largest plateau on the face of the earth; compared to it, the Pamirs, the so-called ""roof of the world,"" sink into insignificance. We rather dislike to have a new and rather attractive geographical idea such as ""the Pamirs"" sink into insignificance so soon and so completely; but in this age of rapid scientific development we shall not be surprised to read in the Daily Telegraph that Captain Bowyer's Chang sinks in its turn into insignificance before some plateau grander still. The company was curiously mixed; two Englishmen, a Hindu surveyor, a Pathan orderly, a Hindustani cook, a Kashmiri, and six Argoons. An early discovery was made that in this stronghold of Buddhism, the pure doctrines of Buddha had been considerably mixed and modified by merely mundane considerations. Pure religion everywhere is no doubt compromised by imperfect human conduct. The very nomads of these wild regions have learned to lie, and bargain and cheat in a way that would astound even a Wall Street operator. They required high prices for listing as guides, and they show quite a cunning and shrewd objection to letting strangers come into their country. This country will soon attract travelers of a certain kind; for Captain Bowyer declares a part at least of it to be a sportsman's paradise, certainly for antelopes and yaks. The party were detained by their guides on the 20th July at an altitude of 17,501 feet, even the money payment they were to get not being sufficient to overcome their unwillingness to go on with the strangers. The ease with which such desertions took place and with which animals strayed away during the night showed a lack of warmth on the part of the travelers. But guides as well as natives are treacherous and all dread the introduction of strangers into the land. These travelers had all the difficulties that Bonvalot had and that Lord Dunmore also experienced in getting on in their journey. Passports were not of much use so long as they were not respected. Bonvalot indeed states, if we remember rightly, that private instructions are given to the proper officials in these remote regions to disregard all kinds of passports and to give strangers as much trouble as possible. Thus, at Lhasa the Tibetan officials produced a letter that had been sent after them from Lhasa in which they were instructed to take no notice of any Chinese passport, but send us back the way we had come. Of course they did not go back; but by dint of purchasing officials, and bullying a little and waiting a good deal, they got on. A reminiscence of the character of the Chinese people is given here, which the events of the war now raging in the East further illustrate. ""Close by (Ichang) a remembrance of the disturbances that had occurred a few months before was to be seen in the blackened walls of the mission buildings burnt down by the rioters. The Chinese are a people of indomitable valor when several thousand of them are pitted against a few unarmed missionaries, but their valor is of a kind that evaporates wonderfully quickly in front of a few rifles in the hands of determined men. After they had destroyed the mission house, in a fit of elation, they rushed to the Custom house, but there a surprise party in the shape of eight Europeans with rifles, accosted them a denouement as disagreeable as it was unexpected; so the valorous rabble quietly melted away. Lord Rosebery's fears of a massacre of Christians by a beaten and disorganized mass of Chinamen enraged against all the world may possibly be wise and proper fears, though his conduct in endeavoring to put an end to the fighting has been denounced by his opponents. It ought to be remembered that Lord Rosebery was almost exclusively welcomed by his opponents to the Foreign Office, on the ground that a purely Imperial policy would always find support from him. He has not suddenly lost his head, and ought not therefore suddenly to forfeit confidence. We have, we may say, searched in vain for Captain Bowyer's scientific reasons for his expedition. Beyond the already well-known facts that the country is cold, sparsely populated and hard to travel in; that the people are dirty, lying, avaricious and treacherous; and that Tibetans and Chinese alike hate all foreign travelers and would murder them if they dared, we do not see that he has added anything to our stock of ideas. He has refreshed the stock, but not added anything of consequence."

"18941115","Hogan, son of Mr. Henry Hogan, of the St. Lawrence Hall, who has just arrived from his ranch at Pincher Creek, Alberta, was interviewed by the Gazette yesterday on his experiences in the great Northwest. ""Our ranch,"" said Mr. Hogan, ""is thirty miles from the Canadian Pacific branch road at McLeod. It is a splendid country, but it is not adapted to extensive farming. Of course, farming on a small scale is all right, but what the country is adapted for is range cattle, and that alone. There is lots of water, but there is very little rain, and this militates against the raising of large crops. There is no rainfall in summer, and the winter lasts about three months. The thermometer drops to as low as 40 below zero two or three days at a time. We have severe snowstorms, but the Chinook wind comes along and removes it in a very short time. The Chinook is a warm wind which blows over from the Pacific coast and melts the snow in short order. I have seen weather there in January fully as warm as your September weather here. The business this year on the ranges was ahead of last year. There was ten thousand head of cattle rounded up for shipment, and these delivered at the cars averaged $35 a head for three-year-olds and $45 a head for four-year-olds. This is a big sum when you come to think of it. Liverpool is the great market and occasionally London. The cattle are mostly Shorthorns and Herefords with some Polled Angus. In 1893 the number of head shipped was about seven thousand, and I think that 1895 will see the record of 1894 beaten. The majority of the settlers in Alberta are English with a very fair representation of English-Canadians. ""It requires some capital to go into ranching, and no man need attempt it with less than eight or ten thousand dollars. The territory is fairly well settled, but the ratio is about twenty males to every female in the population. There is plenty of timber in the Rockies, not far from us, and streams are plentiful. As for politics, we are too busy to think about it where we are and have to work too hard."" Mr. Hogan will spend two months in Eastern Canada before returning to the Western wilds."

The Laurentides is to be the name of a new park instituted by the provincial Government, covering some 2,500 square miles of the unsettled territory to the north and east of the Bettle district around Quebec City. The purpose is to make the park a place for the preservation of large game and the study of forest growth. A smaller tract in the township of Grandison, in the eastern part of the province, has also been set apart as a sanatorium. The Government's action will receive general commendation. Ontario a few years ago took a similar step, which was in line with the action of the Dominion in instituting the Banff National Park, and was widely praised. The Ontario park area has also been added to since it was created, like bee has much land, not suitable for agriculture, which could not be put to better purpose. The generation of today has learned that there is health in the forest primeval, and there will be few better samples of it than are included in Quebec's Laurentides park. It will be sure to bring visitors, for it is not only large and attractive, but it is easily reached. Conservatives in London, where the election contest has waxed very hot, find fault with Mr. Hobbs, the Liberal candidate, because he is a very poor speaker. The charge appears to be just one. It is doubtful, though, if its establishment will do Mr. Hobbs much harm. Usually when a Liberal is nominated for a parliamentary or legislative vacancy his ability to add to the debating power of the party is heralded as one of his main qualifications. A few Liberals have gotten into Parliament and the printed debates have as a consequence swollen into two immensely bulky volumes that nobody reads, so that nobody knows exactly what they are all about. A Liberal representative who knows enough not to talk may take with the electors, as a novelty, the pedestrian Wilson, who left his boots in Montreal, just beyond Winnipeg met a snowstorm which landed him in a ditch where he was glad to stay for an hour. He describes it as a blizzard, but the inhabitants say it was only a light wind. Anyhow, it was quite enough to knock Mr. Wilson out for the time being, and give him a little foretaste of what he may expect later on. At the time of writing Mr. Wilson had done 1,743 miles from Quebec, and one-fifth of his journey round the world. He will not do the next few hundred miles so easily.

"18941201","FAST ATLANTIC SERVICES, Messrs Allan Key to Commander Wakeham and Sir William Minton, To the Editor of the Times: Sir, To our letter which appeared in your issue of the 31st ult, we appended a short article from the New York Journal of Commerce, which recited the reported opinion of Mr. Smith, the deputy minister of marine for Canada, and that of Commander Wakeham, in charge of the fishery cruisers, upon the proposed fast service. The views of Mr. Smith, in which Captain Wakeham was believed to concur, shortly stated, were that it was folly to represent the navigation as presenting no obstacles to the maintenance of high speed. Mr. Smith was further represented as believing that, as a commercial enterprise, the fast line can never prove a success. The article appearing uncontradicted in a paper of such high standing and the opinions being exactly those we should expect these gentlemen to hold, we had no hesitation in giving it a place in our letter. The dissemination of the views attributed to these officials, differing as they do from those adopted by their parliamentary chief, could not but be distasteful at headquarters, and we are not surprised at what has followed. Captain Wakeham has addressed a letter to Sir Charles Tupper, minister of marine, and its substance was cabled to you a fortnight ago. Mr. Smith, presently in this country, has addressed yourselves direct. As both communications seem to reflect upon ourselves, as well as to contradict what has been stated by the Journal of Commerce, we take leave, with your permission, to comment upon them. Captain Wakeham has assumed that we have attributed to him the opinion that 20-knot steamers cannot be employed in the St. Lawrence with safety, and by this means not only does he find opportunity to contradict the statement, but to imply that we advocate this opinion. We feel aggrieved at the persistence with which it is endeavored to fasten on us the view that it is less safe to employ 20-knot steamers than slower ones. We disclaimed this in our letter of August 16, stating that where it was safe to run at 14 knots it was equally safe to run at 20 (and in this we are at one with Captain Wakeham); but we held that in the weather and waters where this service is to run the high speed cannot continuously, nor to the same degree as on the New York route, be safely maintained, and a trade and subsidy that is to be made and earned by such speed is at serious disadvantage. Captain Wakeham's contradiction does not touch this point at all, and, even with his obviously strong desire to support the views of his chief, his good sense constrains him to add that ""the swift vessel need go no faster than prudence would warrant in thick weather,"" which is really the kernel of the whole question as to navigation. He could not add that climatic conditions, and freedom from navigation dangers, were as favorable on the one route as the other. His everyday experience would contradict this. The published reports of his department would contradict it; the premium of insurance for the St. Lawrence trade would contradict it, and as to the commercial aspect of the question, on which, however, he offers no opinion, the history of the mail and passenger trade of the last ten years would confute him. As to the first, we take a single phrase from the Government Blue-book report for 1890, at page 34: ""From 25 miles east of Belle Isle to abreast of Greenly Island passed innumerable large icebergs and detached pieces of ice."" ""Icebergs were met in the Straits by all vessels passing there this season up till the end of October; innumerable bergs were met with east of the Grand Banks and for 80 miles south of Cape Race."" In one of our letters we mentioned that this season one of our steamers struck an iceberg at 13 knots speed, destroying her bows. What would have happened had the speed been greater? An Atlantic greyhound this season is reported to have, in a fog, run down a barque, herself receiving no harm, the barque and all on board disappearing. Had it been a berg the case would have been reversed. Then as to fog and the fog signals, on which some stress is deservedly set, the department warns navigators in these words: ""It cannot be too emphatically impressed upon them that a sound signal is under no circumstances so reliable as a light, for the best sound signals will give varying results under varying conditions of atmosphere."" Turning to Mr. Smith, whom we hold in the highest esteem, and from whose department the book from which we have been quoting issues, his letter reminds us of the story of Galileo when abjuring before the Inquisition his belief in the earth's motion, muttering ""But it still goes round."" He notices that Captain Wakeham repudiated certain statements, and he ""generally endorses the terms of his contradiction."" We have shown that the statements contradicted were never made. He proceeds that he believes the scheme of running fast steamers is quite feasible, but he adds—and it is here his fairness comes prominently out—that ""the navigation of fast steamers would naturally require the observance of the same precautions as in the case of slower, and the faster need go no faster than prudence would warrant in thick weather."" In an earlier letter we gave an illustration from this year's experience of a fast boat because of fog only going 190 miles one day and 71 the next; she was in company with one of our slowest boats for five days, unable, owing to the fog, to utilize her speed. We also mentioned how we had to stipulate in a mail contract that we were to be free to slacken speed or stop for fog and ice and thus lengthen our passages without penalty, but were obliged to yield up half our subsidy for the concession. Mr. Smith wisely declines to offer any remarks on Mr. Huddart's scheme from a commercial standpoint. This, he says, ""is a question for capitalists, merchants and shippers, on which Mr. Huddart can enlighten them."" Mr. Smith, no doubt, knows the commercial disadvantages of a costly service and difficult navigation and the consequences attendant on change of terminus in winter, and has probably heard that, since this correspondence opened, one of the great passenger services of Canada has had to go into liquidation and another to change its management. Mr. Henry Fry, Lloyd's agent at Quebec for the last thirty years, formerly the head of the united boards of trade in Canada, and who is recognized as of the highest authority on navigation, published last month an elaborate statement on the character of the St. Lawrence navigation and route, endorsing and elaborating all the views we have given. His letter is too long to quote, but it is at your call. A word in conclusion: Our part in the correspondence has been to justify our abstention from this scheme. We have been obliged to maintain that the speed which is an essential factor, though only one to its commercial success, is incompatible with safety, but we have no desire to cry down the character of the St. Lawrence navigation, while obliged to admit that it is not on a par for safety with that of New York. We have ourselves demonstrated that with due precaution, and steamers being always slowed or stopped when ice, fogs or snowstorms prevail, it is fairly safe, and that the climatic disadvantages of the route can be overcome by the ""subordination of speed to safety."" But we have not stopped at the mere arguing against this scheme. We have presented to the Government strong reasons for their preferring, for the sake of Canada, a system of service that will at once secure the highest rapidity of voyage that the nature of the navigation admits of, combined with other classes of service that will give the greatest facility for the transport of Canadian produce. We have shown that in this lies the true solution of their beneficent purposes, leaving them, so far as we are concerned, free to choose their own instruments for its attainment. We are yours truly, James and Alex, Allan, 25 Rothwell street; Glasgow. A Quotation of Mathematics: The following neat little problem has been going the rounds of the Western papers but, as yet, no answer has appeared. Let us hear from some of our fast-em mathematicians before Friday night: A gentleman two daughters had, And both were very fair; To each he gave a piece of land, One round, the other square. At twenty shillings the acre just, Each place its value said, The shillings that encompassed each, For each exactly paid. ""If 'cross a shilling be just one inch, Ah! It is very near, Which was the better portion, The round one or the square?"" Robbed of Ten Thousand, Lamoma, November 20: The Commercial bank here was entered and the safe blown open early this morning. The robbers secured over $10,000 in money and a quantity of jewellery, diamonds and watches. As Well as Ever After Taking Hood's Sarsaparilla Cured of a Serious Disease: ""I was suffering from what is known as Bright's disease for five years, and for days at a time I have been unable to straighten myself up. I was in bed for three weeks; during that time I had leeches applied and derived no benefit. Seeing Hood's Sarsaparilla advertised in the papers I decided to try a bottle. I found relief before I had finished taking half of a bottle. I got so much help from taking the first bottle that I decided to try another, and since taking the second bottle I feel as well as ever I did in my life."" J. McKAY, Toronto, Ont. Hood's Pills are prompt and efficient, yet easy of action. Sold by all druggists."
"18941227","K. Arnoldi that the members of the carnival committee tender their warmest thanks to His Excellency, Lord Aberdeen, for the kindly interest taken in the carnival, but after the wide circulation given to the event at very considerable expense and the facts that the dates already fixed on have been widely published and that several weeks will yet elapse prior to the inauguration of the carnival, this committee, while holding in the highest respect the memory of their deceased fellow-citizen, the Right Hon. Sir John Thompson, are of the opinion that under the circumstances it would very seriously militate against the carnival to interfere with present arrangements. Major-General Herbert offered the following amendment: That the carnival be postponed for three weeks for reasons that have been set forth. There was a long pause before a seconder could be found for this, but at last Lieut.-Col. Anderson seconded the amendment, which, after some discussion, was put and lost, only the mover and seconder voting for it, and the remainder of the committee, about forty, against it. Hon. Mackenzie Howell, Hon. Mackenzie Bowell returned this evening from Belleville, where he spent Christmas. He is still suffering from a slight cold and a little hoarseness, but is otherwise in excellent health, and laughed good-naturedly when told that some sensation-loving correspondents had been telegraphing away alarming accounts of his being seriously indisposed. Xma Trade, Ottawa merchants generally admit that Xma trade was considerably better than last year and altogether above the average of former years. A little snow would probably have improved it, but it was good enough, anyhow. The Free Press (Liberal), which has for years past been trying to persuade the people of the capital that they were next door to rain, tonight, under the heading No Hard Times in Ottawa, says: In all lines of trade the amount of business among city firms has been exceptionally large, notably among those of large stocks and extensive advertising. Aid. Prefontaine's Notes for Damages- When the question of using rock or Bermudas asphalt was being discussed in the council, Aid. Cluff referred to Aid. Prefontaine having certain contracts in Montreal, and threw out sundry insinuations which Aid. Prefontaine objects to. This morning Messrs. Belcourt & Michie, on behalf, issued a writ against Aid. Cluff for $10,000 damages, charging the representative of the Central ward with slander, and the writ was served about noon today. The Cumberland Election, The writ for Cumberland has been issued. The nomination is on the 15th of January, and the polling, if any, a week later. SIR JOHN'S FUNERAL, Preparations Being Pushed Forward as Thompson Arrives In New York, (From our own correspondent), Ottawa, December 26. As soon as arrangements have been completed with the railway lines over which the special Government train is to be run between here and Halifax a timetable will be issued for the trip. It is expected that instead of leaving Ottawa on Wednesday morning the train will depart for Halifax on Tuesday night. The change has been decided upon in view of the possibility of delay by snowstorms. Halifax, December 20. The work of draping St. Mary's cathedral began today. St. Matthew's church, the Academy of Music, Spring Garden road, the Court house, the cemetery fence on Park street, numerous private buildings along the route of the funeral, and also the business blocks in the central streets of the city will be draped. The funeral car is being built. Dark drapery hangings almost conceal the wheels of the car. Thick tassels dangle at the corners, and the drapery is caught up with silver lace, in the center of the car is a bier and over all, at the height of eight or nine feet, is a large canopy supported on columns and surmounted with plumes and a crown. The arch over the entrance to the Park street gates of the cemetery will be 27 feet high. The principal decorations will be in the Legislative Council chamber. A large number of roses and living plants resembling the Easter lily, and extensive drapings, white and black and purple, are to be employed. No gold is to figure in the arrangements. Silver lace will be used instead. New York, December 28. The White Star line steamer Majestic, which sailed from Liverpool on December 19th, was sighted east of Fire Island at 3:10 o'clock. The Majestic is about 13 hours behind her record. Onboard the Majestic are Miss Thompson, daughter of the late Sir John Thompson, at the time of his death Premier of Canada, and Mrs. and Miss Sanford, wife and daughter of Senator Sanford, who will accompany Miss Thompson to Canada. The body of Sir John Thompson is on board the British cruiser Blenheim, which sailed from Portsmouth, Eng., for Halifax, on Sunday last. The observer at Sandy Hook reports that the Majestic passed in at 5:20 p.m. The wind at that hour was blowing sixty miles an hour, a blinding snowstorm had set in and the sea was running very high. It was impossible to see a line and red yards ahead through the snowstorm, and it is probable the Majestic has anchored inside the Hook, as she had not reached quarantine up to 6:45 p.m. The boarding officer at quarantine says it will be impossible to board the Majestic tonight even should she venture up the channel, as the weather will not permit it. FROM THE QUEEN CITY, filed After Five Months-Vicar General Rooney Dead, (From our own correspondent), Toronto, December 26. Word has been received from England that H. H. Warren, of the Boston Custom house, was today suspended from duty by a special order from Washington pending an investigation of alleged misconduct on his part while on Government business in the British provinces. The seizure and search of the fishing schooner Albert George on October 2 last for alleged smuggling merchandise with which Inspector Warren had considerable to do, figured in the case. BEAUTIFUL COMES DOWN, A snowstorm which visited this city tonight was heavy enough to make possible the first sleighing of the season, and at 8 o'clock the jingle of sleigh bells could be heard in Central Park. Baltimore, December 26. The first snowstorm of the season was extraordinarily heavy. The flakes began to fall early in the afternoon and sleighs were running throughout the city by nightfall. Late at night the wind subsided and the blow fall was succeeded by a heavy rainstorm. Philadelphia, December 20. The first snow of the winter began to fall here this afternoon and in a few minutes a small-sized blizzard had developed. About 7 o'clock the snow changed to a driving sleet storm and at midnight the hail was still coming down as fiercely as when it began. Reports from all sections of the state show that the storm was general and for the first time this winter the country is covered with snow. St. Paul, December 20. The first Arctic wave of winter came down on St. Paul this evening. The range of temperature over the Northwest was from zero at St. Paul to 20 below at Qu'Appelle, Canada. The barometer at the latter point has reached the high level of 31.20. Signal Service Officer Lyons reports that temperatures ranging from 20 to nearly 40 below zero will be registered over the Northwest tomorrow morning. No moderation is expected before Friday. Pittsburgh, December 20. A heavy snowstorm set in at 4 o'clock and at 10:30 there was about six inches of snow and the storm was still raging. Washington, December 20. The first snow of the season fell here today covering the ground to a depth of an inch or more. Cincinnati, December 20. Reports to the Tribune show that a heavy snow is falling throughout southern Ohio and Indiana, all of Kentucky and West Virginia. In the mountain sections of the last two states there is great rejoicing as it will probably cause a big rise in the rivers, thus letting out the immense log rafts that have been accumulating for months. The snow ranges from six to twelve inches in depth and is drifting badly. Chicago, December 20. Snow began falling in this city tonight but abated toward midnight. A high wind prevailed and the thermometer fell to 20 degrees above zero. Reports from Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan say that snowfalls prevail in those states."
"18941228","IANTi'Oni), Ont, December 27 Last evening a very cold northwest wind, accompanied by light snow, set in and continued all night. Today the wind somewhat abated, but the weather still continues cold. Very little snow fell. The thermometer was 7 above at noon. Owen Sound, Ont, December 27 The weather is cold and very stormy here with light falls of snow. The sleighing is now good. The thermometer registered below zero last night. St. Catharines, Ont, December 27 A terrific snowstorm, accompanied by a strong northeast wind, set in here about 10 o'clock last night and is still raging. The streetcar service is demoralized and the trains on the Grand Trunk, Welland, and Niagara Central railways find it very difficult to get through the great drifts on the tracks. The weather is very cold. Limerick, Ont, December 27 A very severe snowstorm is raging here, with wind from the northeast. Judging from the condition of the roads in the city, the side roads in the country will be blocked. Pembroke, Ont, December 27 About two o'clock this morning a very cold and terrific snowstorm set in coming from the northeast. The side roads are filling in very fast. The express going west is about one hour late on account of the storm. The ferryboats have made no trips today. Kingston, Ont, December 27 A wild gale from the northeast last night swept over this section of the country, followed by a heavy fall of snow, which was piled into great banks on the country roads and city streets. At noon the storm showed no signs of abating. The electric car service has been stopped and the cars ""banned"" till the storm ceases. Ottawa, December 27 A snowstorm set in early this morning, and has been steadily growing heavier, accompanied by a strong wind and piercing cold. L'Isle-aux-Coudres, December 27 A severe snowstorm set in this morning early and seems to be increasing. The wind is from the northeast and is blowing a gale. The temperature is zero and the roads are badly drifted. Lindsay, Ont, December 27 Last night the thermometer went down to 10 below zero, with a stiff northeast wind, accompanied by light snow. No serious storm here yet. I'm Kingston, Ont, December 27 The first snowstorm of the season set in at an early hour this morning, accompanied by high winds from the northwest, which caused the snow to drift in some spots, but the storm has not blocked the roads. The temperature is down to zero. In New York State, Auburn, NY, December 27 The first heavy snowstorm of the season began here about ten last night, developing into a blizzard this morning. The average depth of the snowfall is about two feet. No trains have arrived or departed from Watertown up to 11 a.m. New York, December 27 A fierce storm prevailed here last night. Up to midnight about six inches of snow fell. A heavy rain then set in, and this morning the streets were filled with slush. At 11 a.m. light rain was still falling. In Other States, Capo, HI, December 27 The worst snowstorm that has occurred in this section for years raged here for more than twelve hours yesterday, accompanied by a severe northwest gale. Memphis, Tenn, December 27 Three inches of snow fell here yesterday afternoon, the thermometer registering 29. The storm was general throughout the South. Baltimore, December 27 Snow, sleet, and rain alternated throughout the night, filling the streets with slush and impeding traffic. Portland, ME, December 27 A blizzard prevails here. The streets are practically deserted. Hazleton, PA, December 27 The storm raged furiously here this afternoon. Traffic is at a standstill, freight and coal trains having been abandoned and passenger trains running two hours behind time. All collieries have suspended, throwing 20,000 men idle. Telephone and telegraphic service is paralyzed. Shamokin, PA, December 27 At 7 o'clock last night a snowstorm of blizzard proportions began to rage, and has done so continuously through eastern Pennsylvania ever since, almost as badly as the great storm of seven years ago, when this region was blockaded for nearly a week and therefore isolated. Only local passenger trains are running, through trains on the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Jersey Central railroads being completely tied up by immense drifts which fill the mountain cuts. There is an entire blockade of every electric streetcar line, and traffic is at a standstill on all the city thoroughfares. All the schools are closed, pupils and teachers being unable to get to the buildings. There is enforced idleness at the mines throughout the entire region, railroads being unable to put cars into the breaker sidings, and there is every likelihood of a full week's idleness for the miners by reason of the storm. The snow continues, but the wind has abated somewhat, except on the Pocono mountains, where the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western officials report almost a gale, with the long Lehigh cut almost filled high with snow swept in from the highlands. A destructive flood is reported at Carbondale. Cadkin, N.Y., rales and a proper and consistent observance of the terms of the new deed. They naturally agree that the Vigilant came to the Clyde in a quasi-private way, and was welcome in that spirit, but that now we are in the throes of what involves public and international honor, and a trophy which is enviable and stands singularly alone. On the point of granting a receipt for the cup, there is surely some tight-lacing and hair-splitting. Those who know anything on this side in legal matters know that such a proceeding is only a reasonable and proper one in regard to the handing over or transference of any property or chattel of more than ordinary importance. Of course, Lord Dunraven has challenged under the Royal Yacht Squadron, and this body appears to be above granting receipts. Lord Dunraven, however, as representing the British public, does not require to tie himself down to the Royal Yacht Squadron. He is a member of clubs other than it. There was little or no difficulty in the Thistle challenge in 1887, under the Royal Clyde Yacht Club. Why should Lord Dunraven not challenge under that club? It can be called together in a week, and is a more business-like organization in every way than the southern body. Dunraven comes to the Clyde for his designs and to have his boats built, and why should he not patronize the northern center in the matter of having his racing formalities attended to? CHESS, Albin and Showalter, New York, December 27 Showalter won the 24th game of the chess match, in which Albin played a French defense, after 49 moves, late last night. The score now reads: Showalter, 9; Albin, 7; drawn, 8. GOLF, On the Christmas Green On Christmas day quite a number of the members of the Toronto Golf Club enjoyed themselves over the green at Norway Heights. During the morning a cold wind prevailed, but what at one time looked like a threatening snowstorm soon died away. The green was hard and keen, and as a few of the putting greens are slightly on the incline, no little amusement was caused when a putt very cautiously played would wriggle away a dozen feet beyond the hole. After luncheon the following gentlemen engaged in a sweepstake competition, the conditions being one round of the course, or nine holes: Score, H'd'o, Han't, M. Brown, Kate Lester, Marion Abbott, Eleanor Perry, and Estelle Fleur. All the original scenery and effects for both plays will be brought to Montreal next week. Olita Nethersole, Miss Nethersole, the English actress, will make her first appearance on Monday next, December 31, at the Academy of Music. She is certainly one of the greatest artists who has ever appeared in America, writes her advance manager. The peculiarity of her art consists in her entire abandonment of the old methods. She will be a revelation, for no actress so young, beautiful, and original has appeared in this country for the last ten years. In her recent performances in New York, she quite upset all the critics, and while one declared her to be endowed with the divine spark, another, afraid to give himself up entirely to his convictions, proclaimed her a great artist, but contented himself with writing all around that assertion instead of coming directly to the point. By dint of sheer force and artistic accomplishments, Miss Nethersole has brought the press as well as the public to consider her methods novel indeed, and as forceful and natural as the ""new woman"" of the impressionist school will allow. Taken altogether, this actress has caused more discussion than is usually accorded an artist, and the fact remains the same that as a beautiful woman who has youth, culture, and the finest artistic perception, Miss Nethersole stands by herself. She presents her characters artistically dressed. The Royal's Cake Walk Owing to the severe snowstorm which prevailed yesterday, the attendance at the Theatre Royal was not so large as at previous performances of the ""South Before the War."" On this account, the management wisely decided to postpone the open competition for the cake walk until this evening. The prizes are very valuable, consisting of gentlemen's umbrellas, one coconut silver-mounted walking stick, a lady's belt with a gold buckle, a silver-bound morocco purse, and a beautiful gold bracelet with a pretty design, consisting of two hearts, one set with a diamond and the other with a garnet, both being ornamented with a lover's knot. The whole of the prizes were purchased at Mr. Cochenthaler's. As the competition is open to all comers, there is every evidence of keen competition. French Opera House The usual large audience which attends the gala entertainments of the Opera Francais was considerably reduced in numbers last evening, at the initial performance of ""La Fille du Tambour Major,"" yesterday's extraordinary storm having, no doubt, exercised a depressing effect upon the theatre by its obstruction of the roads. It is a pity that such was the case, as the performance was a most enjoyable one, every detail that goes to make up a good ensemble having been carefully attended to, while the acting and singing were spirited throughout. Gilenbach's ""Fille du Tambour Major"" possesses all the elements that combine to constitute a popular opera in the real sense of the word; a very entertaining and clean libretto, bright, tuneful, and catchy music, pretty costumes, intermingled with military uniforms, the effect of which is quite picturesque. The closing scene represents the triumphal entry of the French army into the Italian city of Milan, which has just been captured, and is an elaborate and really remarkable one. The appearance of a regiment preceded by its band on the stage is always the signal for a storm of applause. Mile Degoyon, as the Drum Major's daughter, appeared in one of her best characters, and, as the conscientious artiste she is, did it full justice. Mile Moller made a very pretty cantiniere, M. Vissiere a good Lieutenant Robert, and M. Milo a Duke Della Volta, whose shortsightedness was the cause of much merriment. M. Giraud, the excellent comedian, made the best of the unsuitable part of the Drum Major. ""La Fille du Tambour Major"" will be repeated this and tomorrow evenings, and ""Mile L'Archiduc,"" with Mine Bouitas prima donna, will constitute the bill for tomorrow's matinee. The Theatre Royal For one week, commencing with Monday matinee, December 31, the attraction at the Theatre Royal will be Florence Bindley in her sensational comedy-drama, ""The Captain's Mate."" The play has, say the managers, received the unanimous verdict of press and public as one of the greatest successes of a dramatic lifetime. The plot is one of great interest, which is kept up from first to last. It is full of sensational climaxes, with witty dialogue and comedy running all through it. Incidental to the play, Miss Bindley will introduce her famous specialties, consisting of songs, dances, and musical specialties. The supporting company is a most excellent one and one that was specially engaged for the accurate portrayal of their different parts. The scenic and mechanical effects are most wonderful in construction and the acme of stage realism. The company carries an entire carload of scenery. NEW YEAR'S DAY The Great Festive Season With French Canadians Where to Purchase Goodies What Christmas day is to the Britisher, New Year's Day is to the French-Canadian. It is the day when he throws care to the winds and when worry bothers not his mind; it is the day when he is contented with himself and the world in general; it is the day when he and his family reunite and make merry. But in order to make merry in the true sense of the word, something more is needed than the mere assemblage of the several members of the family, however pleasing in itself such a gathering may be. Something additional is needed to gladden the heart, and that ""something"" can be obtained from Messrs. Dufresne & Mongenais, wholesale and family grocers, and importers of wines, cigars, etc., 221 St. James Street. The windows, which are appropriately decked with greenery, contain ready-made plum puddings, mince meat, prairie hens, quail, wild turkey, the last named at an especially low figure, and many other things that serve to convey to the mind some slight idea of what is to be found within, whilst over the door is a gas device indicating that G. H. Mumm's champagne can be purchased inside. On opening the door, the proverbial feast of good things meets the eye; cases of goods are piled up everywhere, bottles occupy shelves and corners, preserved fruits are prominent, and the several articles needed by materfamilias to make the first day of the new year thoroughly enjoyable are everywhere apparent. There are bon-bonnieres, French, Italian, and German delicacies, and Fry's and Cadbury's chocolates, all of which are more or less prominent on the family table at the season of rejoicing. There are also crystallized and glacial fruits, fruits of all kinds in syrup, fruits in maraschino, fruits in brandy, and fruits a la crème de vichyssoise. Then there are assorted fruits in brandy, some of the vessels containing them having a capacity of four gallons, and very tempting they look. Of pickled fruits, there is any amount of choice. Among the large assortment of French and German vegetables in glass may be mentioned a particularly fine lot of Perry's corn, carrots, asparagus, peas, and beans. In fresh fruits, as well as dried, there are all lines, and of English biscuits, there is a fine display, whilst the aroma of Dufresne & Mongenais' special blend of coffee as it is swiftly ground in the mill by electric power has a decidedly pleasing effect upon the olfactory senses, and goes far towards convincing one of its popularity. And now, turning to what may be regarded as more in the line of after-dinner requisites, liqueurs occupy a prominent place, and all the well-known brands are to be found ad galore: benedictine, curaçao, maraschino, chartreuse, crème de menthe, absinthe Suisse, and the celebrated Parisian novelty, grand marnier. In spirits, there are all the leading brands of brandies, from ""one star"" to the oldest and finest Hennessy; whiskies of all blends, sweet and dry gins, and the rums include St. James, St. George, and the famous Bell's Jamaica. Of wines, there is no lack; ports, sherries, Burgundies, sauternes, clarets, and Rhine wines of all aromas and degrees of dryness being piled up in abundance, whilst those who have a penchant for good old-fashioned beer can take their choice of all Canadian brands. Nor are those other solaces of the human nerves, cigars, cigarettes, and tobaccos, wanting. Towards the rear of the store is a large stock of those goods so dear to the heart of the smoker. There are all brands of Havana cigars; in fact, Messrs. Dufresne & Mongenais receive shipments direct every fortnight, whilst of the celebrated French cigarettes and French novelties, they are the only importers in Canada. This department is under very able management, and in the goods it contains, the firm is doing a fast-increasing business. In passing, a word may be said about the cellar, which is stored with all the liquid refreshments. Try Southern Straight Cut Cigarettes, 10 cts, per package, that the heart of man can well desire. A double row of immense casks runs from Fortification Lane to St. James Street. They contain imported wines and spirits of all blends and brands, and bins along the walls are filled with bottles of like imported goods, whilst carbonated and mineral waters, imported and otherwise, there is truly an abundance. In short, Messrs. Dufresne & Mongenais have laid themselves out for the New Year's trade, and a visit to their store on St. James Street will convince anyone of that fact. ITEMS BY THE WAY, The Blizzard Yesterday's little snowstorm completely demoralized the M. S. R. and put a stop to all kinds of business, but the sale for Hirsch's Perique Mixture goes merrily on, regardless of snowstorms, etc. Headquarters, Hirsch's Havana Cigar Depot, opposite P."
"18941229","If Gray was elected by acclamation on December 1st; Trains on the Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific went north and south of Toronto, were about on time today, but there appears to have been unusually heavy snowstorms north and east. The Montreal express, due here at 7:40 this morning, was about three hours late, and did not pull into the Union station until nearly 11 o'clock. The cars were covered with snow and it was apparent that the train had come through rough weather. From North Bay the train due here about four o'clock this afternoon will in all probability not reach the city until some time tomorrow forenoon, but this delay is said to be caused by the snow between North Bay and Winnipeg. Toronto Bay is frozen over, and if the mercury remains where it is for twenty-four hours longer there will be the finest ice-boating and the most excellent skating on this sheet that has been seen in Toronto for many years. Mayor Kennedy is in the field for a second term against all comers. His Worship said today: ""I have decided to ask for a renewal of the confidence so liberally bestowed a year ago. I do this not of my own motion merely, but in response to the urgent request of numerous influential citizens. There are several unfinished projects I desire to see completed, but I am desirous, above all things, to see a well-established water works system that will place our supply beyond all question and to secure an improvement in the sewerage system of the city."" And I want, too, before I leave the chair, to see the business of the corporation generally placed on a thoroughly sound basis. Rev. Wm. Inglis, assistant librarian in the Parliament buildings, accidentally received an almost fatal shock last evening. He was examining the electric apparatus when he slipped, and in his fall his hand came in contact with an electric contrivance when the current was on. Mr. Inglis was thought for a time to be killed, but he recovered and was taken to his home, and is in a precarious condition. Sir Oliver Mowat entertained Hon.

Tonight Mr. Laurier was the guest at dinner of Mr. THE ROAD COMMITTEE. Complaints of Defective Car Service Aid. Penny refuses to sign warrants. Aid. Brunet presided at the meeting of the Road committee yesterday forenoon. Aid. Turner complained about the defective car service to Point St. Charles on Thursday during the snowstorm.

The main business was the signing of a big batch of warrants. This the chairman refused to do on principle. The Comptroller had informed him that there was no money. Aid. Stevenson held that if they did not sign the warrants the amounts would be deducted from next year's appropriations. Aid. Rainville took the ground that the aldermen did not run any risks by signing the warrants. Aid. Penny added that in the other committees he had only signed warrants for wages. Aid. Costigan expressed his willingness to sign the warrants the chairman did. Aid. Rainville was ready to sign anything. If the treasurer had no money he would not pay. Let the responsibility rest with him. However, the members signed the warrants while Aid. Penny looked on. Four of the City Hall employees sent in a requisition for overcoats, but the chairman could not understand why the city should be looked upon as a charitable institution. The request was laid on the table. Aid. Costigan made a motion that in future no more annual reports be printed. Aid. Penny thought too much was spent on these bound volumes altogether. Why could they not follow the example of the Legislature and issue blue books if necessary? The matter dropped. ""I tell you that I love you."" ""How nice."" ""And I want you to marry me."" ""Pshaw!

Berlin, December 31 The Military Weekly, the recognized organ of the army, has caused a sensation by the bellicose tone of its article reviewing the military events of the year. The writer contends that the longer peace is maintained the more must Germany try to encourage the fighting spirit of the army. The encouragement of this spirit, he thinks, has been too much neglected in recent years. He complains that the science of war has been limited too exclusively to the staff and a few others, but believes that the new regulations, which went into effect last June, will tend to remedy this state of affairs. The authorship of this article is much discussed. The opinion most generally accepted is that the Emperor inspired the criticism and Gen. Bronsart von Schellendorf put them in form for publication.

C. ex-mayor of Montreal, ex-speaker of the legislative assembly, took his place in the House this morning, while addressing the twined upon Mr. Taillon's bill respecting the speaker. Suddenly, feeling the ill effects creeping over him, the honorable gentleman resumed his seat, and as he did so, spoke to Hon. Mr. Harneau and motioned to Hon. Dr. Marcil, who was immediately at his side. He complained of a pain in his left arm and the paralysis spread rapidly throughout the side, the patient growing speedily worse and lapsing into unconsciousness. Meanwhile, the excitement had become general in the chamber. Several members were already at the side of their stricken colleague to render him any assistance that lay in their power, and the proceedings of the House were abruptly suspended. Still unconsciously seated in his chair, Mr. Starnea was carried into the apartments of the Speaker of the House. Dr. Marcil applied cold water to the extremities of the patient, and a priest was hurriedly sent for. In response to the message, Rev. Father Carre, of the Jesuit order, was quickly in attendance and performed the religious offices customary on such occasions. On account of the advanced age of the gentleman, 78 years, Dr. Marcil was unwilling to venture an opinion as to the outcome of his case. However, within an hour or two there were signs of improvement, the symptoms grew less alarming and gradually the patient recovered consciousness and partially the power of speech. Amongst the many friends made by Mr. Starnea in Quebec during his long lifetime, there were many expressions of regret today for his serious illness, and enquiries as to his condition were numerous and frequent. His Honor Lieut.-Governor Chapleau went immediately to the side of his old friend in Hon. Mr. De la Bniere's apartments upon learning of his affliction. Quebec, January 6.

General Paine announced today that he would not put the Jubilee in commission as a cup defender. The America's Cup, New York, January 10. The Evening Sun says: The work of forming a syndicate to build a cup defender is most arduous, no one appears to be anxious to become one of the subscribers of the $1,000,000 necessary to build and equip a yacht that shall be fast enough to lower the colors of Valkyrie III. The Wall Street men are anxious to be left out of the scheme. Hard times are given as the reason. Two years ago four cup defenders were built when the question of a race for the coveted trophy this season was mooted a number of wealthy yachtsmen were said to be anxious to build. It now looks very much as if these men were tired of the great expenditure necessary and the small amount of thanks a winner really receives in return. It has come to be regarded as a matter of course that the American boat will win, and those in pursuit of glory seldom get more than stinted praise for the trouble and expense of building and fitting out a successful cup defender. If any chance should lose the cup the members of it would come in for more adverse criticism than they have gained for. George Gould is thought to head a syndicate. If he does not do this he will bring the Vigilant back to these waters soon enough to engage in the trial races. It may be that this boat will again defend the cup. Colonia may be improved and have a try to win the trial races. The Navahoe is another boat from which yachtsmen expect big things. She will be among the cup defenders, whether Valkyrie II or Britannia, and the cup defenders mentioned above cannot be improved upon, the cup may go back to England. The Herreshoffs will need all their skill and cunning to produce a fleeter boat than the Vigilant. It is said that they can improve upon any of the boats that they have yet built and have the models and plans awaiting the order for a cup defender. After a special meeting of the members of the New York Yacht Club on Monday there will be a meeting of the Cup committee. It will be a formal affair, but a probable syndicate will be discussed if one is not formed in the meantime. ICE TROTTING Trolling at Ottawa, Ottawa, January 10.

Champion George Dixon, who will meet Young Griffo at the Seaside Club January 19, has begun training in this city for the bout. The way that Griffo and his managers are talking, one would suppose that they were sure of winning, but their private opinion is different. The articles that Griffo and Dixon signed in Philadelphia stipulated that the winner should take an even split of the money, but the sports that know the managers of the Australian were satisfied that they would not stand for any such agreement, for they were never known to do so before. Is Griffo's managers have, as expected, made a demand for loser's end, and the officials of the club wired Tom O'Rourke that unless the articles were changed so that the loser would receive $500 Griffo would not meet Dixon. Rather than lose the match O'Rourke agreed to it. Tom O'Rourke has also sent word to Billy Plimmer that he will accept that offer he made in Philadelphia the other day, when he stated that he would meet Dixon at 116 pounds, weigh at six o'clock, for $10,000 a side. If that match is made Dixon will have his hands full for several months, as he is also going to meet Martin Flaherty, providing the latter beats Young Starlight January 21 at the Charlesbank Club in this city. Joe Walcott and Billy Smith probably will meet at the Suffolk Club in this city January 17. The officials of the club met Tom O'Rourke and offered him a good purse for a 15-round bout between Walcott and Smith, and O'Rourke accepted. The manager of Smith probably will do the same.

GLADSTONE MUCH IN DEMAND He is Re-entering Public Life the Next Session IS NOW ON THE RIVIERA, Where He is Astonishing People by Developing an Amazing Amount of Vitality-In Very Good Health, London, January 19 Mr. Gladstone has recently written letters to several of his former colleagues and followers in Parliament informing them that it is his intention to make his re-appearance in the House of Commons and take part in its proceedings. According to these communications, the ex-premier will either vote or speak upon questions of most importance, but will otherwise remain passive. This news has been as gratifying as it has been surprising to the ministerial party. But it is not known what particular measure will call him to his seat in the House. The most reasonable surmise, however, is based upon Mr. Gladstone's answers to letters addressed to him pursuing a general line of enquiry as to what he may be relied upon to do in support of the ministry. While he is disposed to be non-committal as to his intentions, he has intimated that the Irish Land bill, the Armenian atrocities and the anti-Lords measure are the questions in the discussion of which he means to actively take part. If the plans already formulated by the Government are carried out during the session, the proceedings will culminate in the passage of a bill dispossessing the Upper House of the power of veto. Mr. Gladstone's advocacy of this principle will be a tower of strength to the Liberals and their allies, particularly on the eve of a general election, and it will also commit Mr. Gladstone to the resumption of his place in the front rank and cause him to assume the guidance of the party in the direction of turning the elections towards the decisions of the questions affecting this great constitutional reform. New York, January 20 A special cable to the Sun from Cannes, via London, says: It looks as though the present session would be the record one despite the frosts and snowstorms which have compelled invalids to keep indoors for a week at a stretch. But, as in former years, the majority of the visitors are not sick people but pleasure seekers. Before Mr. Gladstone arrived most of the Riviera people were disposed to regard him as an illustrious invalid, broken down by sixty years hard work in the service of the State, but they have changed their views since the Grand Old Man appeared among them. His marvellous energy and comparative robustness astounded them, for they had not been used to see a man of 85 taking long walks and doing big four miles an hour with the best of the youngsters and braving snow, rain and wind. That is what Mr. Gladstone has been doing, and already he looks ten years better for the change. If some of the Tories who are worrying Lord Rosebery into premature age could see His Lordship's predecessor in the Premiership just now, they probably would feel uncomfortable at the evident fitness of the old statesman for work, and would doubtless admit that the rumor of his intended return to active politics is not so wildly improbable as they have been assuming. A full score of royalties are already in the Riviera, and others, including the Emperor and Empress of Austria and the ex-Empress Eugenie, are daily expected.

"18950128","K. Stanley Weir reviewed the facts of the case. All the obligations imposed upon the city by the Legislature in 1800 had all been carried out except St. Antoine street widening and others which at that time had not been contemplated such as the East End station, had been commenced. ""Then you consider St. Antoine street of more importance than the East End station?"" remarked Aid. Smith. ""Yes,"" replied Mr. Weir. ""That's your opinion,"" said the chairman to Aid. Smith. ""I did not express an opinion,"" answered Aid. Smith. Mr. Weir concluded by stating that the city had been ordered by the court to proceed with the first section. Mr. McNamee did not want any witnesses nor ""swearers,"" as he was willing to let the chairman make a settlement as he had done in the case of the East End station. Aid. Smith wanted to know if they considered the prices at the East End station so liberal that they would be willing to accept them. Mr. McNamee replied that it was not for that reason, but that it would be done quickly. The deputation then withdrew, the committee having promised consideration of their case. Aid. Prefontaine then asked that the Road committee be granted $25,000 to provide work for those in need of it; $10,000 would be used at the Outremont quarry, including $3,000 for a new boiler and to put the machinery in first-class order, $5,000 would be devoted to Helorimier Avenue and $5,000 to Cedar Avenue. From the latter place they would get $5,000 worth of stone. Of course, this money would come out of the loan. ""We have not a cent left,"" said the chairman. ""I thought you had $600,000 left,"" said Aid. Prefontaine in wonder. ""And what has become of the $100,000?"" asked Aid. Smith. ""It is all wiped out,"" was the chairman's answer. ""But we can take it out of the reserve, although it is illegal."" The Mayor urged them to do something for the poor, and by doing it now, it would be doing a great deal of good. His Worship, however, did not want them to do anything illegally. In answer to the Mayor, Aid. Prefontaine stated that it was not the intention to break the stone by machinery, but they must use machinery for drilling purposes. The money was then voted unanimously. Aid. Prefontaine, referring to certain insulting remarks made in regard to the fact that the Road committee had refused to give work because the borrowing powers had not been increased, said that it was not true. The Road committee were always ready and willing to give work to the unemployed, and as an instance of this, he said that last year they had spent $10,000 in giving work to the unemployed. Aid. Savignac asked for $10,000 for the Water department to fix up the bridges, etc., along the aqueduct. It was stated that the work could be done cheaper now than in the summer. It was left over until the next meeting. The Mayor asked for a grant of $500 for the Labor bureau. Referred to Aid. Savignac and McBride to look into and report. It was decided to report to council in favor of granting $300 for expenses in the Lavis-Forest enquiry. An account was also received for $300 from the Board of Revisors, who are outside of the City council, was referred to the City Attorney. Mr. Robb having been authorized to purchase a typewriter for his office, the committee then adjourned. Quite recently there were two monster demonstrations of unemployed at the City hall demanding work or bread, with fiery speeches. The speakers insisted that it was the bounden duty of the civic authorities to furnish work. The Mayor assured the men that whatever was in the power of the corporation to do in the line indicated would be done, but the men must be patient. An effort was made to shelve the whole responsibility on the Mayor, because he opposed the city obtaining increased borrowing powers, and to blame him for so many men being unable to get work. But where was the great army of unemployed on Saturday morning? That is a question which Mr. St. George, city surveyor, would like to get answered. There was a heavy snowstorm on that morning, as everybody knows, and there was work for several hundreds of men and horses around the city. The city is divided into twenty-four sections, and each of the foremen report that they experienced a good deal of difficulty in getting men. They even sent out scouts to enlist men, but without success. Up to noon on Saturday there were about 500 men at work and 275 sleighs at work clearing away the snow on the streets where the electric cars run. The officials of the Road department said that they could put double the number at work if they could have got the men. ""The Police Investigating committee has been convened for this evening at eight o'clock."" The City council is to meet this afternoon. A MARCH IN A STORM The Montreal Garrison Artillery Have a Parade Through the City Streets. The storm king was master on Saturday, and the result was that the mid-winter parade of the Montreal Garrison artillery did not take place, as Lieut.-Col. Cole and his officers thought that as the march was to be quite an extended one, outside the city, it would be too great a hardship to order the men out on a day like Saturday. It was after one o'clock when the parade was called off. In spite of the stormy weather about one hundred turned up at the Armory ready for a march out. When they found out that there was to be none, there was much disappointment expressed, and the upshot was that a number of the men asked Sergeant-Major Fellows to request permission from the commanding officer for those present to go out for a tramp. A meeting of the officers was held, when it was decided to have the parade next Saturday to the Athletic Club house, where, on arrival, there will be light refreshments, and perhaps a programme of music, etc., and then the march back to the city about dusk. It was also decided to have a church parade next Sunday to St. Paul's church, where the chaplain of the regiment will preach. This decided on, the boys marched out headed by their new band, under Band-Sergeant C.W. August. Goals Matthews A. Cunningham Point Wells A. Wilton Cover point Peacocks Mullen.

SNOWSHOEING Article Steeplechase The Argyle open steeplechase to Lachine on Saturday afternoon was run through a blinding snowstorm, but the competitors felt none the worse for their long and difficult tramp after arriving at their destination. The start was made as usual from the Oddfellows, Point St. Charles, and sixteen of the runners entered toed the mark at 4 o'clock. Mr. Wm. Hurry acted as starter, and when the word was given they all went off in a bunch, but a few minutes later the three favorites, H. Gowan, W. Gentleman and F. Noseworthy, drew away from the rest and from that out had the race between them. Gentleman broke the way and Gowan stayed in second place till the road at Lachine was reached. Then he put on a spurt and passed Gentleman, who made a final effort to keep the lead. Gowan crossed the tape six seconds ahead of Gentleman, while Noseworthy finished a good third. K. McCullough, the skater, who is going to take part in the Canadian championship races on Saturday afternoon, is in fine condition just now, but he says he will put in all the practice possible before the races. Mr. Rubenstein III The skating fraternity will regret to learn of the sudden illness of Mr. Louis Rubenstein, who has been confined to his room during the past couple of days. Inquirers at the house yesterday were told he had much improved. AT POINT ST. CHARLES Mr. Henanlt, the well-known horseman, and a syndicate have taken charge of the track at Point St. Charles. They are keeping it in first-class shape and are going to give matinees, which, however, will not clash with the arrangements at the Jacques Cartier track. The Driving park is open to the public for speeding purposes free of charge on all except race days. There will be a meeting held during the present week. Races Postponed Owing to the snowstorm, the races which were to have taken place at Jacques Cartier track on Saturday had to be postponed until tomorrow, when a fine day's sport may be counted on. Jacques Cartier Ice Track The weather on Saturday again prevented racing at the Jacques Cartier ice track, and the events which were on the programme had to be postponed till tomorrow (Tuesday), when there will be the unfinished two-mile heats race, left over from last Friday, and a couple of other interesting races. To-day the entries will close for the big meeting to be held February 5, 6, 7 and 8, and it is expected that the list will be much larger than has been received for a winter meeting in Montreal since the Jacques Cartier ice track has come under its present management. The programme arranged for the annual race meeting is a very attractive one, the classes and purses being as follows: 2:50 class, $250; two-mile heats, $200; four-year-olds and under, $100; 2:17 class, $50; 2:27 class, $250; 2:22 class, $1100; special for Montreal horses, $300; five-mile dash, $300; 2:35 class, $250; free for all, $600; consolation, $200. All of these events are open to trotters and pacers, with the exception of the 2:50 class, which is open to trotters only. Jimmie Mac has been barred in the 2:17 and 2:22 classes. The entrance in each race is five percent of purse, with five percent additional from winners, and the various other conditions of the races are much the same as obtain in meetings on the turf. As before stated, entries to the meeting close to-day. It is expected that most of the horses now competing in the races at Ottawa will come to Montreal for next week, and many others are also sure to be here from the United States. Ottawa Driving Club Ottawa, December 20. The Ottawa Winter Driving club's races will wind up tomorrow with the 2:50 class and free-for-all. Rudd Doble is the favorite in the latter, with Sheriff second choice. The other starters are Jimmy Mac, Clara K, Rebus and No Trouble. THE CROKER-DWYER The Croker-Dwyer string of race horses, which arrived at Gravesend on the steamer Mississippi yesterday, were safely landed at Albert dock, London, today. The horses were put on board a railway train this afternoon and started for Newmarket. New Orleans, New Orleans, La, January 25. Clear, cool weather and a good track were the conditions of the weather today. A programme above the average drew a large crowd, larger than usual, and speculation was brisk among the 18 books. First race, 6 furlongs: Martha Griffin, 102 (Rashlin), 1 to 3; Minerva, 106 (Blakel), 4 to 1, 2; Van Bruut, 106 (McCue), 15 to 1, 3. Time, 1:10.

Third race, 1/2 mile: Tramp, 104 (Turner), 4 to 1, 1; Miss Clark, 106 (Roden), 8 to 5, 2; John P., 104 (Mill), 1 to 1, 3. Time, 1:17. Fourth race, 1/2 mile: Henry, 119 (Linman), 8 to 6, 1. January 27. The King's County Liberal-Conservative convention will meet at Hampton on February 14th to select a standard-bearer in succession to the Hon. Mr. Foster, who has intimated his intention of not being a candidate for that constituency at the next Dominion election. Mr. Jointer sends word he will attend the convention. Hon. William J. Pugsley, ex-solicitor-general of New Brunswick, will, it is thought, receive the nomination. He represented King's County for several years in the provincial Legislature and is one of the leaders of the New Brunswick Bar. One of the most severe snowstorms struck the city Saturday noon, almost its first effect being to tie up the street railway till late in the night, when the weather moderated and rain fell rapidly, melting the snow so that today the streets are covered with ice. The new Furness line steamer St. John City arrived early Saturday morning on her maiden voyage from Glasgow. Bishop Newnham, of Moosonee, preached in three of the city churches today. He is visiting the Maritime provinces to raise money for missionary work in his diocese. News was received Saturday that the barque Annie Stafford, 1,207 tons, owned by J."

The Commissioner of Agriculture promised to take the matter into consideration. The Board of Governors of McGill University met yesterday afternoon. The meeting is usually held on Saturday, but on this occasion an adjournment was made to enable the governors to attend the funeral of the son of Dr Harrington. Yesterday a resolution expressive of sympathy was tendered the bereaved father. The other business transacted was purely routine, the question of the vacant principalship not being brought up. The Recent Snow Storm. The effects of the recent snowstorm have been conquered by both the big railroads. The train which had been sent out to relieve the snow-bound Rigaud express got back yesterday morning without having accomplished its effect. It relieved, however, an incipient milk famine which had begun to be made manifest owing to the milk supplies from this district not being forthcoming during the blockade. R llr merit of a Veteran O"
"18950204","FROM THE QUEEN CITY The Decrease In Imports The Mail and Empire (From our own correspondent) Toronto, February 3 The decrease in the imports of this port for January, compared with the same month last year, was due to the fact that through the large fires here the millinery houses were not able to take their goods out of Customs. The Toronto Street Railway shares were weaker today, selling at 75 to 77. The earnings for January were not disappointing. They were $70,431, against $69,245 for the same month last year, which, considering the recent heavy snowstorms here, is considered a good showing. The operating expenses for January have not yet been made up, but will be about 60 percent, against 70.2 for January last year. The approaching amalgamation of the Mail and Empire is a settled fact. Tuesday will see the last issue of the Empire, and Wednesday morning the Mail will contain an editorial stating that the step of November 1887, when the Mail cast aside its allegiance to the Conservative party, has been retracted, and the journal is to henceforth be known as the organ of the Liberal-Conservatives. It is stated the name of the Mail is to be changed to Mail-Empire. It is known Mr. Bunting is opposed to the change, but the proprietors of the Empire will insist upon the retention of the name of the defunct journal. It is said Mr. Bunting will be manager, and only one of the Empire staff, Mr. Colquhoun, an old Montreal journalist, will be given a place on the Mail. It is the intention of Sheriff Mowat next week to interplead to ascertain who is the owner of the household goods on behalf of McKinnon & Co., caused to be seized on a claim against C."

The distance across the mouth of the gulf from Port Arthur, on the east, to Wei-Hai-Wei, on the west, is only 110 miles. Twenty ships can easily close it, and they need not be ships of war. Good swift steamers with a couple of guns on board will probably serve the purpose. To China, the blocking of the gulf would be a very serious matter. Before the day of steamers, Peking needed to procure its supplies of rice and salt by the inland route, secure against interruption by a foreign enemy, but for the last twenty-five years the capital has depended upon communication by sea and the Peiho river, and its plight would be emphatically embarrassing were the Gulf of Pechili blocked. All sorts of contradictory rumors were circulated as to the whereabouts of the Pei Yang squadron. At one time it is said to be at Shan Kai Kwan, and at another it is alleged to have escaped from the Gulf of Pechili and taken refuge in Yangtze river under the guns of the Woo Bung forts, and again it is represented as anchored off the Takti fortifications at the mouth of the Peiho river, but there seems to be no doubt that it is lying in Wei-Hai-Wei. Japanese men-of-war have reconnoitered that formidable fortress at very close quarters and all report the presence of Admiral Ting's ships. Doubtless the Admiral will attempt to effect his escape when the Japanese expedition, now about to embark at Hiroshima, lands on the shores of Shang Tun. It may be that he will even try to strike a blow at the transports, thus varying the painful monotony of his previous inaction. The Japanese hope to be able to intercept him if he seeks to fly from Wei-Hai-Wei, and to force him to stand to his guns once more. But the possibility of accomplishing that is doubtful. It is not easy to imprison ships in a harbor protected by fortresses mounting guns dangerous to any enemy at five miles' range, especially when, as is the case at Wei-Hai-Wei, the entrance of the port is masked by an island. It will be most interesting to observe the maneuvering of the Japanese to entrap their enemy. They have to work in midwinter among the snows and fogs of a proverbially tempestuous sea. Until the Pei-Yang squadron is wiped out of fighting existence, China will feel completely at the mercy of the foe. New Year's Day in Japan is a time of universal celebration. Everybody visits everybody. Over the entrance of each house decorations are hung, and no one outside the circle of veritable pauperism fails to send gifts to friends and acquaintances. At the Imperial court, especially, the season is observed with much pomp and splendor. This year, however, the Emperor announced his intention of dispensing with all the usual ceremonials and rejoicings. The thought of the soldiers spending their New Year among the snows of Manchuria chilled all sense of pleasure in the palace. Hiroshima followed the sovereign's example. No visits were paid; no presents were sent; no pine boughs were suspended over the lintels. Probably no abstention of the kind had ever before occurred in the history of the town. The Emperor recalled his soldiers' sufferings in another way also. He put on a private's uniform and spent several hours in the evening performing a species of sentinel work in the open air. Then he told his ministers and nobles that he understood something of what the soldiers had to endure, and that it should be the earnest duty of every official in Japan to neglect nothing that might alleviate the army's pains. A Tobacco Famine, something like a tobacco famine prevails in Port Arthur, Talien and Antung. The cheapest grade of Japanese leaf purchasable in Tokio for 10 sen (five gold cents) a pound sells in these places at 25 times that price. Coolies of the land transport corps recently arrived from Japan are able to sell whatever tobacco they have brought them at two sen per pipe, which is something like a sen a whiff, the Japanese pipe being a most miniature affair. Manchurian tobacco does not ease the situation. It is too coarse and unpalatable. The Japanese soldiers prefer to smoke dried willow leaves. The Japanese have found an immense stock of coal at Port Arthur, enough, it is said, to supply the wants of the army and navy for six months. The greater part of the coal is Japanese, from which fact it appears that the coal must have been transported at Shanghai before the war commenced, since the export of Japanese coal to Chinese ports was prohibited after the declaration of war. An additional proof of China's belligerent preparations prior to the outbreak of hostilities is thus furnished. It is stated that fully two thousand fugitive Chinese soldiers are concealed in the hills and other out of the way places in the vicinity of Port Arthur. These men have arms. They live by marauding, but as they never appear in bands of any size it is extremely difficult to hunt them down. Placards have been posted intimating that if they surrender peaceably their lives will be spared. A few have taken advantage of the offer, but the majority prefer to lead the existence of bandits. The severe cold of midwinter will probably drive them out of their lairs before long. The Tong Haks rebels, in the southwesterly province of Corea, are now said to number a million. Out of 53 prefectures in the province, 50 have been compelled by the insurgents to become partisans of the insurrection. The Tong Haks have erected Chollado into a separate kingdom, appointing their own sovereign and administrative officials. Were these people fighting for freedom they would deserve sympathy, but having submitted quietly to the yoke for decades, their armed opposition to a power undertaking their relief of that yoke is inconsistent with any genuine love of liberty. They are merely political tools, agitating in the interests of the Ming family, whose members find that the reforms introduced by Japan cut at the root of their extortion and corruption. The latest intelligence from the disturbed districts says that the people themselves have killed the Tong Hak leader, that his head has been identified by the Japanese sent to quell the insurrections, and that the rebels have dispersed. From Port Arthur, Talien and Chinchow comes news that the Chinese civilian inhabitants have become perfectly reconciled to the situation, and are carrying on their usual avocations in peace and content. In fact, they are said to have already discovered that Japanese rule, with its freedom from all extortion and its complete guarantees of life and property, is far preferable to Chinese. The Diet resumed its sittings in Tokio on the 8th of January, after the New Year's recess. It is plain that all political parties in the Diet are agreed as to the expediency of avoiding any semblance of dissension at the present crisis. The Diet's session will pass quietly and uneventfully, for the first time in the history of the Japanese parliamentary institution. Reforms in Corea. At the instance of Count Inoy, the Japanese representative in Seoul, the King of Corea had made a solemn oath before the tombs of his ancestors, to observe fourteen pledges. His Majesty promises to abandon all reliance upon China and hold firmly by the independence of his kingdom; to enact a law of royal succession, clearly distinguishing between the sovereign head and its branches; to superintend state affairs in person with the advice of his cabinet, the Queen, any of her relatives or any court lady being rigidly excluded from participation in such business; to draw a distinct line of demarcation between the court and the administration; to define the duties and competence of the cabinet, of the departments of state; to limit taxation strictly to the imposts prescribed by law, and to rigorously interdict any extra levies; to codify the laws; to retrench and introduce order into the national and court expenditures; to introduce the system of military conscription, and to abolish all distinctions of class in appointing and promoting public officials. It needed all the tact and firmness of the Japanese representative to bring about the taking of this oath. If the King keeps it, brighter days are in store for the people of Corea. Japan's foreign commerce during 1891 aggregated million yen in round numbers. Never before did it reach 200 millions. The figure for 1891 was 178,010,000. Divided into exports and imports, the figures were: Exports, 131 million yen in 1894, against 81 in 1893; imports, 117 millions in 1894, against 83 in 1893. Thus the total increase in the value of trade was 53 million yen, in which great expansion exports figure for millions and imports for millions. It must be remembered, however, that the appreciation of gold is responsible for a part of the increase in the silver value of imports. Coming chiefly from gold-using countries, their prices when converted into silver undergo an increase proportionate to the silver price of gold, but there is no doubt on the other hand that the appreciation of gold acted as a bonus upon exports, and helped considerably to encourage that branch of trade. It is certainly worthy of note that, despite the war, Japan's foreign commerce shows such an excellent record for the year thus closed. Waltham will soon have a formidable rival in Japan. There has been established in Osaka a watch manufacturing establishment. It is supplied with splendid machinery from the United States, machinery originally designed to furnish a new American factory, but not applied to that purpose owing to complications not publicly explained. The idea of making watches in Japan did not originate with the Japanese themselves, but they adopted the suggestions eagerly and a company was soon formed with a capital stock of 310,000 yen. Permanent buildings for the factory are now in process of erection on a large scale and pending their completion the machinery has been set up temporarily elsewhere. It is now in full working order under the superintendence of Mr. Wheeler, an American citizen. Watches of the best workmanship will be ready for sale in a few weeks and, of course, the remarkable cheapness of skilled labor in Japan will constitute an immense advantage in competition. America's sales of watches and clocks in Japan do not aggregate more than 150,000 yen annually, so that the loss to United States manufacturers will not be large so far as Japan herself is concerned. But there is no apparent reason why Japan watches and clocks should not by and by monopolize all the markets in the east. The programme of the Japanese operations in Shing King has now been rounded off by a northward movement of a brigade of the second army from the Liao Yung peninsula. It has already been explained that without such a movement the left wing of the first army could not play the offensive role appropriated to an invader. In the closing days of December Major-General Nogi marched from Chin Chow, near Talien, at the head of a brigade of the second army, and on January 10th he reached Kai Ping, an important town 115 miles distant. Kai Ping had been originally garrisoned by some 30,000 troops under General Sung, but 14,000 were withdrawn for the operation ending the battle of Kang Wasai (December 18) and the remainder, with the exception of about 4,000, seem to have gradually retreated from the place, joining the remnants of Sung's defeated force at a place westward of New Chwang. Thus Nogi encountered no serious resistance. On January 10 Kai Ping was in his possession. At present the situation in Manchuria is briefly thus: The first Japanese army holds the main part of the Chinese forces imprisoned in the mountains northward of Feng Wan and the whole of southern Ubin King, the coast road to China proper, is guarded by an isolated force of between 20,000 and 25,000 men. The Japanese are keeping up their victorious march towards Peking. London, February 4, A despatch to the Central News says the Chinese general, Kung, is encamped outside of New Chwang, with 50,000 men. General Hung reports having lost 500 men in trying to recapture Kai-Chow. The Japanese are within ten miles of New Chwang. It is expected they will take the foreign settlement there, and then march to Pan-Hat-Kuan. Mobs of rowdies infest the settlement and have raided the houses of several native merchants, plundering the houses and wounding many of the inmates. London, February 4, A despatch to the Central News from Tokio says: Admiral Ito reports that in consequence of the severe snowstorms and heavy gales which have prevailed since January 31 the Japanese fleet has been obliged to take shelter at Yung Cheng, leaving only a small squadron to watch operations at Wei-Hai-Wei. The cold is intense, the guns of the warships being covered with ice. English, French, German and American warships are watching the fighting at Wei-Hai-Wei. The transport Yokohama left Yung-Cheng for Port Arthur on the morning of February 3rd. She reports that the Japanese fleet had returned from Yung-Cheng and were off (Continued on Eighth Page) THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT The Contents of the Queen's Speech to be Read Today, A DECORATIVE PROGRAMME The Oriental War, the French Treaty, Russian Boundary Line, Naval Appropriation Among the Subjects, London, February 4, The Queen's speech on the occasion of the opening of Parliament tomorrow was read at the Ministerial banquet tonight. The document refers to the continued efforts to promote peace between China and Japan, the conclusion of the treaty with France in regard to the African hinterland, and the prospect of an early settlement of the question of the Russian boundary line in Central Asia. The speech also expresses regret at the Armenian outrages and asks for an increase of the financial provision for strengthening the navy. No reference is made to the question of the veto power of the House of Lords. The Irish Land bill is placed before the Welsh Church Disestablishment bill. The Daily Graphic will say: The sessional programme will be purely decorative. The small loss and fickleness of the majority will not enable the Government to carry useful legislation. The Morning Post asks: What has become of home rule? The Daily News will say tomorrow: The Queen's speech will not contain any surprise. The Ministers' intentions have been clearly and frequently stated and have received popular approval. The Irish Land bill will not, as some believe, attempt to reconstruct the agrarian system of Ireland, but merely to amend existing acts."

"18950207","W. Kefs, Minister of Education, at the banquet of the Ontario Press Association in Toronto on January 31st: In replying to the toast of Canada, so ably proposed by that veteran journalist, the editor of The Advertiser, I am somewhat overwhelmed by the many lines of thought which it opens before my mind. The very name Canada suggests a history reaching back three hundred years to the explorations of adventurers from across the Atlantic, who threaded their devious way up our lakes and rivers or through our primeval forests in search of El Dorados, always expected but never found. It suggests the settlement of the early pioneer who, fearless of danger and privation, planted the institutions of his native land in our virgin soil. It suggests bitter struggles with the forces of nature and still more terrible conflicts for the possession of the territory which is called by its name. It forgets enterprising journalists with stick in hand setting up their fervid editorials, and then with perspiring brows working off mammoth weeklies on a Washington Hoe press at the rate of 500 copies per hour. It suggests a great heritage of immense extent and resources, set apart by a bountiful Providence to be the home of a free and progressive people. It suggests, but why pursue this thought? The toast is Canada, our own land, beautiful for situation, as the psalmist said of Jerusalem, the joy of the whole earth, the birthplace of many of us, the object of the most affectionate regard of all its citizens, journalists included. Let us walk about this Canada you have so kindly received, and take its measurements that we may realize, if possible, more accurately its extent. Territorially, it is nearly equal in extent to the continent of Europe, and contains over one-third of the area of the British Empire, or 4,010,783 square miles more than the area of the United States leaving out Alaska. We could find room within its borders for England, Ireland and Scotland (and usually it is advisable to give Irishmen and Scotchmen plenty of room), France and Germany, Portugal and Spain, Scandinavia and Denmark, Belgium, Holland, Italy and Turkey, and still leave many thousand acres to farm out to Czar Nicholas III and his Siberian exiles. Were its lands divided per capita among its inhabitants, every man, woman and child would be the proud possessor in fee simple of about 400 acres of real estate with the right to convey the same, subject to succession duties, of course, to his or her heirs, administrators, executors and assigns forever. Ontario alone is almost equal to France or Germany in geographical extent, and about one and a half times as large as Great Britain and Ireland. Or comparing ourselves with other provinces, Ontario is ten times as large as Nova Scotia, about eight times as large as New Brunswick, and one hundred times as large as Prince Edward Island. Or comparing ourselves with our neighbors to the south, Ontario is larger by 40,000 square miles than the North Atlantic states, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania. Even our inland lakes are greater than many of the kingdoms over which European monarchs rule, and when we consider the majestic sweep of such rivers as the St. Lawrence on our southern boundaries, with its connections, 2,314 miles long; or the Saskatchewan that ploughs our prairies midway a distance of 1,712 miles; or the Mackenzie, dropping into the Arctic Ocean after flowing a distance of 2,400 miles through Canadian territory, a slight idea may be formed of the vastness of our Dominion. We have mountains grander than the Alps or Apennines, mountains that can look down from their serene heights upon the eternal snows of Mont Blanc. Were all the classic mountains of Greece Olympus, Ossa and Pelion piled one upon another, they would be as pigmies in the presence of the smallest of the Sierras that buttress our western boundary. We have forests which the avaricious eye of the lumberman has not yet seen, and which no reporter has yet described; and we have mineral resources, the value of which no assayist has yet been able to determine. Our agricultural wealth is only limited by the demands of humanity for the staff of life, and our harvests of the deep, as McGee called them, by the courage and industry of our fishermen. So generous has our great patroness, Nature, been that there is little or nothing which the human heart could desire that she has not bestowed upon us. It remains for us to show that we are worthy of her bounty. And here one might reasonably ask, Has this vast estate of forest, field and flood passed to our hands simply that a geographer, in preparing a map of North America, might have a name for every part of it, or does the possession of it call for any act on our part to make our title indefeasible? To exercise dominion over a great territory might be a very laudable ambition, an ambition by which, at one time or another, almost every nation of the world was moved. The Roman Empire, long before Julius Caesar subdued Gaul, sought to enlarge its borders, and it is said Alexander the Great wept because his conquests were limited to the little world in which he lived. In more modern times, Spain, France, Germany, Great Britain and Russia delighted in conquest; and even our American neighbors, if the Monroe Doctrine still prevails, are not devoid of the desire to extend their boundary northward as far at least as the aurora borealis and westward as far as the Hawaiian Islands. POPULATION WANTED. So far as territorial extent is concerned, our ambition should be satisfied. Even the addition of Newfoundland need have no special attraction for us. To occupy the lands we possess would be more to the purpose. How to increase the population of the country is the greatest problem which confronts us. Let us see how we stand in this respect. The average population of the Dominion is but 14 persons to a square mile. Ontario, with all its wealth and progress, has but 10 persons to a square mile, while the United States has 21, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland 312, France 187, Germany 237, and Belgium 485. The average of the British Empire and all her colonies is 63. If we attained the density of population now possessed by the United States, or even the lower average of Ontario of 10 persons to the square mile (and there is no reason why that should not be attained in the next century), the Dominion would contain over 30,000,000 people. At the opening of this century, the population of the United States was only 3,800,000; now it is 65,000,000. What the nineteenth century did for the United States we fondly hope the twentieth century may do for Canada. But whatever may be our regret with respect to the tardy settlement of the country, when we come to consider what we have accomplished towards its commercial development we cannot charge ourselves with want of enterprise. We have expended for the improvement of inland navigation and the construction of canals the sum of $61,151,330, thus making ocean-going vessels reach the very heart of the continent a distance of 2,384 miles from the seaboard. We have a merchant marine consisting of 7,010 vessels, with a tonnage of 1,051,211 tons. This gives us the fifth place commercially among the nations of the world, Great Britain, the United States, Sweden and Norway, and the German Empire being in advance of us, while France, Italy, Russia and Spain are our inferiors. We have invested $872,150,470 in the construction of 15,320 miles of railway, or more, according to our population, than the United States or the wealthiest nation of Europe. Our cities are all supplied with abundant facilities for rapid transit, and by means of our postal and telegraph system the remotest part of the Dominion has easy and quick communication with the great commercial centers. We drill annually for the defense of the country 45,000 of the bravest of our sons. We have established several military schools for the better education of our people in the art of war, and we have erected 10,480 churches as a counterpoise in which, upon every Lord's day, is proclaimed the gospel of peace. We have built 10,154 public schools, 14 universities, 41 colleges and over 300 high schools, and expend annually about $12,000,000 to prepare 1,000,000 boys and girls for future citizenship. We endeavor to inform ourselves as to the world's doings by 75 daily newspapers, 8 triweeklies, 14 semi-weeklies, 587 weeklies, 17 semi-monthly magazines, 147 monthlies, and 4 quarterlies, in all 852 visitors of varied politics and modes of thought. We sharpen our intellects upon 3,000,000 volumes from our public libraries, and we import annually for literary purposes $1,218,500 worth of books and stationery. We may discount our promissory notes (when we can find an endorser) in 300 different banks, having a paid-up capital of $60,000,340. How much of that capital belongs to the journalist is not for me to say. This brief summary of the efforts made for the development of the country, commercially and educationally, is unmistakable testimony of Canadian energy. What if we have not yet subdued all our waste land and peopled every acre of our illimitable prairies? What if we have not delved into every hillside for the mineral treasures which it contains? Who but the veriest pessimist in the face of these facts would despair as to the future? Even had we the golden touch of Midas, what more could we have done? By the strong hand of the hardy pioneer, great forests have been turned into wheat fields and gardens. By the enterprise of the capitalist, steamships and railways carry our produce to the ends of the earth. Where the Indian shaped his arrowhead in a rude wigwam sixty years ago, cities compactly built together with teeming thousands are now to be found. The refining influences of religion, education and journalism pervade every home, and the sweet privilege of sitting under his own vine and fig tree, none daring to make him afraid, is within the reach of every citizen. NO DOUBT ABOUT THE FUTURE. But, it may be said, although Canada possesses half a continent of her own, though she has the most ample facilities for the transportation of her commerce by land and by water, though she has banking capital fully adequate for all business purposes, though she has latent resources which the necessities of centuries to come are not likely to exhaust, yet her future is a matter of the greatest doubt and uncertainty. I repudiate this timorous suggestion. (Cheers.) I, for one, have no fear as to the future of Canada, and I shall tell you why. Canadians represent a generous admixture of the most progressive and energetic races on the globe. For instance, about 30 per cent, or 1,400,000 of our population, are of French origin, whose frugality, industry and morality have been accredited by the experience of over three centuries; 60 per cent, or about 2,800,000, are of good old British stock, of whom about 1,100,000 are of Irish descent, 650,000 of English descent, 710,000 of Scotch descent, and 100,000 Welsh. We have, in addition, 300,000, or about 7 per cent, of a German population. The remaining 3 per cent, for my argument, need not be considered. But you will say, this variety of race is our weakness; if we are to succeed we must be homogeneous. I answer not so. I read history. (Applause.) Where among all the nations of Europe will you find a greater variety of racial types than you will find in Great Britain? So great that very few of us can tell whether the Saxon, the Norman, the Danish or the Celtic strain predominates in his own case. And yet who will dare question the virility of the British race or their right to the sovereignty of the world? On this continent, too, the most powerful nation is also the most varied racially, but, in spite of it all, the dominant force of the American Republic is the good old British stock, begotten of Puritanism and Anglo-Saxon independence—the same stock that fought the battles of the Revolution and laid the foundations of the Republic a little more than a century ago. I like the Saxon word breed, which means to grow, to develop, upon a good stock, trained through generations in the habits of self-government, hardened, it may be, by centuries of struggle for existence, conscious of its ability to grapple with and overcome difficulties, self-reliant enough to assert its rights, and courageous enough to defend them if assailed, and you need no other guarantee as to the future of a nation. That is our position in Canada, and no nation can be a failure where its ruling forces are composed of such stalwart elements. The racial forces which govern Canada govern the whole world. They control its commerce, compose its armies and its navies, legislate for its millions in popular assemblies of varied kinds, and there is none to question their behests or challenge their supremacy. And are we to suppose that, having demonstrated their power by centuries of achievement, having founded and colonized the empires, they would drop from their nerveless grasp the sceptre of conquest when they touch our shores, and content themselves with a future of idleness and obscurity? Nay, verily. (Cheers.) Then what have we to fear? I have confidence in the future of Canada because our constitution is so elastic as to permit the fullest expression of the popular will. It is a happy combination of the diffusion of power and central control. As an instance of diffusion, we have in Ontario alone about 6,000 limited monarchies in the form of school boards; we have 900 limited monarchies in the form of municipal corporations; we have 45 limited monarchies in the form of county councils; we have 7 limited monarchies in the form of provincial governments; we have 1 limited monarchy, which we fondly call the Dominion of Canada; and overall presides Her Majesty, the embodiment of the best limited monarchy which the world ever possessed. This constitution, with its multiplex adaptations, is our own creation. On the one hand, it represents the idea of local control to the very verge of socialism; on the other hand, that concentration of power essential to the solidarity of national interests. For 27 years we have tested its adaptability to our various political necessities, and no one can say that it has failed to serve the purpose for which it was designed. In some instances it may have been misunderstood and misinterpreted; in other instances it may have been strained to serve a purpose which it was not intended to serve; but in no case can it be said as the instrument of oppression, except with the consent of those for whom it is administered. And if today every Canadian, whether on the platform or through the press or at the ballot-box, has perfect freedom of opinion, if no one can touch his pocket by taxation or his person by indictment, except with his consent, if the will of the majority for the time being is the obligation of all, it is because the constitution we have framed by our own hands secures for us these priceless privileges. As a Canadian, I want that constitution, modified as the growing wants of the country may require, to be for us an abiding hope, a sure and steadfast anchor. I know of no privilege compatible with public morality which it does not permit me to enjoy, I know of no aspiration for the future of the country which it compels me to restrain, and I want my children and my children's children to cherish it as they would cherish the precious memories of their childhood and the hallowed associations of their home. (Cheers.) Using the words of Udelis, the gifted writer of Canadian verse, let us hope that In the long hereafter this Canada shall be The worthy heir of British power and British liberty; Spreading the blessings of her sway to her remotest bounds, While with the honor of her name a continent resounds. True to her high traditions, to Britain's ancient glory Of hero and of martyr, alive in deathless story; Strong in their liberty and truth, to shed from shore to shore A light among the nations till nations are no more. Mr. Boss resumed his seat amid tumultuous applause. THE COLD SNAP. Heme Extreme Temperature Recorded.

The cold which is now being experienced throughout the kingdom is the most severe that has been felt for years. The thermometer in the Midlands averages 6 degrees below zero. The docks at Southampton are partly frozen over, and protracted snowstorms and gales have prevailed all over the United Kingdom. Strong gales are reported from Queenstown, and a heavy sea has been running since Friday. Many vessels are taking shelter at Queenstown and other ports. The Scotch and Welsh railroads are blocked with snow. In the Scotch Highlands, snow has fallen almost incessantly since last night. The roads are blocked and railway travel is impossible. A train is embedded in an enormous drift near Loch Rannoch, Perthshire, and all efforts to start it have been futile as the snow is piled up by the high winds as fast as it is shovelled away. All travel by land or water has stopped north of Inverness on Moray Firth. Barns and sheds have been isolated by the drifts. Many cattle are dying under cover. Thousands of sheep and deer have perished from cold and hunger or from suffocation in the drifts. Small game has suffered more than before in ten years. The blizzard is driving the grouse seaward in great numbers. In Westmoreland, several schools have been surrounded with drifts, and parents of the school children have gone to dig them out. Many deaths of aged and infant poor are reported from the Midland counties. The gale has wrecked several fishing boats off the Fife and Berwick coasts and six or seven men were drowned. Toronto Item.

"18950209","Y Central and Hudson River railroad was completely blockaded today as a result of the storm. This afternoon it was reported at the Grand Central depot that 28 trains were caught in the snowstorm and stalled. Trains were caught between Hudson and Poughkeepsie and between Poughkeepsie and Peekskill. The Empire State Express started for Buffalo this morning, but only got as far as Peekskill by 1 o'clock this afternoon. Engines' snowploughs were sent out over the road to clear the track and through train service was resumed with the departure of the North Shore Limited at 4:20 this afternoon and every effort will be made to get the train through to Chicago without delay. Local trains on the Hudson River division are running regularly and it is expected that tomorrow all through trains on this line will be running as usual. Hell Gate became impassable with ice this afternoon. There is no open water in the vicinity of City Island. As far as can be seen from there the Sound is a solid mass of ice. Reports from all points on Staten and Long Islands say the storm is the worst ever experienced. The marine observer at Fire Island reports that the schooner J.B. Manning is ashore 8 miles east of there. The crew has been saved by the life-saving crew and brought ashore. Another schooner is ashore 5 miles east of Fire Island. A line has been thrown over her, but the crew is supposed to have been frozen. Some anxiety was expressed early in the day for the steamers Pilgrim and City of Brockton of the Fall River line, but this afternoon the former was reported at Newport and the latter at Fall River. Both experienced very heavy weather but made the trip without accident. Pii, AiiEi, rniA, February 8.

He has kindly consented to speak on Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, in the Church of St. John the Evangelist's Parish hall, Ontario Street, on Tuesday evening next at eight o'clock. The Dean is a devoted Shakespearean scholar and that he will treat the subject in an interesting manner goes without saying. The Opening Postponed. The president and directors of the United Counties Railway Company had issued invitations to a large number of friends to attend the formal opening of the road today, leaving the Bonaventure depot at nine o'clock and returning to the city by seven. In consequence of the severe storm, however, the inauguration has been postponed until a future date. Ancient Order of Foresters. There was a good attendance at Court Unity last night. After business, a program was gone through very creditably. Pro. Whcble, of Court Reliance, contributed to the evening's enjoyment by singing several songs. Bros. Silverwood, Scruton, Davidson, Green and McDowell, of Court Unity, also took part. It is intended to visit Court Reliance on Tuesday next. Found No I In Time. An old man was found asleep in a pile of snow at the corner of Craig and Gosford Streets last evening. He was half frozen and was taken to the Central Police Station where he was cared for. His hands were bare and it was all he could do to hold the snow shovel he had been using. He had a cloth cap on and a short jacket but no overcoat. Jiralli of 91m, Drury. The death occurred last evening, at 41 St. Alexander Street, of Mrs. Owen Drury. The deceased lady was a sister of Messrs.

IN OLEHKt' PROVINCE. The storm was fully as severe as it was in Ontario. QiiiLC, February 8. (Special) The storm today was one of the worst of the season, the wind having attained a velocity of 60 miles an hour, and huge snow drifts are piled up on the streets. Tonight, after the east wind went down somewhat, it veered about and commenced storming from the west. There were specially high tides tonight and the effect of the strong east winds has blown up the water of the river to such an extent that the lower parts of the city were all inundated. In St. Roch's the water was two or three feet deep on Prince Edward Street and cellars as far back from the St. Charles as Deslosses Street were flooded, in Lower Town, D'AhouNie Street and the stores about Finley Market were flooded and considerable damage was done in the flour store. It is expected that in many cases the loss will be heavy. All the trains today were late, the C.R. were unable to cross the river on account of the storm. The wind was too high and started so many chimney fires that the firemen were called out nearly twenty times today. No damage was caused in any case. Hudson, Que, February 8.

HE ABMAKGES FOR A LOAN In Case Congress does Not Act England Will Take Part of the Bond--A Heavy Interest Rate. Washington, February 8. The President sent the following message to Congress at noon today: To the Congress of the United States. Since my recent communication to the Congress, calling attention to our financial condition and suggesting legislation which I deemed essential to our national welfare and credit, the anxiety and apprehension then existing in business circles have continued. As a precaution, therefore, against the failure of timely legislative aid through congressional action, cautious preparations have been pending to employ the best possible advantage, in default of better means, such executive authority as may, without additional legislation, be exercised for the purpose of reinforcing and maintaining in our Treasury an adequate and safe gold reserve. In the judgment of those equally charged with this responsibility, the business situation is so critical and the legislative situation is so unpromising with the omission thus far on the part of the Congress to beneficially enlarge the powers of the Secretary of the Treasury in the premises as to enjoin immediate executive action with the facilities now at hand. Therefore, in pursuance of section 3,700 of the Revised Statutes, the details of an arrangement have this day been concluded with parties abundantly able to fulfill their undertaking, whereby bonds of the United States, authorized under the act of July 18, 1875, payable in coin, 30 years after their date, with interest at the rate of 4 percent per annum, to the amount of sixty millions and four hundred thousand dollars are to be issued for the purchase of gold coin amounting to a sum slightly in excess of sixty-five millions of dollars, to be delivered to the Treasury of the United States, which, added to the gold now held in our reserve, will so restore such reserve as to make it amount to something more than one hundred million dollars. Such a premium is to be allowed to the Government upon the bonds as to fix the rate of interest upon the amount of gold realized at 3 percent per annum. At least one-half of the gold to be obtained is to be supplied from abroad, which is a very important and favorable feature of the transaction. Hold Bonds Pay Best. The privilege is especially reserved to the Government to substitute at par within ten days from this date, in lieu of the four percent coin bonds, other bonds in terms payable in gold and bearing only three percent interest if the same in the meantime should be authorized by Congress. The arrangement thus completed, which, after careful inquiry appears in present circumstances, and considering all the objects desired, to be the best attainable, develops such a difference in the investors' opinions between bonds made payable in coin, and those specifically made payable in gold in favor of the latter, as is represented by three-fourths of a cent in annual interest. In the agreement just concluded, the annual saving in interest to the Government; of 3 percent gold bonds, should be substituted for 4 percent coin bonds under the privilege reserved, would be $531,150 amounting in 30 years, or at the maturity of the coin bonds, to $10,174,770. Of course there never should be a doubt in any quarter as to the redemption in gold of the bonds of the Government which are made payable in coin. Therefore, the discrimination in judgment of investors between our bond obligations payable in coin, and those specifically made payable in gold is very significant. It is hardly necessary to suggest that whatever may be our views on the subject, the sentiments of preferences of those with whom we must negotiate in disposing of our bonds for gold, are not subject to our dictation. I have only to add that in my opinion, the transaction herein detailed for the information of the Congress, promises better results than the efforts previously made in the direction of effectively adding to our gold reserve through the sale of bonds, and I believe it will tend, as far as such action can under the circumstances, to meet the determination expressed in the law repealing the silver purchasing clause of the act of July 14, 1890, and that in the language of such repealing act, the arrangement made will aid our efforts to ""insure the maintenance of the parity in value of the coins of the two metals and the equal power of every dollar at all times in the markets and in the payment of debts."" GROVER CLEVELAND, Executive Mansion, February 8, 1895. In the House the messages from the President announcing the sale of bonds and the protest by this Government against the execution of the court martial sentences on citizens of the United States, who engaged in the recent revolt in Hawaii, were received and referred, the former to the committee on Ways and Means, the latter to the committee of Foreign Affairs. The Senate referred the financial message to the Finance committee. Turn of the New Issue. Unless Congress, in ten days, passes a law authorizing the issue of gold bonds bearing 3 percent interest and running thirty years, or otherwise relieves the Treasury in the replenishment of the gold reserve, Secretary Carlisle will, by direction of the President, sell 4 percent bonds to the amount of $62,400,000 for gold. Arrangements whereby this can be done, and $105,000,000 in gold be received for the bonds, have been perfected, and the contingent contract was signed today. An official memorandum of the transaction was made public at the Treasury this afternoon. It is as follows: The contract was made with August Belmont & Co., of New York, on behalf of Messrs."

NEWS OF LA GASCOGNE The Big French Steamship Now Over a Week Overdue. MANY STEAMSHIPS ARRIVE but all Report Not Seeing Her-The City of Wakefield's Perilous Experience. New York, February 10. Three Atlantic liners arrived at this port this morning, but none of them brought any news of the overdue steamer La Gascogne, which should have reached here a week ago. The first to arrive was the Manitoba, from London, which passed Sandy Hook at 2:05 a.m. She is properly a freight steamer, but on this trip brought a few passengers. She cleared from London on January 26th, and had moderate weather until February 4th, when she encountered a hurricane off Sable Island. From that time until this morning she experienced rough weather and extreme cold. The Rhynland, which left Antwerp January 29th, with nine cabin and 110 steerage passengers, arrived at the bar at 7 o'clock this morning. She also encountered the hurricane off Sable Island on February 4th, and on the 5th and 6th was obliged to heave to for 24 hours. After the arrival of the Teutonic on Friday night with no news of La Gascogne, the hopes of those interested in the French liner were transferred to the Rhynland, and they experienced another disappointment when the latter reported here with no tidings of the belated vessel. The Rhynland was a mass of ice formed by freezing spray. Hopes an inch thick were at least ten inches in diameter and it was almost impossible to see forward from the bridge. The steamer was so weighted down with the ice that she was listed to starboard at an angle of nearly 45 degrees. The Manitoba had almost exactly the same experience as the Rhynland, but did not suffer so much from the ice. She is a very large vessel and the spray did not reach her decks. The only vessel sighted by the Manitoba was the Rhynland, which she passed two days ago. The next to arrive was the Cunarder, Umbria, from Liverpool, February 2nd, and Queenstown February 3rd, passing Sandy Hook at 10:50 a.m. She had strong northeasterly winds to February 7, at midnight when the wind shifted to northwest and struck her with hurricane force off Sable Island. She was compelled to heave to for 30 hours, and drifted out miles to the eastward. She also came without any news of La Gascogne. The Umbria brought 80 saloon, 80 second cabin and 130 steerage passengers. Brought the Elbe survivors. Among her passengers were John Vevera, Eugene Schlegel and Charles Hodman, survivors of the Elbe disaster. When interviewed at quarantine, Mr. Vevera said: ""At the time of the collision I was dozing in the smoking room, as my cabin was too cold for comfort. With me was Mr. Wix, of New York. It was a very sudden shock and none of us had the least warning of trouble. I rushed out on deck and made an attempt to find my niece, who was below in charge of the stewardess. I found I could not get down to the second cabin, and I made my way to the promenade deck on the port side. I heard orders being shouted, and the passengers were being massed on the starboard side. I saw some sailors trying to clear away a boat on the port side, and I approached them. The ship was hove down on the port side, so that the lower deck was almost level with the water's edge. I do not think that the boat's falls were frozen, as has been stated; certainly I saw no ice. After some little difficulty, owing to the boat's grips being stuck with paint, she was lowered and we got into her. The woman was picked up as we left the side; she had evidently jumped from the upper deck. The boat was not a large one, and the twenty people in her made her too deep in the water that it was impossible to get any more passengers in her without sinking her. From the time of the collision to the sinking was only about 20 minutes. Mr. Hodman said that he proposed to spend his earnings of twelve years if necessary to prosecute the company for murder. Again he said that he had not told all, but if the company did not do the right thing he would tell everything. He insists that First Engineer Noussel took his boy out of the boat and then slipped in himself, and he also reiterates that he pulled Miss Becker into the boat against the protest of the steamer's men. In refutation of this statement Mr. Winter, passenger agent of the North German Lloyds company, today exhibited a cable just received from the home office of the company as follows: ""Hoffman's declaration that Noussel was taken in the boat instead of his son is untrue. Four persons went into the boat after Noussel and then Miss Becker was taken in."" Mr. Vevera and Mr. Hoffmann received letters at Quarantine from their friends congratulating them on their safety. Mr. Hoffmann was much affected. The Umbria has brought in the crew of the French barque John Baptiste, consisting of 14 men, whom she picked up last Tuesday. The barque, which ran between Halifax and Cork, was sinking and the men were in a pitiable condition. The steamer Dania, from Hamburg and Havre, was sighted south of Fire Island at 7 o'clock this evening. She comes over practically the same course as the overdue steamer La Gascogne would follow. Up to a late hour tonight the Dania had not been reported at Sandy Hook lightship. At 12:55 this morning the marine observer at Sandy Hook reported another steamer coming in and anchoring near the one supposed to be the Dania. He thought she looked like a French liner and endeavored for half an hour to get signals from her. At 1:43 a.m. he reported that she was still anchored outside the bar. He said she was probably La Normandie, which is due to arrive. The United Press tug has gone down the bay to interview the steamers off Sandy Hook. The Patria Aground. The marine observer at Sandy Hook reported on Saturday morning that the steamer Patria, of the Hamburg-American Steamship company, which passed out this evening, en route to Hamburg, and later anchored opposite Sandy Hook, was either aground or disabled near Palestine shoal. She displayed lights, ""vessel not under control."" Palestine shoal is right opposite the Sandy Hook observer's tower, between the main ship channel and the Swash channel at the pitch of the Hook. The Patria made desperate efforts to tack off the shoal, but did not succeed and had to remain on the shoal until the flood tide this morning, when she got off and proceeded to sea, signaling that she was not damaged.

The Teutonic's Booth Trip Brings Comfort to Anxious Ones, Paris, February 10. The story told by the Teutonic's captain has given some comfort to many persons who are watching anxiously for news from La Gascogne. If the Teutonic's speed was 20 knots an hour, they say, La Gascogne's could not be more than 10 knots. The captain of La Bourgogne, which sailed from Havre yesterday, was instructed to keep a sharp lookout for the vessel and to shape his course toward Newfoundland, with a view to getting some trace of her. The Paris and London assure their readers that there is no reason for alarm, as many vessels have come safely into port after being longer overdue. Captain Servan, one of the best officers in the service of the French line, takes a hopeful view of La Gascogne's delay. He speaks most highly of Captain Burdelon, whom he regards as one of the most competent navigators afloat. The director of the French line's Paris office, who is an ex-captain, attributes the delay to a break in La Gascogne's machinery. He says she probably will toss about until sighted and taken in tow. He thinks there is no danger of her foundering, and she has provisions enough for three months. London, February 10. Despatches from Havre contradict the recent assertion of the Manhattan's Paris correspondent that Lieut. Deloncle commands the missing steamship La Gascogne. Captain Landclon is in charge of the vessel. LONDON, February 10. The Daily News will say tomorrow in a leader concerning the missing steamship La Gascogne: ""There is reason for the anxiety for the La Gascogne, but not for the alarm. If there has been an accident to her machinery she may need all the time already lost to make port under sail. The fact that none of the vessels arriving at New York sighted her probably is due to the prevalence of fogs and blinding snowstorms. It is most likely that she is struggling against storm after storm, each retarding her, but none sufficiently powerful to overpower so stout a ship."" DO NOT BE ALARMED, Vessels Arriving on the Other Side do not Report Her. SOUTHAMPTON, February 9. The steamer Queenstown, from New York, which arrived here this morning, reports that she saw nothing of the La Gascogne during her voyage. London, February 9. The steamer Luminia, from New York February 2, which arrived at Queenstown this morning, saw nothing of the La Gascogne, but last evening, 200 miles west of Fastnet, she supplied a Norwegian barque with provisions. Glasgow, February 10. The Anchor line steamer Anchoria, Capt. Young, which left New York on January 26th, and was due here last Tuesday, came up the Clyde this morning. She is damaged. Her captain reports that she experienced strong northwest gales the first two days of her voyage and a northeast hurricane afterwards. With the hurricane came blinding snow and sleet. On the 4th and 5th she stopped and put out her anchor and sixty fathoms of chain to hold her head to the wind. A HALIFAX RUMOR is that La Gascogne had been wrecked on Sable Island. Halifax, N.S., February 10. A good deal of speculation has been indulged in here today over a report that the steamer La Gascogne was ashore on Sable Island. No one can tell how, when or where the rumor started. It certainly is not official. The only communication with Sable Island at this time of the year is by carrier pigeon, and none have arrived at the loft here, and the superintendent states none would be let go in such weather as has prevailed for the last week. It is reported here that the cable steamer Mackay-Bennett, which sailed today, has gone looking for La Gascogne, but this is doubtful. La Gascogne should have been, at least, 100 miles south of Sable Island, and if she is near there it could only be by having become disabled and drifting or by having been carried there by wind and wave while bearing up for Nova Scotia for coal. The probabilities are, however, that the whole story originated by somebody suggesting that La Gascogne had gone out to Sable Island.

Mr. Barlow was standing on the down track from the West superintending some repairs when the express from Toronto came in. He did not perceive the advance of the locomotive, and in a moment it was upon him. A shriek of horror went up from the men who saw their foreman in danger but could not prevent it. It was thought that his life had been crushed out between the wheels, but happily the engine in striking Mr. Barlow threw him clear of the track. When picked up he was found to be unconscious. His forehead had been cut open, displaying the skull, and his back badly injured. Medical assistance was at once summoned and seven stitches put in to close the gash. Later Mr. Barlow recovered sufficiently to walk around but it is feared that serious results may follow. Sunday School Convention The 58th annual gathering of the Sunday School Union of the Province of Quebec will be held on the 21st and 22nd of February, Thursday and Friday of this week, in the large new school room of the Douglas church, 2781 St. Catherine street. The convention will commence at 2 p.m. Thursday, and sessions will continue morning, afternoon and evening until Friday night. The special speakers from the States will be the Rev. J. Cooper Robinson, from Japan, and the Very Rev. Dean Carmichael. It was an illustrated lecture, and the scenes, as depicted by Rev. Mr. Robinson, were very realistic, and they were duly appreciated. The Outremont Guardian The Outremont Guardian is the title of the latest star in the journalistic firmament. It is devoted to the affairs and interests of the suburban municipality whose name it bears, and gives considerable space to the discussion of the Park & Island railway, and the proceedings of the municipal council. The Guardian is a creditably printed sheet, but the publishers have been too modest to give their names. Diocesan Woman's Auxiliary The annual service of the Diocesan Woman's Auxiliary will be held in Christ Church cathedral today at 11 a.m., and will consist of celebration of the Holy Communion with an address by the Lord Bishop of the diocese. All are invited. There will be interesting meetings of the auxiliary on the same day in the Synod hall at 2:30 and 8 p.m., and on the following day at 10:30 a.m., 2:30 and 5 p.m. The Railroad Snow Account A small army of men assembled at the Bonaventure station yesterday afternoon to draw their pay as snow shovellers during the recent heavy weather. There were fully two hundred waiting the cashier, and as not one of them earned less than $1.50 a day, some idea may be gathered of what a real good snowstorm costs a railway. A St. Patrick's Day Orator Hon. James McShane, president of the St. Patrick's society, waited yesterday morning upon the Hon. Wilfrid Laurier at the Hall, and invited him to deliver an address on St. Patrick's day at their concert in the evening, at the Monument National hall. The honorable gentleman at once consented and was delighted to meet his Irish friends in Montreal on that occasion.

"18950223","CONVENTIONS YESTERDAY Mr. E. Baron Is Nominated in Sherbrooke Sherbrooke Storm Knocked Out Several Conventions In Ontario Toronto, February 22 In his address at Peterborough yesterday, Mr. Dalton McCarthy, speaking of the school issue said: All the recent decisions of the Privy Council meant was that the Government had power to consider the question and to grant a remedial order. The courts had not decided, and had no power to decide, whether the Government ought to do so or not. If the Government interfered with the school system of Manitoba they were as responsible for that act as for every other act to Parliament and to the people. The Government said the question was not a political one, and that it should be decided according to law. If it were once admitted that a Cabinet council composed of partisans could sit as a court and give decisions according to their interpretation of law it would away with the system of responsible government under which we have the happiness to live. If the Cabinet acting as the advisers of the Governor-General-in-council constituted a court of law, their decision was a matter of their conscience, and they could not be censured for it. Mr. Laurier, on the other hand, said the question was one of fact, of difficult fact, as to whether the schools were Protestant or merely public schools. He had taken a long time to discover which they were, and it might be well for him to look up the decision of 1892, in which the courts held that the schools were in reality public and not Protestant schools. To the leaders of both parties he desired to say that they could not sink the politician in the judge. All the facts were known, and the law was known. What the Government must determine, on its responsibility as a Government, was whether it should advise the Governor-General to pass an order-in-council re-establishing the system of separate schools abolished in Manitoba after nineteen years' experience. If the order went Manitoba was not bound to obey it, and he ventured to say without a great prophetic flight that Manitoba would not obey it. (Loud applause) The Government would pass this remedial order, and backed by the whole strength of the church in Quebec would appeal to the people. Was that the game? (Applause) Had the Government been brought to book on the promise of 1911 to grant remedial legislation? That apparently was the programme, and the two great parties were in agreement on the issue. He asked the electors of Peterborough, remembering that the matter would again come back to Ottawa and that a new Parliament would be asked to pass a separate school law for Manitoba in default of action by Manitoba, to send to the House men who would leave to Manitoba the right to deal with her own educational affairs. For the people of Ontario to say that, while they did not want separate schools here, they proposed to force them on Manitoba, was to prostitute their rights as free men and do a gross wrong to that little province.

The net earnings are not yet made up. It is expected they will show an increase for last month of $6,500. This would be a decrease in operating expenses of $5,200 compared with the same time last year, which would be a good showing in face of the fact that last month we had the heaviest snowstorm experienced in Toronto in years. The stock sold today at 74 1/2 to 75 1/2. New York, March 1 By one of those transformations of feeling which lend to Wall Street most of its pictures, the terror over the high exchange rates vanished overnight, and today's stock market expressed relief accordingly. At the top price the syndicate bankers drew exchange today in sufficient quantity to meet all the needs of regular remitters. Very possibly the current demand for bills has been increased by efforts to cover some of the exchange gold short by other bankers two or three weeks ago. The probability is that many of these operators made a costly experiment, for they misjudged completely the programme of the syndicate. Even now Wall Street's mind is not wholly clear as to the nature of the situation. The sales of syndicate sterling bills, for the purpose of stopping possible gold exports, belong solely to the indefinite fifth clause of the bond contract, pledging the bankers to make all legitimate efforts to guard the Treasury reserve. It can hardly be correct, in the light of the contract's other specifications, to describe the current sales of bills as drafts against the bonds sold for the Government abroad. Payment for those must, by the contract's terms, be made in gold imported at regular intervals from Europe. Not even the deposit in the Government banks of gold bought in New York would fulfill the contract for the one-half of the issue placed in Europe. The sales of sterling can never increase nor diminish the amount of gold necessarily deliverable to the Treasury from the London market. This means merely that all the current operations to control exchange are conducted by the syndicate's individual capital and at its individual expense. This is one of the services in return for which the Government fixed the low syndicate price for its four per cents. The stock market began the day with a sharp and prompt recovery. Changes, however, were exceedingly irregular, most of the market being plainly governed by buying in of shorts. Naturally enough, this upward reaction was especially forcible in Northwestern, Louisville & Nashville, New Jersey Central, and one or two industrial stocks. In some other quarters, pressure to sell, though not so energetic as that of yesterday, continued so that there were some further declines. But during most of the day the market's apathy was complete, the only incident most noteworthy being the publication of the Jersey Central annual report. Nothing need be added to the comment, which has been made already in this column, of the company's situation and policy. The statement conforms in all respects to the forecast made when the February dividend was declared at the full seven percent. The company's president explains that the unearned dividend was paid because the trade situation is regarded as temporary. Meantime the company's balance tells the history of its action, that $1,000,000 cash was borrowed on 5 percent bonds with ninety-two years to run, nearly half of the proceeds being used to maintain the company's maximum rate of dividend.

"18950402","S, April 1 The steamer Alfred Kcan, of and from Rockland, Me, bound to New York, with lime, was lost on Trinity ledge, off Port Maitland yesterday morning. The vessel encountered the heavy snowstorm last Thursday, during which she lost her deck-load and had her fore staysail and headgear carried away. When the wind changed they ran before it, and about nine o'clock yesterday morning brought up on Trinity ledge, the buoy, which was gone, having been carried away in the recent storm. The mate, Chas. Davis, was washed overboard when they were trying to get into the boat and drowned. The rest of the crew got only what clothing they had on and landed on High Head cove. The master, Reuben L. Folkingham, and his four men are being cared for by United States Consul O'Connor, and will be sent home on Wednesday night. Davis, the mate, who was lost, belonged to Rockland, where he leaves a widow and one child.

For Children? Is worthy every parent's study; not only what they can eat, but what gives the most nourishment. No children are better, and most are worse, for eating lard-cooked food.

It was on the strength of assertions that the Canadian rates were higher than those maintained on its southern rivals that the commission was appointed. These assertions were made and maintained with a vigor that convinced many in the East that the West was being harshly dealt with, and in a manner to do the West a maximum of harm with possible settlers, and a minimum of good in the way of securing a remedy. Other Canadians are only beginning to understand how much windage must be allowed for in connection with Winnipeg's wailing. Commenting on the trade situation the Toronto Globe says that recently quite a few retail merchants have taken thirty-day discounts rather than give paper for longer dates. Such a state of affairs is decidedly a good indication. It speaks well for the retail trade in the sections where it is noted, and it means, on the year's overturn, a very considerable reduction in the cost of goods sold, thus increasing the cash dealers' ability to undersell the credit store, and advancing the time when the much talked of evil of the credit system may be reduced to a minimum. It is a sign, too, that could not accompany a generally depressed condition of commerce. The Protestant committee's resolve that the course of Bible study shall be taken directly from the Bible itself is on a good line. There have been many interesting and instructive Bible histories written, and some valuable Bible history textbooks produced. None, however, as a means of inculcating the principles of the Christian faith and the duties of the Christian citizen equal the narratives that bear the Evangelists' names or the letters of the Apostles to the first churches; and none in the exalted simplicity and forcefulness of their English approach the standard set by the translators of the old King James version of the Scriptures. Another post office clerk has been sentenced for stealing letters. The temptation to this crime must be peculiarly strong among the morally weak members of the service, when they so often succumb to it. There is no crime which if persisted in, is so sure to be fixed on the perpetrator. As soon almost as it becomes known to the departmental officials that letters are going astray they have a clue to the locality of the criminal, and all that can save him from detection is to cease his evil doing. If he persists the race with the constable is short and the end sure. The British Columbia Methodist conference has declined to pass a resolution on the Manitoba school question, holding that it would be unwise thus to interfere in politics. There may be much Christian wisdom in this course, though those who resolved on it will miss much newspaper advertising of their views. There is not known to be on record any case of a dinner being brought to repentance by a church's denunciation of a government. There is an idea in Berlin that Russia's interference between Japan and China was not that power's last card on the Pacific. Less shrewd people than the Dutchmen have this idea also. If it does not turn out that Russia prevented Japan from holding the Liao-Tung peninsula in order that she might the easier get hold of it herself, past precedents in connection with Russia's Asiatic policy will go for naught. The defeating of a church warden for personation, bribery and illegal voting practiced in his behalf at the annual election of such officers will cause a good many to pause and ask where we have arrived at.

NESSMORE IS ASHORE Wrecked on an Island on Southwest Coast of Scotland. FOURTEEN FEET OF WATER In her Hold-Many Marine Disasters Reported Yesterday Notes of River, Lake and Ocean, London, November 21, The British steamer Nessmore, from Montreal, November 5, and Quebec, November 8, for Liverpool, has gone ashore on the Island of Coll, one of the western islands of Scotland. Her crew are safe. The Nessmore has 14 feet of water in her hold. The wrecking steamer Ranger, with pumps and other appliances, has been sent to her relief. The Nessmore will land as many as possible of the cattle which she has on board, pending the arrival of assistance. The steamship Nessmore was formerly commanded by Captain Richardson, but, at the time of the mishap, Captain Hawket was in command. She was built in 1882, at Barrow, for Messrs. Win, Johnston & Co., her present owners. She is 210 feet long, has a beam of 40 feet 4 inches and is 21 feet 1 inch in depth. As will be seen by the following manifest, her cargo is both a large and a valuable one: Mtl'ie & Co, 8,800 bush peas; O M Harris & Co, 25 tons phosphate; Watson & Todd, 32,055 pes deals, etc; Grand Trunk Railway, 4,000 sax oatmeal, 300 do flour, 1,000 bills staves, 2,700 brls apples, 2 crates cast material, 325 bbls apples, 1,250 bxs cheese, 11 crates eggs, 387 cs do, 750 bxs cheese, 140 bbls apples, 200 cs eggs; Canadian Pacific Railway, 50 boxed organs; Kirkpatrick & Cookson, 571 bxs cheese, 2 bbls apples; P W McLagan, 2,400 boxes cheese; J C & G B Warrington, 1,571 do do; Hodgson Bros, 2,408 do do; W Dobell & Co, 40 bbls ashes, 8 do apples; Win Meldrum & Co, 200 cs eggs; J W Windsor, 200 cs cd apples; Cooperative Kcty, 4,587 boxes cheese; Duckott, 1 ledge Co, 782 do do; W T Ware & Co, 1,807 do do; McBride, Harris & Co, 280 bbls apples; A W Grant, 1,200 boxes cheese; John Crowe, 212 bales cut hay; A J linen, 262 boxes cheese; Thos.

Carey, which will be the last boat to have the port this season, arrived in port yesterday morning after a stormy passage. She sailed from Liverpool on November 7, and for the first few days, fine weather was enjoyed, which was followed by a succession of northwest to westerly gales. On arrival at Belle Isle a heavy snowstorm set in, which forced Capt. Carey to come to an anchor for 7 hours. Quebec was reached at 9:00 on Wednesday morning last, and after the passengers had disembarked and western cargo had been discharged, left for Montreal. Owing to a heavy snowstorm at Grondines, the Lake Huron, together with the steamships Lake Ontario and Cape Breton came to an anchor for the night. The Allan line steamships Norwegian and Iona were also compelled to anchor at Sorel for the night. Despite the stormy passage of the Lake Huron, the passengers expressed themselves as being highly pleased with their treatment on board. The Lake Huron was no sooner berthed than Wharf Superintendent Herwick placed large gangs of men working at her cargo. It is expected that she will leave the port tomorrow on her return trip, with a large cargo and a full number of live stock. Among the latter will be upwards of 200 horses.

GERMAN CABLES, The Kaiser Goes Shooting and Raises High Jinks Generally, Berlin, November 24. The final spell of enjoyment by the Kaiser before his attention will be engaged in the din of political and court affairs by the resumption of the session of the Reichstag, and the opening of the winter season will be passed up on the royal estates in Prussian Saxony, where the Emperor will go on Monday. His Majesty has recently had a period of remarkably successful hunting at Picsdorf and Letzlingen. The shooting lodge at Litzlingen was the scene of nightly festivities, and the Emperor joined in the fun. In the banquet room, there is a quaint drinking cup, fitted into a stag's horn. This cup, which has been used since the time of King Frederick William III, requires half a bottle of wine to fill it. The drinking horn fits into the antlers, which are so carved as to keep the mouth from coming into close contact with the rim of the cup. The custom is that a guest attending the hunt for the first time must empty the cup at a single draught. Upon the occasion of last week's hunt, Chancellor Prince Von Hohenlohe was attending as a neophyte, and the Kaiser asked him to drink the health of the Empress out of the cup, which was filled with champagne. Prince Hohenlohe essayed to do so, but poured the wine over his face and inside of his collar, amid the laughter of the Emperor and the assembled guests. Besides conducting the Funicula, played by the military band, at the hunting banquet at Letzlingen, as described in last week's dispatches, the Kaiser took the baton while the band played five military marches and a composition of Count Philip Von Eulenberg. The guests agree that the Emperor conducts with both vigor and precision. Ex-Empress Frederick will arrive in Berlin November 28th, and remain until the end of January. Literary and art circles will hail her advent with pleasure, and the charitable institutions, as she is a generous contributor to many works of charity. Count Herbert Bismarck has lately been stumping Prussian Saxony in the interests of the Agrarians. In one of his speeches he defended the grain bill drafted by Krimitz, and in another speech he came out in favor of bimetallism, protective tariffs, and the introduction of an eight-hour day upon imperial docks and wharves, to go into effect April 1, 1890. At present, the employees work ten hours. An eight-hour day, he argued, running from 7 o'clock in the morning till three o'clock in the afternoon, with a quarter of an hour for breakfast and the same length of time for dinner, closing the works at three o'clock, would give the men time for daylight recreation. He strongly urged a trial of this system, which, if it should prove to be detrimental to the work after a trial of six months duration, could be abandoned and the existing system returned. Prince Henry of Prussia traveled a distance of eighteen miles, from Darmstadt to Humpenheim, on Thursday, to congratulate his mother, ex-Empress Frederick, on her birthday. Ex-Chancellor Caprivi is visiting Berlin. He maintains the strictest privacy and receives no visitors. Heavy snowstorms are prevailing in the vicinity of Lemberg. The railways are all blocked and traffic is almost wholly suspended. A syndicate of Berlin and Frankfurt capitalists has concluded arrangements for the conversion of the Russian railway loans, amounting to 106,000,000 marks. This agreement implies the placing of large orders in Germany for supplies of railway material. It is the first great Russo-German financial operation that has been entered into since 1881, and proves, conclusively, the renewal of friendly relations between Germany and Russia."

In the Chamber of Deputies to-day, Signor Sonnino, Minister of the Treasury, announced that a balanced budget would be obtained. He stated that the Government intended to limit expenses to necessities and to persevere in its programme, excluding the creation of new debt. The present depression of the market, he added, had affected the international situation but would have no effect upon the budget, the Italian Treasury not needing to enter into any financial operations. Signor Sonnino's statement made a generally good impression. Calais, France, November 25. The suspension of Channel traffic, owing to the fierce gales which have prevailed since Saturday, led to animated scenes on the railway platforms and steamer piers here. Hundreds of persons have been waiting here for two days for an opportunity to cross the Channel, and the Terminus Hotel has been crowded, large numbers of guests being obliged to sleep on the floor of the buffet, while anxious crowds swarmed on the end of the pier, seeking signs of a coming boat. The steamer officials promise that a boat will arrive from Dover tonight. St. Petersburg, November 25.

My little boy had a breaking out on his face. It was eczema and became one solid sore. I gave him Hood's Sarsaparilla and cured him, and he has not had even a pimple on his face or body since. My husband was a sufferer from dyspepsia. Physicians' prescriptions gave him but little relief. Since taking Hood's Sarsaparilla for several months he can eat heartily and never felt better in his life. Hood's Sarsaparilla has also benefited my husband's father, who, now past eighty years of age, has had rheumatism for 40 years and also stomach trouble. He has also taken several bottles of Hood's Sarsaparilla and been cured."

A brick block on Notre Dame Street East, just past the new iron bridge, opposite the Dalhousie Square Station, suffered considerably from the gale. The roof was ripped up in some places, and the cornice displaced, and blown into the streets. On Dufferin Street, a two-story stable belonging to Messrs. Joseph Brothers, was blown to the ground, with a result that the high wind carried several bales of hay across the road, impeding vehicular traffic for a considerable time. The big snowstorm of December last will be vividly remembered; vehicular and other traffic was suspended, the electric cars locked, and for several hours business was practically at a standstill. The electric lights were out last evening, from Mountain to Inspector streets, on St. Antoine Street, and, but for the few gas lamps burning, the street would have been in utter darkness.

TO PUT ON needed flesh, no matter how you've lost it, take Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. It works wonders. By restoring the natural action of the deranged organs, it builds the flesh up to a healthy standard promptly, pleasantly, and naturally. The weak, emaciated, thin, pale, and bust are made strong, plump, round, and rosy. Nothing so effective as a strength restorer and flesh maker is known to medical science; it puts on healthy flesh, not the fat of cod liver oil and its filthy compounds. It rouses every organ of the body to activity, purifies, enriches, and vitalizes the blood so that the body feels refreshed and strengthened. If you are too thin, too weak, too nervous, it may be that your assimilation is at fault. A certain amount of bile is necessary for the reception of the fat foods in the blood. Too often the liver holds back this element which would help digestion. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery stimulates, tones up, and invigorates the liver, nourishes the blood, and the muscles, stomach, and nerves get the rich blood they require. Spent Hundreds of Dollars with no Benefit. Col. Kmas of the Strength St., Roxbury, Mass., writes: ""After suffering from dyspepsia and constipation with us for at least six months, I am more than pleased to say that after using Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and 'Pleasant Pellets' for one month, I was entirely cured, and from that day to this I do not know, thank God, what even a livid headache is. I paid a doctor on Tremont St., Boston, in one day the sum of $15 for treatment, and received no benefit. I felt more relief in one hour from your medicines, and for my stomach was comforted, than from all the other medicines I tried.

"18960103","THE ANCIENT CAPITAL Interesting Items Gathered In the Carnival City (From our own correspondent) Quebec, January 2 Six seminary students, on their way home to the Island of Orleans on New Year's Eve, had a narrow escape from drowning. It appears that they started from here at 9 o'clock in the evening in a sloop in charge of Pilot Boulfard and two men. It was just about this time that a snowstorm started up, and shortly after they left Quebec it was almost impossible to see for any distance ahead of them. For twelve hours it became a struggle for life or death with all on board. The storm raged, and the snow and sleet froze to the rigging, and for a while it looked as though all would be drowned. Pilot Boulfard displayed great courage in keeping up the spirits of all on board. In the morning they made for the nearest point of land in view, which turned out to be St. Joachim, below St. Anne, where word was telegraphed to this city and the Island of their safe arrival. During the night their whereabouts caused no end of excitement, and the wires between all points in the vicinity of the river, below Quebec, were kept going. Yesterday morning they reached the Island, considerably exhausted from their night's experience. A batteau was seen floating down the river this afternoon, caught in the ice. There seemed to be people on board. The ice flees are very heavy today. The Merchants Bank has taken a capias against James Gibson. The amount of the debt is H6. It will be remembered that an account was published of the arrival at Levis of a number of immigrants, brought out by the Scotsman, suffering more or less seriously from frost bites, and who were cared for in the Hotel Dieu of Levis. This morning, in pursuance of instructions received from the Government, Mr. Doyle, Immigrant agent here, opened an inquiry into the cause of their sad condition on arriving in this country."

"18960203","BISHOPS PROTEST Want Br Cleveland to do Something for the Armenians New York, February 2 This numerously signed and earnestly worded memorial was mailed to Mr Cleveland today: To the President of the United States of America We, Bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, beg most earnestly and respectfully to address you, the Chief Magistrate of the nation, in relation to the massacre of our fellow Christians in Armenia. The extent of these massacres is not fully known, but enough is known to reveal the horror of the situation and to call for the indignant protest of all civilized and Christian people. It is claimed by those well acquainted with the facts that no less than 350,000 of our fellow Christians are now suffering and are in danger of perishing in consequence of the massacres in Asiatic Turkey, and that at least 50,000 have been already murdered. In Trebizond and Erzeroum, in the Provinces of Bitlis, Van and Harsut, and in the whole district of Sivas, the people are given over to indescribable misery and outrage. Villages are sacked, property is destroyed, and men, women and children are tortured and put to death for holding to the faith and practice of the Christian religion. The entire severance of Church and State in our country should not be allowed to stifle our sympathies or hamper our action in a case like this; it should rather stimulate them. It is a case which especially appeals to us as men and Americans. As citizens of this Republic, we have learned to know and are bound to maintain that no form of religious belief should expose its adherents to persecution. It is as representatives and maintainers of this essential American principle that we appeal for national action in this matter of a foreign persecution, whose details are too horrible to depict or enumerate. We sincerely trust that some measure or measures consistent with the national traditions and the national dignity may be devised, and that speedily, which shall bring the whole force of the national sentiment to bear upon the solution of this subject; to cause the instant suppression of the massacres, to succor the unhappy and impoverished survivors of them, and to secure for the future ample guarantees for the safety of a Christian people in the exercise and maintenance of their faith. We feel profoundly that our nation will cease to recognize the Turkish Government as a civilized power so long as its barbarous treatment of the Armenians continues, and that it should bring every influence to bear upon the civilized nations of Europe which may cause them to present a united front in demanding that such atrocities cease at once and forever.

It is now probable that Brazil will permit Great Britain to establish a big coaling station on the island for her South Atlantic squadron, and that she will grant the right to lay a cable on its shores. In diplomatic circles, there is great satisfaction expressed at the amicable settlement of the question. The Brazilian capital is greatly excited over the news from Para, received today, to the effect that the French gunboat Bengali, patrolling the waters in the disputed territory of Amapa, on the frontier of French Guiana, has fired on a boat sailing under the protection of the Brazilian flag. The press of Amapa calls upon the Brazilian Government to make a vigorous protest to France. London, February 6. The report that Great Britain had recognized the sovereignty of Brazil in the Island of Trinidad, which the former recently occupied for a cable station, is semi-officially denied. The St. Paul Was Not Injured. New York, February 6. A Board of Survey examined the American Line steamer St. Paul yesterday.

MANITOBA ASSEMBLY First Session of the New Legislature Opened Yesterday. SPEECH FROM THE THRONE The Manitoba School Question Briefly Referred to More Taxation to be Imposed by the Government. Winnipeg, Man., February 6. The Speech from the Throne, at the opening of the Manitoba Legislature, was as follows: Sir Speaker and Gentlemen of the Legislative Assembly, I have great pleasure in welcoming you to the discharge of your duties at this, the first session of the Ninth Legislature of Manitoba. The harvest of the past season has been the most abundant in the history of the Province since its settlement and, no doubt, will go very far towards lessening the financial stringency which has unfavorably affected our people during the last two years. It is greatly to be deplored that the abundance of the product of the soil has been, to some extent, offset by the unusually low prices obtainable therefor. The value of such products at the point of production, as compared with the cost of conveying them to the markets of the world, emphasizes the well-known fact that the freight rates upon outgoing grain are most exorbitant, and any relief which can be obtained from such rates will be eagerly welcomed. As you are aware, it was deemed wise to anticipate the time when the Legislative Assembly would have been dissolved in the ordinary course in order to afford the people of the province an opportunity of expressing themselves on the attitude assumed by the Government in relation to the pending application of the minority for a restoration of their former privileges in regard to education. The result of the elections leaves no room for doubt that the attitude of the Government is in accord with the wishes of a large majority of the people of the province. A copy of the Order-in-Council, embodying the views and policy of my Government upon this question, will shortly be laid before you. The public accounts for the year 1903 will shortly be laid before you, and the estimates for the current year will be submitted for your consideration at an early date. It will be found that they have been prepared with due regard to economy and that no expenditure will be suggested which is not necessary to the efficiency of the public service. A consideration of the estimates, in the light of the knowledge which you possess of the requirements of the province and the increasing responsibilities of the Government, will show very clearly that the revenue of the province is entirely inadequate to supply its wants. The impossibility of meeting the just demands of my Government for needed public services, without largely exceeding the revenue, is a subject which demands your most earnest consideration. The foreign relations of the Mother Land have recently proved of an exciting and menacing character. The people of this Province join, with the rest of the Dominion, in declaring their unswerving loyalty to the Empire. It is with profound regret that I am called upon to notice the bereavement which has been sustained by Her Gracious Majesty the Queen and the members of the Royal family in the recent death of Prince Henry of Battenburg. All loyal subjects of the Empire will unite in expressing sympathy with Her Majesty and Her Royal Highness the Princess Beatrice in their affliction. Mr. Finlay, the young member for Kilkenny, was chosen Speaker of the Legislature. The House adjourned until Tuesday next. TURNING COLDER, With Strong Northwesterly Winds and Snowfalls or Flurries. Toronto, February 6, 11 p.m. The disturbance which was over the Southern States last night has since developed into a storm of unusual violence, which is now centered near New York. It has occasioned heavy rain and snow in the Lake region, a heavy snowstorm in the Ottawa and St. Lawrence valleys, and a severe gale is now telling in over the Maritime Provinces, attended by rain. Minimum and maximum temperatures: Edmonton, 10 below, 32; Calgary, 12, 20; Winnipeg, 10 below, 18; Port Arthur, 18, 28; Parry Sound, 14, 34; Toronto, 20, 30; Ottawa, 20, 34; Montreal, 32, 31; Quebec, 22, 32; Halifax, 24, 32.

She was bound from Port Townsend for St. John with five hundred tons of coal and came ashore shortly before 3 o'clock during a blinding snowstorm. Capt. Mooney and his crew of six men were safely taken off. The schooner is fast going to pieces."
"18960211","THE FISH MARKET The demand for our fish in foreign markets is still dull, and prices low. But Lent is at hand, when a great improvement is confidently expected. It must be remembered that the sea harvest of last year was unusually large; consequently, our export of dried codfish is above an average. A good land harvest means, of course, a fall in prices, and it is the same with the products of the sea. But a good harvest in either case is desirable because the profits are larger, though prices have diminished. There is, however, one way of keeping up the price of fish and preventing a glut in foreign markets which has been sadly neglected by our fish exporters. I refer to the necessity of constantly looking out for fresh markets for fish and using measures to promote its sale. In this matter, our Norwegian rivals are far ahead of us. They have agents in all the fish-consuming countries, whose duties it is to report to the Fisheries Department the prices of fish and to seek out new openings for its sale. This is one way in which their rivalry has become very formidable. Their agents take means for pushing sales and bringing the fish under the notice of consumers. Our fish merchants have never attempted this. Mr. Nielsen, Superintendent of Fisheries, has been constantly pressing this matter on their attention and urging its necessity, but in vain. They follow the ""old paths"" and ship to the same markets as their fathers. It is time that new methods were adopted. The Trade Review, for February 1st, contains an article of some importance in which the writer, on good authority, points out that the Midland Counties of England might become extensive customers for our Labrador fish, were proper measures taken to introduce it, and a little judicious ""drumming"" employed. If the article, packed in attractive style, were placed within reach of the people of the Midland Counties, the writer, from personal knowledge of the tastes and habits of the people, declares that there is an area which includes nearly half the population of the British Isles where our fish would be consumed. Now, that the old supplying system is broken up and passing away, it is to be hoped that new ideas will find admission to the mind of our exporters, and more energetic methods will be employed. Mr. Knowling is a warm advocate for this step and offers to contribute £500 to a fund designed to try the experiment and to place the Labrador fish in the market of the different towns of the English counties indicated. CONFEDERATION TALK There is no ""uncertain sound"" about Sir Charles Tupper's utterance in his election-ring speeches on the subject of Confederation. He is manly, plain, and emphatic in his declaration. It is very evident that, had he been Premier when Confederation was discussed in Ottawa last spring, there would have been no failure in the negotiations. The Canadian and British Governments then threw away a grand opportunity for ""rounding off the Dominion"" by uniting this Colony with the Great Confederacy. There is still a strong current of public sentiment among Newfoundlanders in favor of union. The Colony was in difficulties of a very serious nature. Bankruptcy seemed looming in the distance. We turned to Canada in an hour of need and honestly sought for union with a stronger and more advanced community as the best way out of our difficulties. What was the result? The terms offered by Canada were such as Newfoundland could, by no possibility, accept. We were to be saddled with five millions of our debt, and Canada must have known that this would speedily bring the Colony to bankruptcy. Lord Ripon refused to lift a finger to aid in bringing about union; and our delegates had to return and say that the terms were not such as they could recommend for acceptance. Now, no one will be surprised to learn that this unfortunate termination of the negotiations has put back union for several years. The Anti-Confederate party were in raptures, the Confederates sorely discouraged, and a general feeling of irritation engendered by the relief we met. I have been an advocate of Confederation since 1869, and have done ""my little best"" on its behalf, and felt sorely mortified by the failure. But it is no use crying over spilt milk. One day the consummation will be accomplished, but we must wait the evolution of events, and hope that when next the subject comes to the front, and a favorable opportunity presents itself, Sir Charles Tupper may be at the helm. A statesman of his broad view will take care that the next attempt at union will not prove a failure. Meantime, however, the best policy is to let the matter remain in abeyance. No good result would follow from any immediate attempt to re-open the subject. THE LABRADOR FISHERY I have obtained, lately, a reliable return of the number of Newfoundlanders who migrate to Labrador and prosecute there the summer cod fishery. In 1885 the number of vessels that took part in this fishery, after clearing from Newfoundland, was 915; tonnage, 91,447. Their crews numbered 6,330. They carried as passengers 6,820 males and 2,682 females, so that the whole number of persons employed in the Labrador fishery from Newfoundland was 14,212, being a decrease of 398, as compared with 1894. In addition, a considerable number of Canadians take part in this fishery, while the residents on the coast number about 4,000. Thus, each season, about 20,000 persons are to be found fishing on the coast of Labrador, and over 2,000 of those who take part are females. The latter have to undergo great hardship, especially during the voyages to and from the coast, and on both physical and moral grounds a law should be passed prohibiting females from taking part in this fishery. Their sufferings, when packed closely in these small vessels, are often indescribable, while there are no provisions for observing the ordinary proprieties of civilized life. The condition of this class when sickness seizes on any of them is pitiable. The importance of Dr. Grenfell's Mission to that bleak coast cannot be over-rated, but as I have frequently dwelt on this point, I need not reiterate what I have already written. By far the largest number go from the various settlements in Conception Bay. July about 100 go from St. John's. THE WEATHER During the last fortnight we have had the heaviest snowstorms experienced for thirty years. The snow now lies very deep in some places, where it drifted; the embankments are from 30 to 40 feet deep. The common roads are generally impassable and the railways have been blocked for several days. The drifts along the line are in many places from 8 to 12 feet deep, and even more. The officials have been making a gallant fight to clear the lines, and after a heavy struggle, were victorious. In a few days another snowstorm set in and the work had to be entered on again. This is altogether exceptional, for generally the snowfall is not great and comparatively little trouble has been experienced in running trains during winter. The temperature has not been very low except in two or three instances. We trust that the worst is now over. BEST All full weight. Prices reduced. For sale by George Graham, Walter Paul, J.

"18960220","THE ALDERMAN'S M FISH, Taken From the Capsule of the Deep and Brought to the Tureen, In a peculiar little city square leading out of St Mary Axe is the headquarters of the turtle trade in London, And the turtle is invariably referred to as a fish by those who know him best, The great centre of the turtle trade is Kingston, in Jamaica, The fish are chiefly caught in the Gulf of Mexico, where numerous schooners are manned by the turtle fishermen, About 3,000 turtles reach England every year, As to the question of age, it is practically impossible to ascertain how old the turtle is; centenarian fish, however, are comparatively young, The English demand for turtle soup is as strong as it ever was, though the market fluctuates strangely, If some sad event national or Court mourning throws a gloom over the country a fine fish, weighing, perhaps, 140 lbs, drops in price, say, from 14 to 6, On the other hand, the prevalence of influenza or complaints of that kind, for which turtle soup is considered one of the very best remedies, raises the value of turtle in a most extraordinary way, They are caught in the same way as fish namely, by nets, The turtles are then purchased by agents, who dispatch the unwieldy creatures to London by the P and O steamers in consignments of about 100 at a time, On board the vessel the fish are turned over to prevent them from swarming in an undesirable way all over the vessel, Sometimes, too, they are actually nailed upon the deck, On their arrival at Southampton, the turtles are brought to London in a special van, heated, A vehicle heated in a similar way conveys the turtles to the dealers' tanks, in which they remain until purchased for some banquet, quite a number die from the cold weather, A turtle is killed by the chef or his assistants mostly by decapitation, There are cases on record, in which a turtle has displayed extraordinary vitality twenty-four hours after its head has been cut off, Not long ago, a big turtle was supplied to a hotel at Newcastle, In the usual way, the chef sliced off the head, and left the big body to hang, The following evening, he had occasion to carry the headless turtle to the pantry, hereupon it suddenly shot out its flippers, and knocked the cook nearly off his feet, The driver of a van, who was unloading a consignment of turtles recently, claimed to be carrying one upon his back, and, in placing it into the tank, the turtle inflicted a terrible gash upon his face with its fin, The best known instance in the City of London, of injury sustained through a turtle, is that of a man in Leadenhall street, whose nose was snapped off by one of these ugly fish, Campos and Weyler Contrasted, In sending out Gen. Weyler to replace Martinez Campos, Spain is making her last cast the name of that General is chiefly known in connection with the brutalities of the last war, when, for ten years, from 1868 to 1878, Cuba was turned into a shambles, During the present struggle, Martinez Campos, in the face of all opposition, has insisted that the Spaniards should carry on the war after the fashion of a civilized nation, I warn you, he telegraphs to Spain, shortly before his recall, I will not alter my policy, I shoot the rebel chiefs caught in arms, and I send the prisoners to penal servitude; the rebels return our prisoners, and take care of our wounded that fall into their hands, I have given orders to shoot, on the spot, all brigands and incendiaries I cannot, and will not go beyond, In the eyes of Spain, this policy, which, in practice, resolves itself into the shooting of every prisoner, is criticised as unduly lenient and the immediate cause of the failure of the campaign, and a reign of terror is, once more, to be established under Gen. Weyler, The probable result of Spanish excesses will be reprisals at the hands of the rebels, and a speedy recognition of the belligerent rights of the insurgents by the United States, Found Dead In the Snow, Hekla, Out, February 18, The body of James McDonald, postmaster of Crieff, who perished in the snowstorm of Monday night, the 16th instant, was found today in a field about one mile west of his home, The body was almost completely covered with snow, only one of his heels being visible, He had walked nearly eight miles, and had, doubtless, become exhausted at the spot where the body was found, Beautifully the Story, A vast mass of direct, unimpeachable testimony proves beyond any possibility of doubt that Hood's Sarsaparilla actually does perfectly and permanently cure diseases caused by impure blood, Its record of cures is unequalled and these cures have often been accomplished after all other preparations had failed, Hood's Pills cure all liver ills, biliousness, jaundice, indigestion, sick headache, More than three thousand people in one Province of Russia are employed in making barrel margins, When this fact becomes more generally known, Russia will not have a friend in the world, - London Tit-Bit, ILLINOIS LYNCHING, Thirty Determined Men Hang Up an Alleged Murderer"

Heavy rains have been followed by a drifting snowstorm, so that the movements of travellers in the interior have been a good deal impeded, and general country trade has not improved since last report. City dealers have been light buyers so far at the millinery openings, but the outsiders have bought fair, as a rule. There have been a few large buyers in town, from the Northwest and British Columbia, notably some representatives of the Alaska Trading Company, who have made considerable purchases of dry goods, clothing, shoes, hats, etc., and who have been much sought after. Super refiners report enquiries as very short at the moment, as also do importers of tea and other staple lines. Collections do not improve, and applications for renewals are reported as frequent. The money market is a little easier; funds seem rather more plentiful, and it is reported some call loans have been effected at 5 percent, though some of the banks are still indisposed to do business below 6 percent. The condition of trade at Toronto is quiet and featureless. The movement is hardly up to expectations, which is partly accounted for by the severe weather. The feeling, however, seems to be improving in many lines and, with the advent of spring, merchants look forward to an increase in trade. The failures were more numerous the past week than during the preceding one, and, although remittances are not up to the mark, bankers and wholesalers say that paper has been fairly well met this month. There is little to note with regard to prices. Wheat continues to hold at about 80 cents at outside points for white and red winter grades. It is somewhat strange that, while wheat has been in good demand for milling purposes, it is almost impossible to sell flour at prices relatively $2.00 per barrel lower than wheat. There is an easier tendency in the rates for money. It is offering more freely and the central rate is 4 percent for call loans. Prime commercial paper is discounted at 6 to 7 percent. Stocks are quiet, with a better feeling. There is an improved demand for insurance and bank stocks, the latter for investment. Failures for the week 61, as against 58 for the same week of last year."

Moreover, it was one of those disagreeable days that make it very uncomfortable for the pedestrian. Many are pleased when the snow falls, but yesterday no one seemed delighted. Traffic was greatly impeded, and the Street Railway Company had great difficulty in operating their system. Between two and three o'clock p.m., the cars were at a standstill; they stood in an unbroken line at different localities along the route. This lasted for more than an hour. A Gazette representative called to see the Superintendent, Mr. McDonald, who was not in his office, but who was very busy attending to the operation of the road. An official stated that everything possible was done to overcome the difficulty; but the snow was so wet that the sweepers were impeded; the electric current was too weak to move them. Greater power than usual was necessary. At about 3:30 p.m., everything was running as smoothly as possible under the circumstances.

REMOVING THE SNOW. Mary Streets Were In a Disgraceful Condition as a Result of the Civic Policy. When Mr. St. George, the City Surveyor, asked the Finance Committee, the other day, for $20,000 to clean the streets, and when his modest request was refused, he warned them that he would not be responsible for the consequences. He had no money to do anything with, and intimated that he would be compelled to discharge four hundred men. The Chairman and his confreres pooh-poohed the idea of any emergency arising, and that ended the matter. The storm of yesterday and the day before has, however, opened the eyes of the civic fathers to the uncertainty of the weather in this northern latitude, and the consequence is that they will be compelled to vote that twenty thousand dollars in double quick time. It is safe to say that the storm could not have visited the city at a worse time. Mr. St. George was in a dilemma, he had neither the men nor the wherewithal to pay them. Still, he could not sit down idly and see the public thoroughfares blocked, and consequently the City Surveyor, who is always equal to an emergency, engaged as many men as possible to work on the street. On the main thoroughfare they did good work yesterday, but, on those less frequented, the condition of things is simply deplorable. The fall of snow, it may be stated, was the heaviest since 1881. At McGill University Observatory, yesterday morning, the gauge showed the total fall of snow, during twenty-four hours, to have been 11 inches, and the total precipitation, 2.05 inches. During the present month, 33.5 inches of snow has fallen, against 5.8 inches for the corresponding period of last year. The present snowfall is, consequently, one of the heaviest on record, being exceeded only, during the last twenty-four years, on four occasions. In March, 1870, the fall was 45.6 inches; in March, 1881, 31.1 inches; in March, 1883, 35.5 inches; and during the same month, in 1892, 34.0 inches. Mr. St. George is doing the best he can with the limited means at his disposal. He made, yesterday, the significant statement that if he had had the necessary number of men on hand when the storm set in, it would not have cost the city more than three thousand dollars. But now that the snow has been compacted, the snow ploughs can scarcely force their way through it. The sidewalks on Mtre Street, west of Cote Street, are in a disgraceful condition. Some pedestrians found this to their cost last night, when they fell heavily to the sidewalk, but, fortunately, the ambulances were not ""brought into requisition."" The recent official notice, issued by Superintendent Hughes, relative to the immediate cleaning of sidewalks, has been grossly ignored by many householders in the city. The Montreal Park and Island Railway reported their line to be all clear and in perfect running order, at about nine o'clock last evening. The snowstorm of the past two days continued to delay the arrival of the trains at Bonaventure depot. THE BONSECOURS MARKET. Supplies Small-Business Quiet, Prices Unchanged. The unusual occurrence of a superabundance of snow at the vernal equinox prevented the farmers from coming to the market today; consequently, the supplies of produce were small, and were chiefly in the hands of traders. An enterprising farmer from Ste. Marie brought a double sleigh load of over forty bags of oats thirty miles, yesterday, through all the heavy snowfall, arriving in the city at a late hour with a well tired team. This morning he was early in the market, offering his oats for sale at 76c per bag. There were also some four or five other loads of oats for sale; there were two loads of potatoes offered at 40c the bag; cabbages are about $1 per barrel; beets and carrots 60c to $1 each. There were no dressed hogs offered by farmers. Frozen turkeys, 10c per lb; geese, 7c each; chickens, 9c to 12c each; tub butter, 15c to 24c per lb; common prints butter, 20c to 25c each; superior prints, 28c to 35c each; limed eggs, 13c per dozen; packed eggs, 18c to 22c; fresh laid eggs, in baskets, 25c to 35c each. The fruit market is quiet since the snowstorm began; prices of apples are slightly higher, or from $2.60 to $5 per barrel; oranges, $5 per case; lemons, $2 to $3 the box."
"18960323","R kept their tracks open as far as Peterboro. The trains leaving Montreal on Thursday arrived in Toronto yesterday. The two Central Vermont trains, from New York and Boston, yesterday, were each six hours late. For the next few days passenger traffic is expected to be small, owing to the fear everyone has of being snowed up. Owing to the severity of the snowstorm the arrival of the mails was marked with unwonted irregularity. Mails which were due here on Friday morning did not reach the city until between three and four o'clock yesterday afternoon, and in consequence of their bulk, the regular staff were detailed for extra duty last evening. A St. Patrick's Day Dog. A dog story that is mixed up with St. Patrick's Day is going the rounds and calling up a hearty laugh at some prominent Montrealers' expense. On the morn of St. Patrick's Day, '95, there arrived at a residence on Dorchester Street West, a beautiful Irish terrier, who answered readily to the name of Pat. It was thought by these householders that such a dog, arriving on such a day, was, to say the least of it, a coincidence. The way things have panned out they are beginning to wonder if there was not something uncanny about that Irish pup. Anyway they took him in last year, and fed him on the fat of the land otherwise the remains of the dinner and he speedily became an immense favorite. Enquiries were made for its owner, but it appeared to have no owner, so it stayed right there in its new-found abode. Some few weeks ago, however, the family decided they could keep him no longer, and a member of the Westmount police force was asked if he did not know of anyone who wanted a fine dog. To be sure, he replied; there's a friend of mine in Longueuil that's just dead set on having a dog. On St. Patrick's morn, then, 1896, he called at the residence on Dorchester Street, at a very early hour, and carted the dog over to Longueuil. Great was the surprise for everyone concerned the dog included when the man who was about to be presented with the dog exclaimed: By the great powers above, the very dog I lost in Montreal last St. Patrick's Day. House of Industry Statistics. The statement of the Protestant House of Industry and Refuge, for the week ending March 21, 1896, is: Number of permanent inmates at country house 1,616. Males 73, females 66. Total 158. Number of night lodgings given in Night Refuge 968. Number in the Moore Convalescent Home 1. J. W. Longley, the Liberal Attorney-General of Nova Scotia, declares as follows: I have never spoken a word or penned a line which justified any person whomsoever in questioning my loyalty to the Empire, or devotion to the great Dominion to which we owe our best allegiance, and around which our fondest aspirations cluster. Mr. Fielding, Liberal Premier of Nova Scotia, was Mr. Longley's colleague in the Quebec Interprovincial conference of 1887, at which the following resolution was put on record: In view of recent movements in the Province of Nova Scotia, the representatives of that Province declare to place on record that they do not participate in the deliberations of the conference upon the understanding that, while they join the representatives of the other provinces in seeking reforms in matters which are of common interest, they do so without prejudice to the right of the Government, Legislature or people of Nova Scotia to take any course that may in future be, by them, deemed desirable with a view to the separation of the Province from the Dominion. It is to be presumed from Mr. Longley's latest declaration, therefore, that Mr. Fielding has spoken words or penned lines justifying any person in impugning his devotion to the great Dominion to which he owes allegiance. Talking about persuasion being better than coercion, was it to persuade Mr. Sifton to deal gently with the Manitoba minority that Mr. Laurier and Mr. Sutherland held the conference with Mr. Greenway's Attorney-General in the Windsor Hotel, just before the dissolution of the Manitoba Legislature? An answer to this query would settle the question whether the Liberal leader's practice agrees with his preaching. Having passed bills increasing the taxation and providing for raising a new loan, the New Brunswick Legislature has been prorogued. New Brunswick is in the procession with every other Province which has a Liberal Premier. There has never been in Canada a Liberal Government, Federal or Provincial, but has added to the taxes, or increased the expenditure, or enlarged the debt. A Roman Catholic bishop, in the guise of an evil brooding bat, is a frequent feature of the pictorial representations of the political situation. English papers which support Mr. Laurier are given to printing. It is hardly good policy that leads to such affronts. The Liberal party's strength in Quebec is not so surely established that its organs can afford to insult the majority of its electors. The new United States battleship Massachusetts has made fifteen knots an hour on her trial trip. She should be able to keep up with a twelve-knot merchantman in an ocean run. Past experience shows that United States naval prodigies are about 20 percent slower on the high seas than in the record of their trial trips. The latest project, in its line, is for the canonization of Mary, Queen of Scots. For the sake of her beauty and her misfortunes, the poets have forgiven Mary a multitude of sins. It is a great deal, though, to expect the church to throw the mantle of sainthood over her infirmities in the moralist's sight. The Duke of Cambridge has withdrawn his claim for a special pension of 1,800. The Duke has set an example that not even the prestige of his royal descent will make fashionable. There is a comfortableness about a nice-sized pension that is usually a set-off to the greatest sacrifice of pride. A crisis has been threatened in the Gorman Government in connection with a dispute as to the disposal of the national surplus. On this blessed American continent, just now, we are escaping a lot of the troubles that bother the administrators of the effete old world. February trade returns show an increase in both imports and exports, compared with a year ago. In the Post Office Savings Bank, also, the deposits during the month exceeded the withdrawals. These are business straws that show the trade wind to be blowing in a fair direction. Mr. Robert Buchanan, the English poet, has adopted the plan of publishing his own works, and finds that it pays. The latter feature is the novelty in the experience. There are poets who adopted the plan of publishing their own efforts, who found it did not pay. Detroit vessel men are predicting another season of low water in the upper lakes. They could not have had our recent snowstorms in the West, for else they are not allowing for the effect of spring's warmth on the streams that feed the inland seas. The Queen's health is reported to be much improved as a result of her visit to the continent. God save the Queen."

"18960328","W. Tyler, Mrs. Mackaye's lawyer, explained that, in 1891, Mackaye entered into a contract with Mr. Mallory, who had built the Madison Square Theatre, in which he agreed to give the manager his services, the copyrights on all plays he might write and the title of all inventions he might patent. In return, he was to get a salary of $5,000 a year and a percentage of the profits. The theatre was opened with Mackaye's play of ""Hazel Kirke,"" which was probably the most successful play ever produced in this country. Mr. Tyler said that Mr. Mallory made it so uncomfortable for Mackaye that the latter threw up his contract. Mr. Mallory had made half a million dollars out of ""Hazel Kirke,"" he said, and Mackaye got nothing except a year's salary. When Mackaye left Mr. Mallory, he started to play ""Hazel Kirke."" Each applied for an injunction, and Mr. Mallory won. That injunction is still in force. Mackaye sued for an accounting, and that is the suit now being urged. The amount involved, with interest, is nearly $1,000,000. Lewis Cass Ledyard, representing Mr. Mallory, said there could be no dispute as to the terms of the contract. He said Mackaye delayed the suit because the play was making money, and he wanted the amount piled up as high as possible. John Drew is on his twenty-fifth week in New York this season at the Garrick Theatre. ""The Squire of Dames"" is his second great success during this time, and its hold on New York theatre-goers seems to be growing stronger day by day. Charles H. Hooper entered upon the eleventh week of his New York run in ""Chimmie Fadden"" at the Standard Theatre. Here is some Trocadero fun: ""What was that awful noise in the room next to mine last night?"" ""Oh, that was only the new boarder falling asleep."" Mrs. Potter has been appearing at Daly's in ""The Queen's Necklace,"" and the conscientious critic still pursues her. In the dual role of Marie Antoinette and Olivia, says the Times, she was no more convincing than before, but she shone resplendent in gorgeous gowns, hats, and feathers, as the frivolous Queen, while she was no less quaint or picturesque in the dress of the more humble Parisienne. Mr. Bellow was effective, dignified, and earnest as the Cardinal de Rohan, delivering his lines with much unction and force. The rest of the cast calls for little comment, save that the Andrée de Tavarnoy of Miss Dale made a pretty picture in her simple black dress and natural arrangement of coiffure among the elaboration of the court ladies. Monday was the thirty-first anniversary of the management of Tony Pastor in New York, and, in spite of a disagreeable snowstorm, his friends turned out in great force at his theatre to celebrate the occasion. The programme was a very long one, and Mr. Pastor himself was not the least of the artists. He appeared as lively on the stage as though he were a young man, sang four songs, and begged the indulgence of his friends, who called for a fifth. In a little speech, he thanked the audience for its favors, and then the ushers came to the front and bore away the many floral tokens which had been presented to him. A Washington dispatch of Monday says: Rudolph Aronson surprised Washington tonight by putting on Zeau to do the serpentine dance at the conclusion of the performance of ""Gentleman Joe"" at the Lafayette Opera House. A startling effect was given to the dance by an arrangement of mirrors, which made it appear that several scores of Zeau were twisting in the air at once.

""No ecstasy of passion, nor mystery of pain; No furrow plowed by the heart's but mingled ruin."" ""Nor bitter sweet of love nor agony of life; Nor trace of hopeless longing from respite from its strife."" ""Mine eyes, or bright, look sadly, unlit by joy or mirth; From under hoar white tresses, or soft dark locks of youth."" ""Can warmth of summer noontides, or sound of wind-blown trees, Or subtle scent of violets borne on the jocund breeze, Or silver flush of moonbeams flooding the mystic night, Stir in these hearts no rapture, nor fill these eyes with light?""

""When King James went out of England he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with his partner Mr. Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruits of his labors in great prosperity."" ""He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men, of whom he had the conversation.""

""Mr. Pepys had been for nearly forty years so much my particular friend that Mr. Jackson sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at his magnificent obsequies, but indisposition hindered me from doing him this last office."" ""Evelyn's Diary, A Black Forest Wedding."" It is a large square room with plastered walls, and unadorned, except by two or three coarse colored prints. It is only furnished with a number of long trestle tables and forms, and around these tables are crowded the wedding guests, stolidly and continuously eating enormous cherry tarts and drinking new wine. There is nothing festive about them, and they are not beautiful to behold. The women are dressed in an ugly fashion; they wear black bodices and short black skirts plaited into an astounding thickness at the waist, and some of them have hideous tight-fitting black silk caps, tied closely under their chins with wide black strings. It would take a very pretty woman to withstand the effect of this costume, and the requisite amount of beauty is not forthcoming in X. But the bride and her bridesmaids (about fifty in number) are more gorgeously arrayed, inasmuch as they wear crowns, monstrous erections of glass beads, glittering balls, artificial flowers, and bits of tinsel, all fixed upon a cardboard foundation that towers a good foot and a half in height, and overshadows the wearer's head and face. It is wonderful how they can bear the weight of them. Some of the men are in peasant costume and some in ordinary dress; there is little of the picturesque mountaineer of our imagination. Cornhill Magazine, Parliamentary Screamer, talking on another occasion with Wagner about public opinion, the Chancellor said: ""You doubtless remember the saying of the first Napoleon that three shrieking women will make more noise than a thousand silent men. It is therefore very absurd of us to attach so much importance to the shrieking women of public opinion. True public opinion is that which is the outcome of certain political, religious, and social convictions, of a very simple kind, deep down in the national life, and to recognize and give effect to this is the task of the true statesman. I might call it the undercurrent of public opinion. Hence it is that I have never reckoned with our parliamentary screamers, and that, consequently, I have always had the satisfaction of having enlisted on my side the public opinion by which I set any store."" ""The National Assembly in St. Paul's, Frankfurt, and the Union Parliament at Elfurt, were both, in point of fact, composed of excellent speakers, and yet, what remains of them now? Swallowed up and forgotten; such is the inglorious curse."" ""Bismarck's Table Talk, Royals Know Their Seasons, We ought never to grow weary in studying the intelligence of lower animals. Take boys, for instance. They know unerringly the very day to play at marbles, the very day to drive the top. They are never premature, they are never belated. They are as methodical as the woodpecker, the mud turtle, or the wild gander leading his flock at night with a ""Ya honk!"" Boys may need watches for vulgar, material ways, but they laugh at the puny labor of the baker. During games, they have their orbits. The boy, like an astronomer, knows the precise day of their return. Shopkeepers are dimly aware of the existence of their physical phenomena, and they expose their wares accordingly. Note this, however: No healthy, normal, savage boy will buy a top or a marble one day ahead of the hour fixed, as by some unknown law, for general enjoyment."" Boston Journal, Russia and Religious Liberty, The only dissenters that the Orthodox Church has ever tolerated with any degree of goodwill have been the actual pagans from the frozen North and the Mohammedans. Neither of these can be charged with the crime of attempting to pervert others from the Orthodox faith. To speak plainly, the vaunted toleration of the Russian Government has always been of a peculiar character. No dissenting body has suffered more than the Uniats, and yet they differ from their Orthodox brethren only in acknowledging the supremacy of the Pope of Rome."

"18960414","EAD WESTERN STORM, Colorado Railways Tied up by a Snowstorm-Loss of Life Feared, Denver, Col, April 13, Denver yesterday was the center of one of the worst storms that ever blew over the western country. East of here the country is inundated with from a foot to three feet of water, while on the south and west meager reports tell of disastrous snow blizzards that have swept away every vestige of animal life in the country. At Pueblo cars were blown from the track and piled up in the ditches. Only one eastern passenger train arrived here. Up to midnight units ranged as high as twenty feet and, without shelter, there is no prospect of livestock escaping the fury of the elements. Not a train is moving on the first division of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad, while the Gulf road is blocked from here to Trinidad. The Santa Fe is the only road that is handling business, as its tracks are slightly higher than those of its competitors. Cripple Creek reports the greatest loss, and fatalities are feared in the hills surrounding the camp, where several hundred men are prospecting without any protection from the storm. Five buildings in Cripple Creek were blown down, including a three-story store and a lodging house occupied by 24 men and a residence occupied by Fred Bierberwer, paying teller of the First National Bank. The wind ranged from 50 to 80 miles an hour. At Lander, Wyo, there was a mud storm, preceded by snow that covered the ground to the depth of two inches, following this came a shower of red mud, succeeded by a fall of black mud that covered houses and people with a slimy coat. Baton, JN, Holmes, or Hermann Mudgott, now lying under sentence to be hanged on the 7th of May, has made a declaration in which he says he has committed twenty-one murders. Many of his victims were women and some of them were children. The man is a notorious liar, and has neither the fear of death nor the conscience that sometimes compels a notorious wrong-doer, as his end approaches, to seek to free his soul by confessing his sins and praying for forgiveness. He may be exaggerating the extent of his devilish work, for the sake of the sensation it will create. Only time and imagination can make known the truth in this respect. What has been learned at his trial and in the inquiries into the deaths of the Peitzel children at Toronto shows that part of his narration is true. The whole may be. He speaks of the possibility of his having acquired a homicidal mania for gain, and of his repeated crimes having produced a moral deterioration in him. Repeated commission of other crimes does sap a man's moral strength, and it may well be that when the crime is murder the effect would be more terrible. Women, whom by every instinct of nature he should have dealt kindly with, men who were his friends, little children whose innocence made their deaths doubly pitiable, all perished at his hands. He was a human brute, a creature with a clear mind but no conscience, the power of a man and the reckless impulses of a wild animal, knowing no pity and feeling no remorse. Such a being must be better dead. The statements presented at the annual meeting of the shareholders of the Canada Life Insurance Company are in keeping with what was recently said in these columns about the growth of the Canadian life insurance business. The Canada is the leader among Canadian companies, and its success encouraged others to enter the field it was cultivating with so much satisfaction to all concerned. The cash income of the Company for the year amounted to $2,734,470, of which $714,370 was from investments. After the payment of death and endowment claims, and $700,465 in profits to policyholders, and all other charges, the sum of $716,753.44 was added to the assets, which at the end of the year amounted to $10,324,476. After providing for all liabilities there is a surplus of half a million dollars to the credit of the Company. The business of the Canada Life has doubled in ten years. It is not difficult to understand why. The Protestant Ministerial Association, after reiterating its opposition to the restoration of separate school privileges to the Roman Catholics of Manitoba, goes on to declare in favor of non-sectarian schools, and concludes a series of resolutions as follows: When the Roman Catholic hierarchy refuse to allow their people to unite with Protestants on a plan of religious exercises, embracing the fundamentals of Christianity, and of Christian ethics common to, and accepted by Protestants and Roman Catholics alike, the appeal to conscience is not an intelligent one, being therefore uncharitable, unchristian and unpatriotic. This is what the conscience of the Ministerial Association leads its members to think. What conscience may lead Roman Catholics to think, the associates do not apparently care. They are of the stamp of the men who come to America from England to escape persecution for their religion, and then proceed to persecute the Quakers. So far this lesson some fifteen thousand Italian immigrants have arrived in New York, and fifteen thousand more are expected at the same date. Those people are of the poorest class, and the poorest class in Italy is very poor. The authorities are somewhat puzzled over the situation. The Italians stick to the large cities, and the large cities have quite as many poor as they can care for now. Between having too many immigrants and not being able to get enough the principal embarrassment is sometimes to the land that gets too many. Golf playing by public men on Sunday is being vigorously denounced by British Sabbatarians, and the Sabbatarians are being much sneered at in consequence. Nevertheless they are right. The public man who encourages Sunday sport encourages Sunday work, for all sport implies work by somebody in preparing for or ministering to its votaries, and when Sunday sport becomes general, Sunday work will be common. Even secularists think that a day's rest in seven is too good a thing to be abolished. A serious autumn campaign in the Soudan is now generally accepted as the result of the determination to retake Dongola for Egypt. That means the loss of a lot of British lives. It is also likely to mean that there will be no retreat after the advance is made. There comes a time when Englishmen refuse to pay without getting a recompense, and besides Gordon's there has been a lot of other British blood given for the Soudan. The announcement that the Driebund has been extended till 1902 is rather welcome in the present situation in Europe. There is no likely combination of powers that can equal the military strength of Germany, Austria and Italy, and when it is announced that they will cooperate together in offensive and defensive alliance for five years, they will need to be somewhat desperate rulers who will resolve to attack them. A report from Rhodesia says a hundred Matabele warriors have been killed by an explosion of dynamite, which the white owners had left behind in their flight from their black foes. The result is likely to be quite as effective as if the subjects of King Lo Benguela had been worsted in battle. They will have a wholesome regard hereafter for a white man's establishment, even after it has been deserted. Mr. Laurier at Valleyfield again promised that if he was returned to power the Manitoba School question would be quickly settled. This is another reason for thinking that the whole difficulty is a put-up affair of the Liberal party. Liberals passed the Manitoba School law; Liberals began the agitation against it outside of Manitoba; now Liberals want to be given the job of settling it. The St. Petersburg Novosti declares that, from an international point of view, the action of United States legislators on the Cuban question will not bear criticism. From a national point of view, however, it may bear votes. There are two sides to this as to other questions, and the effete foreigners do not see the biggest one. An official statement is now made that the breach in the United States division of the Salvation Army cannot be healed. It would be hard to suggest a sadder announcement. If a man will not agree with his own brother and sister and father, how can he hope to lead others into the path of peace? A severe snowstorm down in New Mexico will serve to remind home grumblers that climatic vagaries are not confined to northern latitudes. Liability to queer weather is widespread. DATED David Davidrov, On the 9th Instant, at Camphill Church, Queen's Park, Glasgow, by Rev. Joseph Corbelli, D.D., in the spring of 1860, he relinquished that design, and found his way by the rude and toilsome route then in vogue to the Red River settlement. The community here at that time consisted of about eight thousand persons, separated from the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, by a distance of 650 miles of country, a great part of which was owned by the Ojibway and Sioux Indians. There was no railroad in this part of the world at that time, and anyone undertaking to travel from St. Paul to Fort Garry entered upon a journey which was not only toilsome, but perilous. The aborigines all along the line were fierce and intractable, not much given to discriminating between subjects of Great Britain and citizens of the United States. Between the latter and the Indians there was much ill-feeling, and murders and assassinations of white travelers were of frequent occurrence. After enduring many hardships, Dr. Schultz reached Fort Garry, and there commenced the practice of his profession. He soon afterwards entered upon the traffic in furs, a pursuit which was very profitable in those days, but which was still held as a monopoly by the Hudson's Bay Company, who viewed Dr. Schultz's operations with no friendly eye, but, in spite of all opposition, the latter continued to carry on his operations, with great profit to himself, for some years. His negotiations with the Indians and half-breeds rendered it necessary that he should traverse a wide extent of country, and he thus gained an accurate knowledge of the topography of the country. In the spring of 1862, Dr. Schultz was unfortunate enough to be away from home when the terrible Sioux massacre occurred in Minnesota, completely cutting off connection between its frontier settlements and Fort Garry. After waiting some time in St. Paul he attempted the passage through the Indian country by the ""Crow Wing"" trail, as it was called. After many days and nights of cautious traveling, and one capture by the Indians, from which he owed his release to his ability to convince the savages that he was English and not American, he arrived safely at Pembina, whence he made his way to Fort Garry. In 1864, he became the owner and editor of the Nor'Wester, the pioneer newspaper of the Northwest, and labored hard through its columns to make known the great agricultural value of the country. His policy was, of course, diametrically opposed to that of the Hudson's Bay Company; and, as time passed by, the hostility between himself and that Company became very bitter. He subsequently disposed of the Nor'Wester to Dr. Walter Robert Brown, by whom the paper was conducted at the time of Riel's outbreak. The Riel Rebellion. In 1868 Dr. Schultz married Miss Agnes Campbell Farquharson, formerly of Georgetown, British Guiana. He soon afterwards built the house which was destined to become historical for the defense against Riel and his insurrectionary force. In the autumn of 1868 he greatly extended the fur business in which he was engaged, sending expeditions for that purpose to the far North and West. The following autumn brought with it the first muttering of the Red River rebellion, and it was seen that Dr. Schultz was a marked man. Warning letters from Riel and other insurgents were sent to him. Some openly accused him of having been the means of bringing about connection with Canada, and in the gathering of the storm there seemed to be an ominous future for him, whom many of the Canadians then in the country looked upon as their leader. He was unfortunate, too, in the situation of his residence and trading post, which were the nearest buildings to Fort Garry, and within easy range of the field guns which Riel afterwards planted to force the giving up of the Canadian Government provisions. Upon the actual breaking out of the insurrection, Dr. Schultz suffered severely, both in person and in purse. His pecuniary losses were liberally recompensed to him by the Government, but the bodily privations to which he was subjected were the means of inflicting a shock upon his constitution. After the seizure of Fort Garry by the insurgents, the loyal Canadians of the settlement were placed under surveillance. About fifty of these assembled for mutual safety at Dr. Schultz's house, about 800 yards from the fort. Here they were besieged by several hundred of Riel's followers for three days. Two mounted six-pounders were drawn by the insurgents outside the walls of Fort Garry, with their muzzles pointed in the direction of the beleaguered house. The little force inside the building was too small to enable the besieged to make a permanent resistance and at last they were compelled to surrender. They were then marched by the rebels to Fort Garry and imprisoned there. Made a Prisoner by Riel. Dr. Schultz himself, who was the especial object of Riel's hatred, was placed in solitary confinement under a strong guard. His wife, who had insisted on remaining by his side, was at first permitted to share his imprisonment, but after a few days she was forcibly separated from him, and it seemed not unlikely that this separation had been effected by Riel with a view to wreaking his vengeance on the Doctor by taking his life. Riel himself alleged that there was no intention of harming any of the prisoners, but that he considered it desirable to separate Mr. and Mrs. Schultz lest the husband should be enabled to escape through the instrumentality of his wife, who was not a pioneer, and who was permitted ingress and egress at all reasonable hours. Dr. Schultz, however, placed little reliance on Riel's word. He felt that his life was liable to be sacrificed at any moment, and he determined to make an attempt to escape. To this purpose, after being confined three weeks, he successfully accomplished. Mrs. Schultz contrived to secretly convey to him a penknife and a small gimlet. With these inadequate means he made an opening through his cell large enough to enable him to pass through into the inner quadrangle of the fort. On the night of Sunday, December 23rd, 1870, he cut into strips the buffalo robe which served for his bed, fastened one end to a projection in his cell, passed through the opening he had made in the wall, and prepared to descend to the ground outside. While he was making the descent, one of the strips of buffalo skin snapped, and he was precipitated violently to the ground. The fall rendered him temporarily lame, and caused him great suffering, but, even in this disabled condition, he managed to scramble over the outer wall near one of the bastions and found himself at liberty. He stole away in the dead of the night, and after a toilsome march of some hours in a blinding snowstorm, took refuge in the house of a friendly settler in the parish of Kildonan. Organized a Force. In the course of the next few weeks he and other Canadians organized a force about 80 strong, with a view to releasing their friends who were still imprisoned in Fort Garry. Everything being in readiness for action, a message demanding the release of the prisoners was dispatched to Riel. The demand was vigorously backed up by the influence of Mr."

"18960714","Decelles, 420 pp, Ottawa, 1806. Anyone having any acquaintance with Mr. Decelles, the librarian of Parliament, and remembering his varied accomplishments and extensive reading cannot conceive that he would produce any book that was not carefully written and well considered. His object in writing this study on the United States is to present to French-Canadian youth in a brief form some knowledge of the history of this continent, which, we judge by his preface, has been but superficially acquired even by men otherwise well educated. The object of the book indeed is apparent throughout, and it will obtain more popularity with the class to whom it is specially addressed than with the other elements of the population, who do not partake of the views and sentiments that class entertain. Not that Mr. Decelles misrepresents the facts of history. He is too practiced a writer to fall into any such blunder. It is, however, possible to give a coloring to a narrative which will have the effect of representing an event in a form not acceptable to readers who do not entertain the writer's opinions. We may instance the incidental allusion to much that happened in the French wars of the last century. One example is mentioned of the Jesuit Rasle. Mr. Decelles, speaking of this truculent priest, describes him as a missionary engaged in the colonization of the Abenaquis at Maine. That his murder, so described in the account of his death, was prompted by the desire to get the money for scalps offered by the Legislature of Massachusetts. That Rasle had many great qualities, learning and courage, and that he was not a scoundrel like that clerical ruffian, Le Loutre, is true, but he had a hatred, an intense hatred of everything English, the people, their language, their Protestantism, and he had determined that settlement in the country where he lived should not pass a certain limit. It was he who incited the Indians to attack isolated homesteads and exercise the terrorism which Mr. Decelles represents as so effective. The village of Nooidgework, where he lived, was in its turn surprised by a New England party in retaliation for this warfare. Rasle was shot dead when loading his gun; he would neither give nor take quarter. Charlevoix's description of his death is a mere fable, and the claim of Rasle to respect is with those who justify in his devotion to French interests his incentive as to the desolation of all at variance with his themes. We must likewise take exception to the few words regarding the expulsion of the Acadians. Mr. Decelles gives the ground on which the proceeding is defended, but he derides it as a wretched argument. We deny this fact. Abbe Casgrain has suppressed many items in the correspondence he has published, and misrepresented others, and with Mr. Richard a mere advocate of this ignorant and infatuated people. The assertion that the Acadians were neutral and should so have been allowed to remain is sheer nonsense. They were without the slightest education, bigoted entirely under the control of some remorseless priests of whom the ruffian Le Loutre was a type; they refused to take the oath of allegiance although continuing to live as British subjects and remained a constant threat to the small garrisons by which the country was held. They refused all compromise with the Government. Mr. Decelles cannot be ignorant of Cornwall's urgent appeal to them in 1780. ""One more my friends,"" he said, ""you are subjects of the King of Great Britain and not of France. It is true that you refused to take the oath of allegiance to our King last autumn after the declaration which I published by the King's command; I informed you that neither your situation nor your duties as subjects were at all changed by that act. It was at that time you were indebted to us for not having made you leave the country even during the winter."" The expulsion of the Acadians did not take place until five years later, in 1755. The step had long been present as unavoidable. Even as early as 1720 the Board of Trade had written from London that if the Acadians would not become good subjects they must be removed. The feeble strength of the British garrisons, the absolute ignorance of the Acadians, the incentives of the priests, the insolence of their petitions, their refusal to take any oath of loyalty, the extraordinary pretensions they were encouraged to entertain made the presence of this dangerous element of population a continual threat, the removal of which was dictated by self-preservation. The more the event is carefully and dispassionately studied, it becomes more plain that the exercise of very little common sense and honesty of behavior would have made the painful proceeding unnecessary, and that the expulsion of this turbulent population was unavoidable by the absence of these qualities, and the active exercise of their constant disloyalty. There is another element in this volume which will interfere with an entirely favorable estimate of it with all readers of history who accept it only as established by documentary evidence: the one-sided character of much of the narrative when narrating the acts of French Canadians. Thus, Montgommery's defeat at Quebec is attributed to the French-Canadian officers, Dambourgé and Chabot. Chabot we do not know as present at Quebec; Dambourgé behaved gallantly enough. With Nairne he entered a window at Sault au Matelot, but his services exact no special mention beyond that of others present. Mr. Decelles would be much puzzled to sustain his case by any citation of any memoir of the days or any recognized authority. These descriptive phrases, and they are not few, are much to be regretted. We shall content ourselves with this allusion to them, and they cannot be permitted to pass unnoticed, for they detract from the value of the book, which, without them, might have formed a textbook for the entire Dominion. Translated it could have been admitted into every English high school. It possesses much merit. It is a careful study of United States history in a brief space, and offers a good starting point for students, not well informed on the subject, desirous of knowing the history of this continent. The book may be said to divide itself into three periods. The first part describes the Colonies as they were originally formed, with the narrative of their early establishment, and a rapid survey of their constitution, viz: Virginia, New Plymouth and Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Haven, Providence and Rhode Island, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina and Georgia. An examination is also made of their forms of Government. The second division briefly relates the four wars between the English Colonies and Canada including a comparison between the French and British possessions, La Nouvelle France and New England and New York. The Revolutionary War of 1776 follows with an examination into the present Constitution of the United States, including a brief history of each Presidency down to 1802. It can be understood that limited in the content of the volume is it covers a great deal of ground. It makes no pretence to be a full narrative; its effort is narrowed to the relation of the striking events which have diversified the history of the Northern continent. Its great merit is that it is original and not a rehash of previous writers; often the cause that so little value can be attached to much that has been written on the subject. Mr. Decelles has honestly grappled with the task he undertook and has sought in reliable sources the information he has placed in a concrete form. The volume will be valuable in presenting briefly letters of events of which it is indispensable, at least on this continent, that all public men should possess some knowledge with the condition that the information, however slight, should be correct. Mr. Decelles' theory of the character of his undertaking is correct, and it has been laboriously and ably executed. His style is excellent, and he has kept perfectly before his view the old French proverb, ""Ce qui n'est pas clair n'est pas Français."" It would be well if many writers in English would condescend to remember the teaching of the saying, and not become obscure in their effort to produce fine writing. As we have felt bound to remark, Mr. Decelles appears to have thought that he was writing for his French-Canadian countrymen alone, who, from custom possibly, look for favorable comparisons with their contemporaries with the narrative of their history as hitherto given to them, and accepted as indubitable. It will do no harm to bring their attention to what the celebrated Frenchman, Volney, wrote in 1803, in his well-known work, ""Tableau du climat et du sol des États-Unis suivi d'éclaircissements sur la Colonie Française au Sciote, sur quelques Colonies Canadiennes, et sur les Sauvages."" He draws a distinction between the character of the population of the United States in the first years of this century. At this date the French Canadians had then been British subjects for forty years. He writes: ""The American settler sedately forms a plan of managing a farm. He does not rise early; but when he has once risen he spends the day in an uninterrupted series of useful labors. If the weather be fair he goes out, ploughs, fells trees, makes fences or the like; if it be wet, he takes an inventory of the contents of his house, barn and stables, repairs the doors, windows, or locks, drives nails, makes chairs or tables, and is constantly employed in rendering his habitation secure, convenient and neat. With these dispositions he will sell his farm if an opportunity offers, and retire into the woods thirty or forty miles to form a new settlement."" The French settler, on the contrary, rises early in the morning, consults his wife, takes his gun, goes shooting, or to chat with some neighbor. At other times he stays at home and spends the day in talking, paying and returning visits, for visiting and talking are so indispensable to a Frenchman from habit that throughout the whole frontier of Canada and Louisiana there is not a settler of that nation to be found whose home is not in sight of some other. ""Having several times questioned the frontier Canadians respecting the distances of times and places, I have found that, in general, they had no clear and precise idea; that they received sensations without reflecting on them; in short that they knew not how to make any calculation that was ever too little complicated. They would say to me, from this place to that is one or two pipes of tobacco; you can or you cannot reach it between sunrise and sunset, or the like. But there is not a single American settler who does not give, with precision, the number of miles or hours and weights and measures, in feet or yards, pounds or gallons, and who does not very readily make a calculation consisting of several actual and contingent elements. ""The French often blame as immoral the tradition with which an American sells and quits an estate on which he was born, or which he has purchased or improved by his own labor, to go and fix himself in another. But if we trace this idea to its source, we shall discover that it has been invented by the ultra and kept up by the laws of a people originally in a state of slavery, to bind men to the soil by the prejudices of diction at all times, the secret or avowed object of a policy afraid of losing its prey. Now, as it was for the purpose of breaking their chains, both civil and religious, that the Americans emigrated, in the first instance it was not at all surprising that emigration has become to them a habitual want, and still has, in their eyes, the charm of being an exertion of their liberty. ""There is one point which is often brought as reproach against the early British colonist, that he advanced in his settlement so unwilling a distance from the sea coast. It is reproduced by Mr. Decelles in one of his epigrammatic sentences. The fact is the New Englander or the voyager from New York went as far as he could go. Those living south of him were stopped by the Alleghanies. The comparison, indeed, is only possible with New England and New York, for every reader of history knows the difficulty that was experienced, especially by Braddock and afterwards by Bouquet in carrying supplies across the mountains, and in both cases cutting their way through them. From both these colonies named men rushed up to Lake Champlain; the dispute for sovereignty on the eastern territory, now constituting the State of Vermont, is still remembered. At Lake Champlain the water communication northwards would have taken the explorer into the center of Canada. When on the western shore to the north the Adirondack wilderness presented itself, and south, a few miles, the Hudson is met. The one river to be ascended was the Hudson. Within a short period Albany, 160 miles from the seaboard, was reached and the country settled. Beneath Albany is 20 miles West of Albany, the destruction of which when known as Collar, is one of the exploits of Frontenac mentioned by Mr. Decelles, as an example of Canadian courage and endurance. Under that aspect the fact is fairly considered; but as a feat of war, it is not a remarkable exploit to surprise a village during a snowstorm, when the whole place is wrapped in sleep, and kill indifferently men, women and children. The event, however, shows that in 1690 New York had advanced 60 miles from the coast. In 1755 Montcalm destroyed Oswego, showing that the Mohawk, the tributary of the Hudson, had been acceded to the carrying-place."
"18960901","FAST LINE TENDER, Hftfrs, Allan Contradict La Cuttl-vaiaur's Statements To the Editor of the GAirrrt: The article on the Fat AlUntie line, which appeared in Le Ctt'iratHr on Saturday and at which job quote today, contains misrepresentations of such a character that we cannot allow them to pass without contradiction. It is stated that our proposition consisted in simply saying to the Canadian Government: ""If we succeed in placing our project on the money market within a certain time, we will accept your subsidy."" This is incorrect. Therefore, tendering we had satisfied ourselves that there would be no serious difficulty in completing the necessary financial arrangements. We asked, however, for a certain delay in which to negotiate with the Canadian railroads for the handling of through traffic, and to close certain other important contracts which could not properly be done before our tender was approved. We indicated that if necessary we could dispense with this delay, but it was recognized by the Government that our request was a reasonable one and no exception was taken to it. It is further stated that if rumor can be relied upon our tender was not in conformity with the specifications prepared by the Canadian Government. Rumor cannot be relied upon, and our tender was strictly in conformity with the specifications. In a letter which accompanied the tender, we pointed out to the Government that the clauses providing for the reduction of speed during fog and snowstorms, or when in the vicinity of ice or other dangers to navigation, were not quite definite in their terms. We stated that we assumed that we should always be at liberty to slow or stop in such circumstances without incurring penalties, as such freedom was absolutely essential for the safety of the ship and those on board. This interpretation of the clauses referred to, which was accepted by the Government as a matter of course, is the only circumstance which could possibly give rise to the rumor in question. When Lt Cultlmlenr states that we did not offer to establish a 20 knot line of steamers between Canada and Europe for the present subsidy, it misrepresents the facts. The editor of this paper must know by this time that the British Government has indicated its willingness to supplement the Canadian subsidy of £750,000 by the payment of £75,000 sterling, if necessary, to secure the 20 knot service. But this circumstance is almost entirely ignored, although it obviously has a very important bearing on the question of the practicability of the proposed service. We never expressed a doubt on this question, given an adequate subsidy; and the subsidy available has now been increased by fifty percent. Le Cullirafrur is also mistaken in saying that the late Government did not accept our offer. The negotiations were complete, subject to the approval of the British Government and to the ratification of the Canadian Parliament. Should the present Government decide to ratify the action of its predecessors, there is no reason to doubt that a 20 knot service can be successfully established as soon as the steamers can be built."

Probably the swiftest vessel in the world has recently been built in France. This extraordinary craft is the seagoing torpedo vessel constructed in Havre by the well-known house of Augustin Normand, the contract requiring that it should maintain a speed of from twenty-nine to thirty knots for an hour under usual steam. At its trial trip, it seems, this vessel, the Forban, ran a distance of more than thirty-one knots in an hour, this being equivalent to about thirty-five miles, probably the greatest distance ever covered by a seagoing ship in sixty minutes, powerful engines being necessary, of course, to drive the vessel through the water at such a rapid rate. On this score, therefore, the statement is not surprising that, although the displacement of the craft is only about 150 tons, it carries engines of 3,250 horsepower. A Louisiana Hoppop. New Orleans, September 23. Near Amite City, La., this morning, John Johnson, a negro, brained with an axe John Cotton, his wife, and Merriam Hevens.

No one expected such an amount of beautiful china as filled our studio to overflowing. Our great regret was that we had so small a room in which to display the work which was far too crowded to show to advantage. But with our very limited funds we did not dare to risk taking a large room or shop, though had we foreseen the deep interest in and ready sale of the china, we need have had no compunction, for had we been in a more public place we should undoubtedly have sold not half but all our exhibit. This year our ceramic exhibition will be even more important, and we expect to add to it a loan collection of old china and fans, and we earnestly beg for your cooperation in these ventures. Our third exhibition of finished pictures was held in the spring. For this we hired Hall & Scott's rooms and went to considerable expense to make it a success, in which I think we succeeded. I also think that we may congratulate ourselves for the inauguration of Studio Day, for though like every other new step, it met with some opposition, the results seem to have proved that it was a step in the right direction. Many of the studios were crowded every open day, and even those really difficult of access were sought out. Curiously enough, if I remember, only one Studio Day was fair, the rest were unfortunately either heavy snowstorms or rain, and yet the uptown studios were all filled, sometimes to overflowing, which proves that people were desirous of becoming familiar with the work of our own artists. Already, I have had several inquiries as to the continuance of these open days. I must not omit to mention our course of twelve lectures. Everybody seemed to think them most successful and to enjoy them thoroughly. And now I think that you will agree with me that with this report of the year's work still in our minds, we have a raison d'être that we are not a useless society, and that we have a future before us. For my own part, I feel that the field before us will continue to give us ample scope for all the energy we can throw into the work, and that it will prove a fruitful field, and one which our children and grandchildren may bless us for ploughing and sowing.

Chicago, October 30. Last night a violent gust of wind, accompanied by a flurry of snow, struck this city. A two-story frame building on Henderson Avenue was blown from its foundations and wrecked. The inmates escaped. Madison, Wis., October 30. A small cyclone struck Madison about 10 o'clock last night, carrying away the Opera House roof, blowing down small buildings, trees, electric wires, etc. The damage will run up into the thousands. No one is known to have been injured. Denver, Col., October 30. Reports from Kansas and Eastern Colorado state that there is likely to be severe loss among the range cattle on account of the blizzard, which has been blowing for a day. Snow has fallen over the entire country from Olathe, Kas., and west of McCook, Neb. This had been preceded by rain that froze on the surface and then the short grass was covered by the snow, which drifted at a furious rate. Last night a general blizzard ensued and correspondents are of the opinion that when the storm abates many cattle will be found off their range and dead in the drifts. Omaha, Neb., October 30. Western Nebraska is covered with ten inches of snow, thinning out as it approaches the eastern part of the state. In some sections of the state, a high wind accompanied the snow, assuming the proportions of a blizzard. Trains are delayed and on several branches have been stuck in snowdrifts. A report from Cheyenne, Wyo., says the Overland Flyer on the Union Pacific, westbound, due there at 6:55 last night, is reported stuck in the snow between Gallatin and Big Spring, Neb. Omaha, October 30. A tremendous snowstorm has prevailed over Western Nebraska since Wednesday night and is still raging. It is one of the greatest snowstorms in many years. A high wind prevails and the snow is drifting high, which will doubtless retard railway traffic. Mrs. Starnaman's Class."

"18961113","SHOWERS OF METEORS, Their Relation to Comet - A Display Expected Tonight, To the Editor of the Gazette: Sir, The persons who are interested in the beauties of the sky (and this should include everybody out of bed after dark), should be on the lookout tonight for the November meteors. The observer should face the south and watch along the line of the ecliptic, or path of the moon, paying attention to the eastern part of the sky and looking more westerly as the hour rolls on. The November meteors apparently start from the constellation Leo, which is called the radiant point, being that part of the heavens towards which the earth is moving at the time. The brilliant first magnitude star Regulus is the most prominent object in this constellation. At this time of the year it lies in the northeast between hand and vi o'clock. Everybody knows where the Dipper is in the north, and that the two end stars of the bowl opposite the handle are called the pointers, because they point very nearly to Polaris, the north star. Now, a line drawn from the Polar star passing east of the pointers will reach the magnificent Regulus. This star is in the lower end of the handle of a nearly perfect sickle formed of beautiful stars. In 1833 the November meteors made a wonderful display that alarmed the inhabitants of the eastern part of this continent, many thinking the world was coming to an end. It was estimated that 41,000 shooting stars could be seen per hour, and the observer at Boston, Mr. Olmstead, records that there were at the maximum about half as many as the snowflakes in an ordinary snowstorm. This shower of meteors lasted over seven hours. Prof. Newton, of Yale College, was the first astronomer to investigate the subject, and his results were published in 1831. He showed that the November meteors move in a definite orbit, that their maximum brilliancy occurs about every 33 years, and by tracing back the historical records for a thousand years, the falling star displays that had terrified the ancients were none other than the November meteors. Also that the phenomenon occurred about two days earlier each century and that this was probably caused by the attraction of the planets near which the shooting stars passed. Prof. Adams, of England, demonstrated mathematically that the orbit extended beyond Uranus and had a period of about 31.5 years. The famous Italian astronomer, Schiaparelli, who discovered the so-called canals on the planet Mars, suggested the similarity in the orbit of comets and of the shooting stars in their elongated ellipses and their eccentricity, or angle, to the earth's orbit. It was then found that Temple's comet crossed the earth's path at the same point as the November meteors. The labors of Oppolzer, of Austria, and the great Le Verrier, of France, who mathematically discovered the planet Neptune, proved that the comet and the meteors were moving in the same orbit, and hence that there must be some physical connection never before suspected. There is another swarm of meteors about the 9th or 10th of August in each year. Upon investigation, it was found that they were moving in the same orbit as the second comet of 1866, with a period of 124 years. It is well known that each time a comet passes its perihelion, or point nearest the sun, it becomes reduced in brilliancy. So it seems probable from the above facts that the sun's influence tends to break up the comets and distribute their particles along its orbit, and these particles, some of them of considerable size, become luminous in passing through our atmosphere. The Austrian astronomer Biela discovered in 1826 the comet that bore his name. It had a period, or length of years, of 6.5 of our years. This remarkable comet broke into two parts in 1845 during the passage around the sun. The two comets duly appeared in 1852, but have not been seen since. After the investigation noted above, it was predicted that in 1872, at the time when the earth would reach that point in its orbit at which Biela's comet would have crossed had it been in existence, there would be a display of meteors. This prediction was also verified, and they have since been seen at regularly recurring periods. Le Verrier found that Temple's comet first became part of the solar system in A."

Most of our citizens had thought that the chrysanthemum show was canceled. It was not. In fact, it apparently had reached the height of perfection, for there were living chrysanthemums, with all the delicate tints that range from ivory white to blue black, making a pleasing contrast to the tiling of the floors. The snowball head of the Western King, which reminded one of Uncle Tom's top knot in a snowstorm, was accompanied by Lenawee, bent and tossed by shriveling age. Eve came dressed in immaculate white, and Mrs. Perrin, the bridesmaid, touched off the points of color in a delicate pink gown, slashed variously and in all manner of shapes. The idea tried to be that Cold Slaw and Adam were juxtaposed, and that the proper dish for a Golden Wedding should be chopped cabbage, without a taste of vinegar. After the chrysanthemums had been duly investigated, their joints felt, to see if they were spavined, and their general anatomy gone over, a discovery was made, and it meant that behind these joyous Japanesque specimens of floriculture there lay latent the meltings of a football team. The new brand of milks will be called Brockvillia, and they are expected to put on an exceedingly great growth this afternoon. The gentlemen who mixed up blue and white on ribbon and all the colors of the rainbow on lapels will be known this afternoon under the following names: Brockville Back, Simpson; half backs, Wratherhead, Wilkinson, McLaren; quarterback, Richardson (captain); scrimmage, Watson, Ritchie, Loosemore; left wings, Riddel, Poppenham, Dr. Bowie; right wings, Sheriff Graham, McGuire, Clarke; spare men, Tompkins, Grant and Field. McGill Back, Graecj half backs, Gillies, Dr'pkwater, Gimco; quarter, Davidson; scrimmage, McMaster, Bond, McLennan; ends, C. Sue, M. Robertson, W. Robertson, P. Site, Trenholme, Austen, Whitton. All these chrysanthemums and things will be seen on the football field on the MAAA grounds this afternoon, when the boat meet of the season should be seen here. The intermediate, in fact, may have an opportunity of showing their senior friends that there are others who know a thing or two about the game. Whether McGill or Brockville will carry off the coveted championship is simply a matter of about two to one in the eyes of the speculative public, and the two belongs to the Thousand Islands people. The match starts at 2 o'clock, the officials are satisfactory, and should the weather be fine there ought to be the biggest attendance at a football match this season. There is nothing like the good old Rugby game after all, when the autumn winds make everybody shiver and keep the young gentlemen in padded knickers warm.

The Referee Will Be Paid. The Toronto Mail and Empire says: At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the O. ARBITRATION TRIBUNAL, it is to consist of five members, two of whom are to be named by the U.S. Supreme Court. London, November 1. The Chronicle will tomorrow publish what it claims to be a complete summary of the agreement regarding the Venezuelan question. The article is entitled ""Heads of a Proposed Agreement Between Venezuela and Great Britain for the Settlement of the Venezuelan Boundary Question as Agreed Upon by Great Britain and the United States of America."" There are four heads. Under the first, the appointment of an arbitration tribunal to determine the boundary is provided for. Under the second head, provision is made for the appointment of a tribunal of five members, two to be nominated by the Supreme Court of the United States, two by the Supreme Court of Great Britain, while the fifth member is to be a jurist selected by the other members. In the event of these four members failing to agree upon the selection of the fifth member, King Oscar of Sweden and Norway will select him. The fifth member will be President of the Tribunal, and he may be a judge of either the Supreme Court of the United States, or the similar court of Great Britain. Under the third head, the Tribunal is directed to examine all the facts necessary to decide the controversy regarding the territory known to belong to the United Netherlands and the Kingdom of Spain when Great Britain acquired Guiana. Under the fourth head, it is provided that the arbitrators shall ascertain all the facts necessary to arrive at a proper decision. They must be governed in their findings by three strict rules, the most important of which provide a prescription of 50 years. The arbitrators may give effect to the right of settlers. In establishing the facts, the ordinary rules of law shall prevail. The agreement is dated November 12th, 1890, and is signed by Secretary of State Olney and Sir Julian Paunceforte, the British Ambassador to the United States. The Chronicle adds that the foregoing will be the basis of the Anglo-Venezuelan treaty. London, November 13, Treating of the settlement of the Venezuelan question, the Daily Mail, in its issue tomorrow, will comment upon certain Tory complaints that Lord Salisbury climbed down from the position he assumed by him, which was ""there was nothing to arbitrate,"" and also the complaints of some French and German critics, that Lord Salisbury has improperly exalted the United States. The paper contends that there is no doubt that Lord Salisbury did climb down somewhat, but that Secretary of State Olney did likewise. It adds that Lord Salisbury has in now be admitted the new version of the Monroe Doctrine, either theoretically or formally, but Mr. Olney has succeeded to some extent in establishing it. It will be interesting, the News concludes, to see how far Mr. Olney or his successor is willing to follow up the step. ACADIA WRECKED One Hundred Miles West of Sault Ste. Marie-The Crew Saved. Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., November 13 The steamer Acadia, several days overdue, went ashore about one hundred miles west of here. All the crew are safe. The Acadia is supposed to be a total wreck. She left Port Arthur at 11 a.m. on November 4, with a cargo of 21,000 bushels of wheat for the Ogilvie Milling Company. Everything went well until the steamer reached Michipicoten Island at 5 p.m. on November 5. Then the wind freshened up and blew very hard, and in a blinding snowstorm the captain tried to make shelter at Brule Point, and in doing so the Acadia struck a shoal about 10 p.m., and at 2 a.m. on November 6 she was full of water. At daylight the crew left her and went ashore, taking off supplies and bedding. On the morning of the 7th Captain Clifford, Steve Saxby, J. Grant, The Saxby and Jas. Miron left in a small boat for the Sault. They did not reach here until 6 p.m. today. They had very rough weather. The captain left two sailors in charge of the steamer, which is lying in about twelve feet of water and exposed to northwest, west and southwest winds. The remaining ten of the crew were left at Gargangua lighthouse, with only provisions enough to last two or three days. They will be without food if a tug is not sent to their relief at once. Capt. Clifford is unable to give the names of all the crew, but says they are all well and safe. Capt. Clifford reports that the crew of the lost steamer Mozella landed at Gargangua on November 5, 1895.

"18961126","A UNION OF INTERESTS, Hon. John Dryden Urges Ontario Cheese and Butter Makers to Combine, Toronto, November 25, Hon. John Dryden, Commissioner of Agriculture of the Province, has sent the following circular to the district and directors of the Eastern and Western Dairymen's Associations and the Creameries Association, with the object of bringing together these three bodies as one: Toronto, November 10, 1835. Dear Sir, Nearly five years ago, in an address delivered by me at the eighth annual convention of the Creameries Association, held in the town of Harriston, I used the following language, as reported in the record of that meeting: ""There cannot be any warfare between the manufacturers of cheese and butter; in fact, they are getting closer together every year, and every month of the year, and by-and-by we shall have them overlapping each other’s work, the cheese men making butter and the butter-makers making cheese."" When this is being accomplished all over the country I believe there should be a joining together of the two. When the iron is hot I should like to weld them together. Then we shall have one grand Dairymen's Association. I have never abandoned this expectation, nor doubted its desirability, and it appears to me that the present time is opportune for its accomplishment. An increasing number of cheese factories are being utilized in winter for the manufacture of butter. I estimate that 100 creameries have been in operation during the summer months. Those will no doubt continue to operate throughout the winter. From the best information I can gather I estimate that fully 40 cheese factories will also engage in the manufacture of butter during the winter months. It is therefore plain that the same individuals and the same sections of the country are equally interested in these two dairy products. Under this state of things, all that relates both to butter and cheese must necessarily be coordinated by each association, and therefore each must in the future supplement the other to some extent and cover practically the same ground. The discussion of subjects relating to the choice of cattle, the care, management, and food necessary to secure the best results, must always be the same in both cases. Each of these associations sends out instructors with the view of bringing the quality of the product towards greater excellence and uniformity. As the work of cheese and butter associations covers the same territory, instructors from each association must necessarily go over the same ground, where one instructor, competent in both cheese and butter making, could do the work equally well, and thus effect a saving in time and traveling expenses. Taking the situation as it appears at present, it seems to me eminently proper that there should be a concentration of forces with the view of greater strength and efficiency. The best object gained would be to lessen the cost of management, and thus give an increased amount towards additional instruction and inspection, so necessary to ensure uniformity of product. From a careful estimate I have made, I am of the opinion that out of the present grant fully two thousand dollars might be diverted from the expense of management toward this necessary work. The second important object gained would be the substitution of one representative body for the three at present in existence, which would rest the oversight and direction of all matters of common interest. At the present stage of our dairy industry, it seems highly important that the Department of Agriculture for the Province and Dominion should have one representative authority which might be easily reached for consultation and cooperation in carrying forward such measures as will be necessary in the extension of our markets for these products. By establishing proper cold storage facilities in transportation, we shall be provided with the aid necessary to reach these markets, but in working out the details of the scheme there must inevitably be many things demanding consideration and consultation as between the producer and those acting for the Government in the matter. It will be almost impossible for the representatives of the Government to deal with three bodies, having, it may be, different opinions, and working in some senses toward cross purposes. In the hope that my suggestion may meet with approval, I venture to suggest that the three dairy associations be amalgamated into one, and that this amalgamated association be divided into two parts, having an eastern and western board. Or, if it is thought best, the Eastern and Western Dairymen's Associations might continue to exist, but, in that case, in order to carry out my thought as previously expressed, each of these bodies should appoint an Executive Committee, consisting, say, of four members, two of whom might be specially interested in butter and two in cheese. These two committees would form a central board, whose business it should be to carry forward such work as might be of common interest to both the eastern and western divisions of the association. The representatives of the Dominion Government, in making any arrangements for carrying out the cold storage plans, would necessarily consult with this body. This leads to another departure that of employing the same secretary for both branches of the association, or for the different bodies, as the case might be, such secretary being required to give his whole time to the development of this industry; the whole scheme tends towards greater consolidation, greater unity, and greater uniformity in the work and in the results that would be achieved. If it might be deemed wise, it would be to appoint a special committee to mirror a similar committee from each of the milk associations. I am writing thus early because it may be necessary to make some alterations in the statutory provisions regarding the Association. Yours very truly, John Dryden, Commissioner of Agriculture. ERROR IN THE WEST Delay the Vancouver Twelve Hours. Excerpt: A telegram from the West last evening said that it was rumored that a heavy snowstorm had blocked the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway between Winnipeg and North Bay. On inquiry at the office of the Assistant General Manager it was stated that there was no actual blockade that they knew of, but that the heavy snowstorm had considerably interfered with the train running from the West. The express from Vancouver, due to arrive here at about 11 o'clock last evening, was first reported three, six, and finally twelve hours late, and will, therefore, only arrive in the morning. This was the only train, as far as could be learned, that was kept back by the snowstorm. The Boston express was about fifty minutes late, but this was due to other causes. All the Grand Trunk trains were reported as arriving on time."

The cars having Centre will proceed as usual by McCord, Notre Dame, through Ohtboitlez street, to St Catherine, down Bleury and back by the same route. Of course, this new arrangement does not interfere in any way with the existing Craig and Centre streets line. Death of Mr Armstrong: Mr James Armstrong, of City Hall Avenue, died at the Notre Dame Hospital on Saturday, from consumption. The deceased, who was a photo-engraver, was in the hospital for about one month. The funeral will take place this morning from 11 Grand Trunk Street to St Gabriel Church, and thence to Cote des Neiges Cemetery.

"18961224","Y, December 23, In spite of the fact that the Marlborough Athletic Club had waded successfully through a labyrinth of efforts made to prevent the 20-round battle between Kid Lavigne, of Saginaw, Mich., and Charley McKeever, of Philadelphia, at the old Puritan Athletic Club here tonight, the bout was declared off. The management were unable to put up the $2,000 purse, which was insisted on by the principals, and the latter refused to go on in consequence. The thousand or more disgusted sports who had braved the snowstorm in their eagerness to see the prominent lightweights filed out of the building disgusted and fully convinced that the ""hoodoo"" which had followed the old Puritan A.C., both under that name and as the Eureka Club, was firmly settled tonight when it made its debut as the ""Marlborough."" It was announced that the bout would be pulled off at the New York Athletic Club at Coney Island on New Year's Day.

Fatx, Minn., January 3. A blizzard is blowing in this section over an area 40 miles north and south and 60 miles east and west. Over Minnesota it has been snowing from fourteen to twenty hours, and there is from seven to sixteen inches of snow on the ground. The wind is blowing a gale from the north. The snow is damp and packs so solidly on the railway tracks that it is difficult for the snow ploughs to work through it. The snow has also made a wreck of telegraph wires to the north and west of St. Paul. All trains are still moving, though some of them are hours late. South Dakota stations say that the storm extends as far west as the Black Hills. The temperature is from 15 to 18 degrees above zero, though at 9 o'clock it was rapidly growing colder. There will be suffering among livestock if the mercury drops to zero. St. Louis, Mo., January 3. The severest rainstorm of recent years has prevailed throughout Missouri, Northern Arkansas and Indian Territory during the past 36 hours. In many places in Western Missouri the streams are overflowed, and in some places railroads have suffered from washouts. Last night the rain turned to sleet, and today a furious snowstorm is raging. The temperature has fallen 40 degrees in Missouri and Eastern Kansas in the last 24 hours, and in the latter section a genuine blizzard is sweeping over the country. At Bunnell, Mo., the Usage River has risen 15 feet and Warsaw reports a rise of 22 feet and a repetition of last winter's flood feared. At Osceola the river is out of its banks and some low lands are submerged. At Fayette the electric light power house is flooded and the city is in darkness tonight. In the vicinity of Sedalia every stream is reported out of its banks. At Lamine and Knobnoster a small cyclone prevailed last night, many trees being uprooted, but no large damage to property has been reported so far. Webb City reports heavy damage to property by rain and wind. Clinton, Warrensburg and Shelbyville suffered serious damage from the downpour. In many places in Western Missouri, the mercury has fallen almost to zero, and this drop in temperature will probably result in checking the flood. Shreveport, La., January 3. A cyclone from the southwest struck and almost literally demolished the town of Mooringsport, just north of this city, at 3:45 p.m. yesterday. Over twenty dwellings were blown down, only seven buildings being left intact. Four persons were killed and twenty injured. Eakton, Ark., January 3. At 8:40 last night a cyclone struck this town, destroying nearly every building in South Benton, and passed on in a northeasterly direction, wrecking every building in its path. In an out-house near the depot a tramp was killed. Many families are left without homes. Freight cars on the siding at the depot were turned over and wrecking crews have been at work all day clearing the tracks."

"18970114","THE HARBOR WORKS Flood Protection Not Considered by the Board, THE $117,000 APPORTIONED How It Is to Be Spent-Aid, Prefontaine Last Meeting Aid, Prefontaine presided at the meeting of the Road Committee for the last time for the month, as he leaves this evening for New York en route for Great Britain and the Continent. During the Chairman's absence Aid, Brunet will be the acting president. After the minutes had been read, Aid, Papra brought up the question of the three head foremen appointed by the Committee to look after the removal of the snow from the streets on which the Street Railway can run. He thought that it was an injustice to keep these men waiting without work or wages, and considered that they should be paid from the 1st of January. Aid, Keneault objected on the ground that the sub-foremen and the men were paid by the hour. Aid Prefontaine agreed with Aid, Dapre in so far as the head foremen were concerned, but did not think it advisable to pay the sub-foremen, for the reason that it was not known what they could earn. As the Committee was of the opinion that the three foremen should be around in readiness for the first big snowstorm, it was agreed to pay them from January 1. Aid, Brunet, Dapre and the City Surveyor were appointed to wait upon the Federal Government in regard to the lease of a certain portion of Logan Park not now the property of the city. John McDermott wrote applying for the position of secretary to the Road Department. Mr. St. George submitted the following report apportioning the $117,000 granted by the Legislature for permanent works: Craig street, repairing the wood planks $5,000; Notre Dame, centre, repairing Trinidad St, Jane, centre, asphalt paving $15,000; Notre Dame street west, paving half the street $50,000; De Livi street, sewer $31,503; Permanent sidewalks $20,000; Permanent crossings $6,000; Total $117,000. The City Surveyor, however, was appointed to make a report on the cost of paving Notre Dame street west, liaison-seuve, between Dorchester and St. Catherine streets, and Wellington from the subway to Fortune street. It was also decided to ask the Council to vary the sum of $10,000 out of the $20,000 for judgments of the Courts, in order to open the Corporation quarries as early as possible. The Chairman read the following letter from Mr. St. George: Gentlemen, I beg to draw your attention to the fact that the Harbor Commissioners by their diagram for progress of work promised to complete the Guard Pier by 1898, and that all the harbor improvements would be completed by 1897. I beg to inform you that the Harbor Commissioners have only worked on the Guard Pier, and have not taken into consideration that the city needs to widen Commissioners street, and they should, therefore, have commenced some of the piers so as to enable the city to put up the city's flood protection works. I would therefore suggest that the city should not pay any more money for the Guard Pier until we have had some definite promise from the Harbor Commissioners that they were going to do some work so as to enable the city to widen Commissioners street. I attach a plan herewith. Yours truly, Percival W. St. Gdohoe, City Surveyor. The letter was referred to the City Attorney, and a letter from the Montreal Street Railway in regard to the building of the Cote des Neiges route was sent to the Council, with instructions to take action in accordance with the opinion of the city's legal advisers, as to whether the company could be compelled to carry out their contract. The Firmite Asphalt Paving Company wrote asking for $2,220 for renewing the pavement opposite the Deaf and Dumb Institute on St. Denis street, but the letter was sent to the City Surveyor for a report. Mr. Stanley Bapg, in a communication to the Committee, offered to cede a portion of Bagg avenue to the city provided it was accepted at once and the name of the thoroughfare changed. The matter was referred to Mr. St. George. The Chairman: Well, gentlemen, will we take up the appointment of the secretary? Aid, Kinsella: Yes; if you want to do justice you will appoint an Irishman. It is impossible for anyone of this nationality to get justice either at this Committee or any other, and I may as well tell you that to your face as behind your back. The Chairman: In order to throw oil on the troubled waters I would suggest that the appointment be laid over until the reorganization of the Committee in March. This was agreed to, and before the Committee adjourned Aid, Prefontaine said that as he would be away for six or eight weeks, and as the Council would be called upon in the meantime to reorganize the various committees, it would be for that body to name a new chairman of the Roads if it deemed it wise to do so. He would not be annoyed in the least, and he merely made this statement to remove any misunderstanding that might exist. The members present agreed that Aid, Prefontaine was the right man in the right place, all expressing the hope that he would be re-elected to the office in March next. Board of Revisers. The case of Mr. James Crankshaw, advocate, who objected to his name being struck off the voters' list in St. Lawrence Ward for non-payment of the five dollar business tax, was again taken up yesterday morning by the Board of Revisers. Mr. Crankshaw explained that he had been ill when the tax should have been paid, and that furthermore one of the clerks in the city's employ had been offered the amount when he came to collect the water tax, but had refused as he (the civic official) had not been sent for the business tax. Mr. McNamee, one of the Revisers, favored the placing of Mr. Crankshaw's name on the lists, but Mr. L. Armstrong, another of the Revisers, held that the Board had no power to put names on the lists when people had neglected to pay their taxes within the specified time. Mr. Kthier, Assistant City Attorney, was called to give his opinion on the matter, and decided that according to the statutes, when a citizen neglected to pay his taxes till after December 1, he was not entitled to a vote, and that it was not within the discretionary power of the Board of Revisers to say that such parties should have the right to vote.

"18970122","THE SNOWSTORM: It Gave Work to Many Poor People The Cars Impeded The weather yesterday was seasonable; it was a welcome change to the weary pedestrians, and it was a godsend to the army of poor people, who, to a more or less extent, depend on shoveling the Beautiful. It was a big snowstorm, but it did not impede traffic to any appreciable extent. The greatest sufferer was undoubtedly the Montreal Street Railway, whose traffic throughout the city was greatly delayed. The sweepers were brought into requisition at an early hour, and worked throughout the day without intermission. The lines, however, throughout the city were either tied up completely or greatly impeded until 9 o'clock. At the corner of Seigneurs and St. Antoine Street about this time four cars were strung up for half an hour. The lines on the outskirts of the city were more or less demoralized throughout the morning. The trouble with the company was the lack of power. The 90 horse power which is exerted by the engines now in place at the power house on William Street is insufficient. The Park Island Railway Company kept up a fairly effective service, considering the difficulties to which they were called upon to meet. At the old Hull the unemployed swarmed around the corridors in the immediate vicinity of the Road Department. The majority were doomed to disappointment; only those whose names were on the list approved by the Road Committee had any chance, and several had to go away after a fruitless errand.

"18970123","C. Mrs. Beecher's Advice, Mr. Henry Ward Beecher, writing in the New York World says: Years ago I laid aside a scrap cut from a paper. A short time ago I came across it. It was entitled ""Respect Due to Wives,"" and among its paragraphs were the following: ""Do not jest with your wife on any subject where there is danger of wounding her feelings."" ""Never speak of some prominent virtue in another's wife, just to remind your own of a fault."" ""Never be inattentive to your wife in company. Nothing wounds a woman's pride more keenly or tends so much to weaken her respect and love for you."" ""If you would have a pleasant home and a cheerful wife, pass your evenings under your own roof with your wife, or take her to share social enjoyments with you."" ""Do not be stern or silent in your own house and remarkable for your social gifts elsewhere."" ""This is certainly excellent advice, and too often is greatly needed."" But in reading it now the question comes to me: Do not wives need such cautions equally with their husbands? What about the respect due to husbands? Perhaps it is the perversity said to be often found in woman's nature, but I acknowledge being somewhat behind the age and plead guilty to some little sympathy for husbands. I read these sentences again, good wives, and allow me to whisper a few questions to you. Did you never tell your husbands of some great excellence or virtue in your friend's husband, purposely to remind him of some shortcoming or fault you had seen in his own habits or character? Do you ever treat your husband, when in company, with inattention or impatience, while you politely and cordially accept the attentions of other and less noble men? Do you ever impatiently blame him in the presence of a third party? What woman is more sensitive to blame in the presence of others than a husband, when the censure comes from his wife's lips? Are you ever cross and silent in your own home with no one to entertain but your husband, yet full of life, wit, and amiability in company? While it is just that husbands should listen and receive this counsel, and by the lesson it teaches endeavor to augment the joys of home, should wives not also take its truth into their own hearts? Are we not equally liable to trespass in the same way? Aye, more so. For home is our kingdom, where we may reign supreme if we have wisdom to hold the center with a judicious hand. I have seen young people begin life with every promise of the most perfect happiness, yet make entire shipwreck of it all by their own unguarded words, impatient looks, and unrestrained tempers. A talent for spicy and brilliant repartee may enliven a party and give the highest zest and piquancy to social intercourse, endowing its possessor with a certain enviable position, but in the home circle it is a dangerous gift and, unfortunately, more frequently bestowed upon the wife than upon the husband. How often have we recoiled, as from a blow, when hearing those who should be one in heart draw comparisons prejudicial to their own companion and to the credit of another's, and we grieve to say that such remarks are quite as often heard from the wife as from her husband. Do they ever recall the vows when they gave the marriage vow they took the care of each other’s happiness and respectability into their hands to cherish and protect? God has made that bond so interlaced that all honor bestowed on one is shared by the other, and all disgrace or error that is charged to the one is equally injurious to the other. I fully understand all that is said of man's rough, abrupt, overbearing ways. There is too much truth in it. I think there is, but really, a little spice of tyranny in every man's composition, and perhaps from the days of Queen Bess up to the present time we might find enough of the same quality in our sex to contend with our claim to sisterhood. But, admitting that these are purely masculine elements, do we not know how to conquer or soften the uncomfortable and unrelenting characteristics? By gentleness and love, woman may, if she will, assert her power and God means will to subject. But arrogance and impatience will find but rough and stubborn repugnance. Man is nowhere found true to his natural impulse as in the sacred precinct of home. If one would be sure of his true character, go to the domestic circle and judge. It is not when away from home at the pursuit of business or pleasure that one sees him in natural condition. In the bosom of his family, he will be found exhibiting his true spirit. There you will learn the strength of conjugal ties, and there his true character will stand before you, either shining in excellence or shrinking into insignificance. Muffs In a Bride's Outfit What an odd conceit it was that sent a recent bride to the altar hugging a great fur muff, says a Boston Herald writer. It suited her rich reception gown to a nicety that wintry morning, and was certainly distinctly different from the white robes and prayer book that were her ""properties"" on the occasion of her first marriage a dozen years before. That fad has spread, however, to less appropriate marriages, for a muff with a white moire wedding gown is the latest sensation in the fashionable world. Mondaines and debutantes have carried them into the opera box and to the playhouse all winter, as they did once many years ago, so that the carrying of one to the altar was explainable in every feminine breast in the same moment that brought the little inward gasp of astonishment and envy. The more matronly of the brides, whose marriage abroad was of international interest, wore with her chinchilla muff of large dimensions a trained reception gown of royal blue velvet, the skirt built with five circular flounces of equal depths, unruffled, and each edged with a line of chinchilla. The bodice was of white moire antique, the waterings traced with large and small jet oloux, long stoles of cut jet hanging over each shoulder to the waist, back and front. The sleeves were tight, of the blue velvet, and topped by a quaint and odd drapery of velvet held up by an armlet of jet. The ruche that swathed the throat was of milled chinchilla bunched up with real Russian violets and loops of blue ribbon, violets forming the toque, with loops and wings of pale blue ribbon and white lace. The wrists were covered by blue velvet cuffs filled with a pale blue frill and long jabots of white lace, an edge of fur finishing the top velvet funnel. A lace handkerchief dropped from the opening of the muff on one side, but otherwise it was untrimmed. The smartest brides have had but one girl friend to assist them at their wedding, a maid of honor, who precedes the bride and her father, holds her bouquet or prayer book or muff, arranges her veil, and follows her down the aisle on the arm of the best man. She wears a big hat and carries a muff if it be morning; holds aloft a huge bouquet with tall green leaves if it be evening. The bride who has gone down to posterity as having carried an ermine muff with her wedding gown was regal in shimmering white moire silk, the plain, long-tailed skirt edged with a line of ermine. The bodice was fitted as though she were molded into it, a line of fur encircling the slender waist. The throat was cut in a small square Botticelli decolletage, edged with a narrow ermine band, and filled in with rucked white mull, which also formed the shirred choker, topped with fur and with a white lace frill cascading over the nape behind. The sleeves were small, elegantly wrinkled gigots, the cuffs edged with fur and filled with lace, the gown otherwise untrimmed, save for long sash ends of white moire behind, which, with two short rounded lappets, were edged with ermine. The veil was of lace and hung from a white paradise feather on the coiffure, the ermine muff being wide and flat, and lined with lace. Easy to Acquire Grace Every woman of society desires to be graceful on all occasions, but many find it extremely difficult to master the art, while many are compelled to acknowledge the impossibility of accomplishing the task. One woman, says the Chicago Chronicle, who was far from graceful by natural gift, but who overcame all obstacles to the attainment of the coveted faculty, tells how she did it. ""All through my girlhood days,"" she says, ""my mother lectured me on my manifold awkwardness. My walk, my carriage, my sitting down and standing up were a series of angular movements, simply intolerable to her artistic nature. But it never seemed to me that I could help it. I was made that way, and how could I change?"" ""Well, one day I chanced to read of an actress who always studied her parts before a full-length mirror, in order to be sure that her gestures were graceful. It caught my attention in some way, and I thought of it many times in the next few days. At last I came to a deliberate resolution that I would adopt her plan and see what would come of it. Thereafter all my spare hours were passed in the drawing room, where there was a large pier glass. I took my books there to read, and chose an old-fashioned armchair to sit in. At first I merely looked at my reflection after I was seated, and actually blushed at its ungainly angles. Then I observed the figure, approaching the mirror in short, jerky steps, and blushed again, until I was as dissatisfied with myself as my poor mama, and became absorbed in my endeavor to improve. I studied pictures and copied their attitudes as closely as I could. When I went to the theatre I gave earnest attention to the movements of the actresses, and when I went home tried to imitate them. ""I am afraid that all this sounds as if I had developed into a most self-conscious prig and poseur, but I can acquit myself of any such feeling. I was studying grace of motion as one might study drawing, and with no more egotism, but, indeed, most humble self-depreciation. I practiced standing until I learned to correct the fault so clearly visible in that inspiring glass, until my limp, spindly column acquired self-reliance and firmness, and the protruded chin drew back into line. I practiced walking on the line suggested by a mere chance sentence in a stylish cake for the early spring. ""She walked with rather long, rhythmic steps as if to music,"" and studied the different rhythms until I found one that seemed to me most graceful. Cotillon on Bicycles Caricaturists are already showing us quadrilles performed on bicycles in fashionable ballrooms, and many a laugh has been enjoyed over one French illustration of the particular figure in a quadrille known as La Vélocité, with all four on bicycles. The man, who is riding forward with a woman at either hand, is guiding his wheel without touching the handlebar, because both hands are engaged, but the women have each a hand on their handlebars. There is point to this drawing, because the bicycle has been introduced in a cotillon in the Government House, Melbourne, by Lady Brassey, and it is becoming the fad in Paris and London. This means that there will be bicycle cotillons in New York, in houses that are large enough, while in large halls they will, of course, become frequent. Lady Brassey's party was not a fancy dress affair. Her gentlemen wore knee breeches, buckled shoes, and lace ruffles, while the ladies were in pretty blue dresses. It is not an easy thing to take part in a bicycle cotillon unless one is an expert rider. There are intricate evolutions, which must be accomplished with certainty, because there is music to guide every movement, and a lapse would throw out the whole performance. So only the most skillful rider dares attempt to take part. It is not customary to use the bicycle more than once, so it is better that the feature should be introduced at the beginning of the evening. It may become popular, for the bicycle craze has everybody in its clutches. A Widow's Rights In France French writers of melodrama and comedies have been considerably disturbed of late by the fear that a case which was making its slow way from one court to another might ultimately be so decided as to deprive them of an ancient and valuable foundation for plays. A man who died in the town of Luueux left a will, under which his widow was to inherit his entire estate, but the husband had revealed the sordid, cruel selfishness of his nature by conditioning the widow's enjoyment of his property on her remaining a monument to his memory. In other words, if she married again she was to forfeit all except her strict dower rights, and the estate was to be divided among various relatives and charitable institutions. Naturally enough, tears soon ceased to flow for the departed husband, and the widow's just resentment of an attempt to make her serve the purpose which an inexpensive gravestone was fully able to accomplish prompted her to hear with attention and finally to grant the plea for her hand made by a new suitor. Being French, she was thrifty, and even amid the joys of a second courtship she remembered the will's obnoxious provision. So, before approaching the altar, she applied to the local tribunal for a decision as to her rights. It upheld the will. An appeal to the higher court at Caen was taken, and here the judges were of a different mind. They said that celibacy, being contrary to nature, was something which no man, alive or dead, had a right to impose, and that such an act, particularly in a country like France, where the population is stationary or waning, was contrary to public policy. Thereupon the widow rejoiced, and, without delay, bound herself once more with the pleasant chains of matrimony, while the dramatists cried in unison, ""All is lost!"" Instead, they should have cried, ""The end is not yet,"" for the other parties in interest carried the question of a husband's powers over his property to the Supreme Court of Appeal, and there the second decision has been reverted and the first emphatically reaffirmed. Reflections of a Bachelor When a woman is said to be a good housekeeper it is meant that she has a place for everything except her husband. The older a man gets the more use he has for a piece of meat and a canton flannel nightgown. If every man could see the girl he is in love with eat her dinner when nobody was watching her, there would be more old bachelors. Married women never dare admit to each other that a man will marry a woman under certain circumstances, for fear the others will look queerly at them. As it is, a man has laid out two hundred dollars for a baby his wife wants to spend a lot more for some cut little visiting cards with its name on to send around to everybody she ever knew. As soon as a man gets his first gray hairs he begins to bore his wife with his business worries. The real reason why women like cats is probably because they don't often track mud all over the floor. After a girl gets married she never gets off her old joke about cigar ashes keeping moths out of the carpet. When a girl looks so happy when she gets her engagement ring, she is thinking how she will enjoy showing it to another girl. New York Press A Song in Winter A robin chirps on the larch's spray, Hi ho, Winter will go! Sunlight shines on the dewdrop way, And under my foot I feel the beat Of the world's heart that never is still, Never is still Whatever may stay. Life out of death, as day out of night, Hey ho, Winter will go! In the dark shall glimmer a light, A delicate sheen of budding green. Then, silent, the dawn of Summer breaks, As morning breaks O'er valley and height. The tide ebbs out, and the tide flows back; Hey ho, Winter will go! Though heaven be screened by a stormy rack, It rains, and the blue sky peeps through; And, cloud-like, Winter from the earth goes from the earth That flowers in his track. Sing, robin, sing on your larch's spray, Hey ho, Winter will go! Sunlight and spring shall show us the way, And under my foot I feel the beat Of the world's heart that never is still, Never is still Whatever may stay. A bit, John Adcock In Chambers's Journal About Persons and Things Foolish and unfortunate marriages, Mrs. Lytton Linton believes, are the result, not of fate, but of careless negligence. She gives her opinion of them and of the proper position in society of elderly women in The Queen. ""Elderly women,"" she says, ""do not exist for show and beauty, but for use and comfortable guidance; and when these are wanting the very meaning of their being is wanting, too! No excuses are to be made for the slack chaperonage of the present day. It has not even the excuse of blind and congenital folly. It is an evil thing which carries its signal-manual with it, and no appeals to the spirit of the age or to the recalcitrant temper of the young, which will do this and will not do that, holds harmless the foolish mother or the silly guardian who allows the young girl an undue and untimely liberty. On her head falls the guilt of any mischief that may happen if the sorrow rests on that of the poor little curly locks who believed a knave's protestations and gave away her foolish heart in consequence. ""Upholstered furniture can be kept free from moths,"" a Western upholsterer says in a pamphlet on the subject, ""by taking the furniture outside about once a month and beating it thoroughly with a strip of ticking about an inch wide attached to a piece of broom handle. Should one hit the wood hard with this it will not mar it, while the regular rattan and wire beaters mar more parlor furniture, ruin more covers and break up more inside filling than a dozen children could do. The main reason we have moths is we are always going to beat out our upholstery furniture, but rarely get around to it. Clothing, including furs, to be stored in the wardrobe during summer can be kept entirely exempt from attack if put into new flour sacks, linen sacks, or anything of that nature, and tightly tied so that a moth cannot enter at the mouth. Chests serve the same purpose when tight enough to prevent the moths from entering. Mrs. Elizabeth M. Clark, or, as she is known in the Salvation Army, ""Captain Clark,"" is a rather remarkable young woman, quite apart from her connection with the Salvationists. She is a great niece of Bishop Clark, of Rhode Island, the presiding Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal House of Bishops, and is the daughter of a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church. She prepared for college at Wellesley, spent three years at Bryn Mawr, and then went abroad and entered the University of Zurich, where she devoted herself to the study of Teutonic philology. While there she met General Booth and had her interest aroused in the army, although she did not join it until some time later. Mothers from all parts of the country are to meet in convention in Washington on February 17. The gathering will be called the National Congress of Mothers. Many questions will be considered, all looking to the mental and physical improvement of children. The kindergarten will be one of the important topics, and another will be some plan to inculcate into the minds of children principles of patriotism and humanity, the development of noble qualities in the minds of the young and a pure and thorough mental training generally. Immediately after the first meeting of the congress, at the Arlington Hotel, Mrs. Cleveland will give a reception to the delegates and their friends. Speaking of Christmas, a woman who has had Swedish maids says they are almost perfect in any other season in the year. ""Christmas with them,"" she says, ""is a religion in itself."" One of its rites is the clearing of every cupboard and corner in the house. There are no extra half-hours or idle moments for anyone in the house, for the maids are up at unholy hours and the gentle little aid Lucretia of their scrubbings can be heard in all quarters. There will be no kick for them through the year, they say, if there is not that tempestuous cleanliness everywhere. Miss Helena Gladstone, daughter of the ex-Premier, has resigned her position at Newnham College, to remain at home, a sacrifice greatly appreciated, it is said, by Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone. As Vice Principal of Newnham, she was for a long time associated and on friendly terms with Sir Henry Sidgwick, the Principal, brother of Arthur Balfour, notwithstanding the latter's opposition to Mr. Gladstone in politics. A great interest is taken in politics at Newnham. A handsome material which has the effect of woolen good and which will be cool and comfortable for summer wear is canvas dress cloth.

Electric Light From the Car Axle The performance of chair car No. 1132, on the Santa Fe route, equipped with the new system of electric light, generated from the car axle, is being watched with considerable interest. This car, when first cut into service, made about 2,400 miles in the local run between Chicago and Streator, when its electrical capacity was put to severe test, on account of the slow speed and frequent stops of the train. On January 2 it was put on trains Nos. 6 and 6 in the Denver service. On that day it ran through a heavy rainstorm, followed by freezing weather and a snowstorm in the West. It remained in Denver only one hour and ten minutes, and completed its first successful round trip to Chicago, 2,418 miles, in 84 hours on January 6. It is now operating regularly in this service. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company has had two experts on this car ever since it began running to Denver. When the train is running, the light is taken direct from the dynamo, and when running at less speed than eight miles per hour, or standing still, it is taken automatically from the storage batteries. In both cases the light is brilliant. At the request of the Burlington experts, the capacity of the storage batteries was tested, in actual practice, on one of the runs, by disconnecting the dynamo on January 8 at 3:30 o'clock p.m. and not connecting it again until 7 o'clock the next morning, lighting all the time, with the result that there was still considerable, probably four hours, light left in the batteries when the dynamo was reconnected. This dynamo makes over 4.5 million revolutions in the round trip between Chicago and Denver. If the pseudonymous authors of A M w About Clown (a three-act musical farce produced at the Avenue Theatre), who describe themselves conjointly as ""Mr. Huan Wee,"" are to be congratulated upon nothing else, they deserve some credit for avoiding the common pitfalls of coarseness and blatant vulgarity, two characteristics of modern farce which it is high time were abolished. The play is in no sense a particularly good one, nor is it anywhere hopelessly bad, and it is certainly better than many that have met with success in the last few years. The plot, which is a lineal descendant from Our Flat, turns upon the machinations of one Frank Ennesleigh, a man about town, to return to his clubs, from which his strong-minded wife Nora has held him back. He ""annexes"" an opera, ""The Tortoiseshell Cat,"" an adaptation from a French piece, ""Le Chat Noir,"" which he gives out as his own work. In order to overcome his wife's scruples as to his clubs, he adopts the rather obvious subterfuge of declaring that theatrical managers are only to be found in the small hours, and to find one who will produce his opera he must haunt the various theatrical clubs. Nora herself goes to work to find a manager on her own account, and, ultimately succeeding, she tells the opera. A Frenchman, Henri Lavelle, the real author of the opera, thereupon appears, and a series of complications ensue, which are increased when Nora accepts the manager's offer of an engagement as a dancer, and at rehearsals meets Gwendoline Grova, the prima donna of the company, an intimate and clandestine friend of Nora's husband. Of course, the complications are all ultimately smoothed over, but in a rather slipshod manner. As the ""hero,"" Mr. Lonnen worked hard and danced with his usual vigor; Miss Alma Stanley had most of the airs of prima donna, but Miss Alice Lethbridge (Nora) brought none too much art to bear on her intrigues, while her dancing was often more vigorous than graceful. Miss May Kdouin was a vivacious parlormaid, and earned an encore for her wild tarantella in the third act. Woman of the World (to youthful admirer): You seem to know a great deal about married life. Are you married? Youthful Admirer (with a blissful air): No, but my father is. London Household Words A SECRET TREATY Has Been Signed Between Russia and China IT GIVES RUSSIA CONTROL Of the Most Important Chinese Ports and is Sure to Cause Trouble Before Long (London Times Correspondence) Although some organ of the Russian press, the official paper remaining on exactly silent, have published paragraphs that the uninitiated might regard as an unqualified contradiction of the conclusion of any Russo-Chinese treaty, those who are well informed about the Far East have little doubt that a secret treaty has been actually signed and ratified between Russia and China, and their conviction is not in any sense shaken by the publication of the charter of the Russo-Chinese bank for the construction of the projected Manchurian Railway. That charter could never have been granted properly without the Emperor of China. It must have emanated from, and have been the immediate consequence of, a formal treaty. The rough draft of this treaty was drawn up in Peking before Li Hung Chang left on his European mission; the treaty itself was signed by Li Hong Chang and the late Prince Lobanov in Russia, and the cause of Count Cassini's delay in taking his departure from the Chinese capital was the hesitation of the Chinese Government to ratify the treaty. We are told that the Russian diplomatist remained in Peking with his mules and camels in the yard of the Legation for several weeks in readiness for his departure from the Uralian steppe until he had obtained the ratification. His great work as a diplomatist was now accomplished; he returned home, not with a convention freshly signed that might never see practical significance, but with a secret treaty that had passed through all the stages until it had become absolutely binding on both signatories. Since Gen. Ignatieff, in 1850, could induce the Chinese Government into signing the treaty which gave Russia an immense territory on the Amur and Ussuri, larger than many important European kingdoms, no such diplomatic success has fallen to the lot of any Minister at Peking like that just achieved by Count Cassini. On the publication of the text the other day, the alleged concessions were received with general expressions of incredulity, and as indications rather of what Russia wanted than of what she had obtained. But the news from the Far East by the later mails makes their truth appear only too certain. THE RUSSIAN PROVISIONS The Russian organ Le Nord has affirmed that this agreement is nothing more than a railway convention, and the explanation it indicated has been faithfully followed ever since in all the communications dispatched from Russia. Their object is to diminish its significance, but that is no reason for our following their lead. The most cursory examination of its clauses suffices to show that it is tantamount to a treaty of alliance between Russia and China, or, more correctly, to a protectorate in which the former is content that the latter should take only a passive part. The ninth clause refers specifically to the possibility of military operations arising suddenly ""in this continent"" where ""it will naturally be difficult for the Russian fleet to move about freely and at pleasure."" It may be observed that the likelihood of a sudden emergency arising must have been present to the minds of the negotiators, and external attack could only have come from the side of Japan. In consequence of the natural disadvantage to the Russians from the want of an open harbor, China leases the advantageous port of Kiao-chau to them, although ""should there be no danger of military operations, Russia will not enter immediately into possession, in order to obviate the chance of exciting the jealousy and suspicions of other powers."" But it will be noted that China has made this important concession to Russia in view of possible military operations in the continent of Asia with supreme disregard of the fact that, unless those operations were directed against China herself, it must involve a flagrant breach of the laws of neutrality. The next clause affords further evidence that the military stipulations of this treaty have a greater and more immediate importance than those relating to the Siberian and Manchurian railways, great as they undoubtedly are. In this stress is laid on the part that China herself has to take in the matter. The Liao-tung ports, Talienwan and Port Arthur, are declared to be ""important strategical points,"" and China accepts the obligation ""to properly fortify them with all haste and to repair all their fortifications."" On her side, Russia will lend all necessary assistance in protecting these ports, and will not permit any foreign power to encroach upon them. China is never to cede them to another power, but she consents to allow Russia, if suddenly involved in war, although China may have nothing to do with the contest, to temporarily concentrate her land and naval forces at these ports. A marked feature of all these stipulations is that no obligation of active participation is imposed on China, and it does not appear to be an indispensable condition of their being put into force that China herself should be engaged in hostilities; her part is to be the passive one of placing her best military harbors and her most important strategical positions at the disposal of Russia. It is again necessary to point out that China has acquiesced in these arrangements in complete disregard of the fact that under the most probable contingencies their fulfillment would entail a flagrant breach of the laws of neutrality."

Great Britain Is Suffering From a Big Snow Storm, OBJECT TO CONSCRIPTION. New Chinese Minister to Great Britain Imprisonment of Lady Scott-Duke of York Not Coming to Canada. Don't miss ""Trilby,"" Queen's Theatre, this week. Charming Bibyl Johnstons in ""Trilby,"" John O. Dixon (Dentist) as ""Svengali."" New York, January 24. A London special cable to the Sun says: All London is of the opinion that the weather is the most important matter of human interest today. Since noon yesterday there have been several brisk flurries of snow, with the result that there is a thin blanket averaging an inch in thickness in the parks and gardens of the metropolis. This is so extraordinary in London that the newspapers describe it as a blizzard and everybody is talking about the terrible snowstorm. Sensational telegrams from all parts of Great Britain describe in vivid language the ravages of the storm. The most startling dispatch of all comes from a point in the far north of Scotland, where a rash correspondent affirms that the snow lies six inches deep on a level. Londoners accept such statements only with a grain of salt. It is more than five years since snow has been seen in London in its present quantities, and its appearance is regarded as in the nature of a phenomenon. It has, indeed, worked a wonderful transformation of the blackest, gloomiest city in all the world. London architects, even in the brightest weather, wear a universal hue of shades and charcoal. Its most famous buildings are dressed in perpetual mourning. Now, in spite of the lowering skies, the city has put on gala attire. The solemn old town is almost gay. Even as I write, the clouds have suddenly broken and a flood of rosy light is bathing the great dome of St. Paul's in wonderful splendor. It is no longer a black, imposing silhouette against the sky, but a great, pink, glowing dome, which seems to shine with an incandescence all its own. A special cable from Paris to the Herald says: Most unusual weather prevails in Paris. Snow falls in thick showers, then comes bright sunshine like May or June, only, however, to last for a tantalizing five minutes. Great black clouds loom up again, and down comes the snow again and the thermometer remains about 48 degrees Fahrenheit. The streets are full of chocolate, cream-colored slush, and toward evening, when it begins to freeze, the cab horses slip about and tumble, breaking the shafts as they fall. This mixture of snow and sunshine and drizzle has lasted forty-eight hours, and there is no sign yet of its letting up. Object to the Conscription Law. Advices from Belgium show a serious state of affairs there, arising from the conscription law, which provides that every man who has completed his 19th year is liable to military duty for eight years, of which, however, two-thirds are allowed, as a rule, on indemnity. An important clause of the law provides that a conscript may purchase a substitute, and it is this clause that causes the trouble. Wealthy young men are able to purchase exemption, which they do in large numbers, by getting substitutes, and thus, practically speaking, the whole military service of the country falls upon those who are the least qualified by their domestic duties to perform it. Great discontent prevails against the system which takes young men from their employment, and it is anticipated that trouble will follow the drawing of 1897 conscripts in February. The Government has received information that an organized resistance is being prepared in which the socialists, who include a very large proportion of the workingmen of the country, are taking a most active part. The young men liable to the conscription are resolved not to serve, and all the labor leagues have promised to back them up in their resistance to the Government. Already military preparations have been made to meet the trouble. New Chinese Minister. The new Chinese Minister to England, Li Feng Lo, is expected to arrive in London early in June. He brings some magnificent presents to the Queen, at whose demand jubilee fetes he is to figure. The Foreign Office, which has never got on well with the present Chinese Minister, expects to find in Lo Feng Lo a better medium of communication with Peking. He knows English, French, and German, was Li Hung Chang's interpreter at Tien Tsin, and subsequently Li's Minister of the Navy, and accompanied Li on his recent visit to the continent and England. Lo Feng Lo is credited with a strong preference for English-built warships, and is said to have almost carte blanche in the disposal of Chinese money for English building yards. Advices from Tien Tsin state that Sheng, the new Tsungli of Tien Tsin and director of telegraphs and railways, is favoring with his support the American syndicate with which Mr. Huntingdon is connected. Sheng's influence is already great. He is spoken of as the coming man, who will eventually take control of affairs touching foreign interests, the place now held by Li Hung Chang. He backs the American syndicate for the construction of the railway between Hankow and Peking. Lady Scott. The consideration with which Lady Booth, who was recently sentenced to eight months' imprisonment for libeling her son-in-law, Earl Russell, is treated in Holloway Prison, finds adverse criticism even in fashionable circles. The last titled lady sent to Holloway was the Duchess of Sutherland, now Lady Eolith. But hers was not a criminal case, the offense being contempt of court. A strong opinion now prevails in society that Lady Scott has been too leniently dealt with. The tide has turned toward Earl Russell. Lady Scott's imprisonment is attended with amenities, such as was accorded to the Duchess of Sutherland. Two rooms have been specially furnished for her by her son-in-law, Dick Russell, who paid the costs of the trial. Her wine and food, papers and books are supplied from outside. A specially-paid matron waits upon her. Lady Scott will shortly plead that her health is breaking down from the confinement, but if public opinion be regarded, the Home Office will require the full term to be served. Min op and Personal.

Owing to the severe snowstorm which was prevailing on Monday, the train was four hours late. Outremont's Council. The new Council of the municipality of Outremont met last evening and organized by electing Mr. E. A. Barnard, who read a paper on the Advantages of Applying Barnyard Manure to Grass Land Instead of to Ploughed Land. The advantage of applying barnyard manure to grass land instead of to ploughed land, it is laid, may be divided into two distinct problems: First, when is it best to use farm manure as a top dressing to grass land? Second, when can such manure be made more profitable in the preparing of soil intended for future grass fields? This brings to our minds a third problem: How can farmers secure the best and most economical grass crops for hay and pasture? In this climate of great heat and possible protracted droughts in summer and fall, of great cold, extremes of rain and thaws, with snowstorms at one time fully protecting the grass; at another, of high winds driving the snow away from the field into fence corners and highways, leaving bare most of the fields; grass land must be kept in excellent heart, in order to withstand the straits it is so often subjected to. Nothing, therefore, can be more useful to ordinary grass lands, especially such as show evident signs of impoverishment, than a sufficient application of barnyard manure, or of any similar top dressing, provided it be applied in good time, in order to secure a coating of aftermath, growing through such top dressing, and forming, so to speak, a comfortable blanket and protection against the many attacks of our changeable winter season. But in order to be advantageous, such top dressing should be applied in moist weather, in the summer months and early fall, at the latest before winter frosts. In continued dry weather, the top dressing becomes parched up, absorbs the heat, and certainly does little or no good. This very question of the best time to apply manure to grass land brings up another, respecting the carrying of fresh or green manure direct from the stables and byres to the fields during our Canadian winter months. Freshly made farm manure is, no doubt, mainly composed of insoluble matter which is not easily washed out, and carried away, even by excessive rains and melting snows, often causing freshets over the manured fields, from neighboring streams, etc. But the immediate, active value of all manure consists only of such parts as are soluble in water. All urine is highly soluble. Manure must be made most carefully, by collecting very fully, and mixing together both solids and liquids, without allowing, if possible, any loss whatever. It should then be carried to the field, and, if possible again, spread at once, either as top dressing on grass land, or on any field ready to be ploughed up, without loss of time. This certainly is the best method of all. The next best is the old Scotch system of carrying manure, without loss of time or of essential parts, to the field where wanted, putting it up at once carefully into well-shaped heaps in a convenient place, protected from running water in order to prevent any loss on this score, and also where it can be easily distributed over the field without interfering with the needed farm operations. This system is certainly more laborious than the new American notion of winter spreading on snow fields, but, in my opinion at least, it is greatly more profitable and, therefore, economical in the long run. Our modern farm manure distributor has proved to be the quickest, cheapest and most perfect manner of spreading farm manure, composts, etc., on grass land, or any land ready to be ploughed up. A word now on COMPOST FOR GRASS LANDS. Around Montreal and other large centers in Canada, most farmers living in the vicinity can secure from such centers all the manure they need, without having to produce it. It cannot be so, however, with the great majority of farmers living at some distance from cities and large villages. They must either purchase an abundant supply of cattle food, in order to feed properly more stock than the farm can naturally carry; or they can supplement what farm manure they make by the purchase of a considerable quantity of commercial fertilizers; or again, and this is what most of us do, unfortunately they first allow their farms to run down in fertility; they are then forced to be satisfied with average crops, which, all over the older province of Canada, are getting smaller and smaller all the time, and to an alarming degree on many farms. All those who look carefully into this very serious national problem must admit that the main reason why most farms have thus run down in fertility is by wasting every day in the year some, and even many courses of fertility on such farms. Mr. Barnard then disposed of the second problem: Would farmyard manure be better employed in the preparation of the soil intended for grass land, than as top dressing such grass land as we have? Put in this way the problem sounds somewhat like a dilemma; for existing grass land must be kept in full fertility in order to give with some certainty abundant, remunerative crops. But it is next to impossible, as we now commonly farm, at a distance from city farm manures, to bring a more or less exhausted field into the proper heart needed to secure a good catch of grass seeds, and again, abundant crops from each seeding if the manure goes to partially exhausted grass fields. In both cases abundant fertility is indispensable to large average crops, and if a choice has forcibly to be made, between top dressing existing grass land, no matter how poor, or in carrying the farmyard manure into the field being prepared for a grass crop in the near future, since this field must be turned into grass land, let it have the manure, for without it the chances of growing profitable crops of grass on such field would be very slim indeed. The final problem now comes up: How can farmers secure the best and most economical grass crops? In speaking of composts, of stopping all WASTE OF FARM FERTILITY, of purchasing such fertilizing material as is indispensable to the full production of grass crops, most of the needed solution to this problem has been given. If we would only practice what the best experience of knowing men has taught us of late, we would add to the needed composts to be made on the farm and around the farm kitchen, some dry muck, if such can be conveniently found at a reasonable distance. If muck is not at hand, we can always find any quantity we want of old turf, along fence corners and ditches, or plough some up from an old grass field conveniently situated and destined to be ploughed up for a grain crop. Such turf we would secure at odd times in midsummer, cut it up and set it edgeways to have it thoroughly dried. Muck or dry turf should then be put under cover, to be used up as a disinfectant, whenever fermenting material is going to waste. It should also be largely used wherever urine is being lost or wasted in stables, pig and sheep pens, etc., and also plentifully in the henhouse, where it will be useful as food as well as a scratching ground. Such muck would very soon become invaluable as compost material. To such compost we would add all other material, as wood ashes, weeds from the garden, soapsuds, etc., and again more dry muck, some purchased superphosphate, and possibly potash salts, if obtained of good quality at reasonable rates. Such well-fermented compost would prove as useful a top dressing on grass land as ordinary farm manure would in most cases. And, again, in order to increase greatly future crops and also the fertility of the farm, the spreading, before ploughing in the fall, on all fields intended for clover, 200 pounds or so per acre, of good, rich, plain superphosphate, and somewhat more of potash salts. These special fertilizers will add great strength to the growing clover. This, in turn, will catch from the atmosphere, without additional cost, a very large quantity indeed of nitrogen, a most useful, but also a very costly fertilizer if purchased as such. What is said of clover applies equally to peas, vetches and all leguminous plants which, when abundantly supplied with phosphoric acid and potash, are thus made hungry for the atmospheric nitrogen so cheaply secured in this form, and yet so much needed on all farms. Thus would both our grass field and the whole farm become more and more profitable."

At the Bonaventure Depot, the Halifax train was one hour and thirty minutes late, the Boston train was three hours behind time, while the passengers who came from New York on the Delaware Hudson Railway were one hour and fifty minutes late in reaching the city. The other New York train, via the Central Vermont, which was due at 10:19 p.m., was not expected to reach the city until three in the morning. The train conveying the British mills from Halifax, due in the city at 8 o'clock last evening, was four hours late, having been hindered in its progress by the snowstorm. Longueuil's Winter Ferry. By a vote of 6 to 2, the Longueuil Town Council has decided to impose a tax of $25 upon each of the omnibuses that are now running across the ice between Montreal and Longueuil. Carters have been in the habit of charging fifteen cents for each drive; but the proprietor of the omnibuses has cut the rate to five cents for a single trip, or six trips for a quarter. This roused the indignation of the carters, who had to pay license fees to the town of Longueuil, and the result of an agitation they started was the decision to impose the $5 tax on the omnibuses, a step which does not meet with the general approval of the townspeople, many of whom have business to attend to in the city daily. It is probable that they will hold an indignation meeting soon to protest against the Council's action. Law Faculty Dinner. The Law Faculty of McGill University held their annual banquet in the Ladies' Ordinary of the Windsor last evening. The attendance was limited to the faculty, the students, several representatives of the profession in Montreal, and delegates from the other faculties. Lieut.-Col. W. Committee. General Manager Cowans declares there is no breach of faith on his part as regards Henry Rea, whom the men insist shall be taken back at the same time as they are given work. He says he has done all that is reasonable in offering to re-employ Rea by the 15th of February. The strikers, however, insist that Rea must return to work with them. MORE SNOW TODAY, With About the Same Temperature as Yesterday. Toronto, Ont., January 28, 11 p.m. The depression which was travelling up the Atlantic Coast last night is now centered over the Bay of Fundy as a severe storm. It is causing a heavy snowstorm and strong gales throughout the Maritime Provinces. The Northwest cold wave has considerably moderated. Minimum and maximum temperature: Esquimalt, 30, 34; Calgary, 34 below, 10; Qu'Appelle, 16 below, 4 below; Winnipeg, 6 below, 10; Parry Sound, 16, 22; Toronto, 12, 22; Ottawa, 14, 20; Montreal, 12, 18; Quebec, 8, 18; Halifax, 12, 34. Georgian Bay, Ottawa Valley and St. Lawrence, Upper Westerly to northwesterly winds; light snowfalls in many places today; fair tomorrow; stationary or lower temperature. Lake St. Lawrence and Gulf Unsettled, with snow and high winds. Montreal Record. Observations taken at McGill College Observatory January 27. Wind Weather Snow, N."

Dadson The committee in charge of raising a subscription for the purpose of building a new church for St. Matthias' congregation in Westmount has done admirably well during the short time they have been at work, collecting the nice sum of $4,300. The funeral of the late Mr. Albert E. Hughes, who died in New York on Thursday, will take place on Monday morning at 8:45 sharp, from his brother's residence, Lieut.-Col. Hughes, 352 St. Denis street, to St. James Church, and thence to Cote des Neiges Cemetery. The Council of St. Henri are petitioning the Government to build a bridge across the canal at St. Elizabeth street. This was decided at a meeting of the Council on the motion of Councillor Senecal. The vote resulted in a tie, and the Mayor cast the deciding vote in favor of the motion. The snowstorm, which prevailed the whole of Thursday, was felt by the railroads yesterday. Although the whole of the Western trains arrived on time, the Delaware & Hudson train was 20 minutes late, Central Vermont train from New York was 45 minutes late, the Boston train one hour late, and the Halifax train 1½ hours late. THE HIGHLAND CADETS Present ""Jessie Brown"" at the Monument National. It is to be regretted that the entertainment given in aid of the Highland Cadets' Clothing Fund in the Monument National last evening was not better patronized. It was not the encouragement that the kilted lads deserved. It is safe to say that if the entertainment had been in aid of the Mount St. Louis or St. Mary's Cadets, the hall would have been crowded to the doors by the French-Canadian people. The piece selected for presentation was ""Jessie Brown, or the Relief of Lucknow."" The play was well staged and well presented. The Nana Sahib of Mr. Josh Ward was a surprise to all. It was a capital representation, and Josh certainly made a hit."

"18970223","B. Williams read some interesting notes on the Horned Screamer, and Rev. Dr. Campbell gave a very enjoyable talk on Canadian Plants collected in 1896 from widely separated districts outside the island of Montreal. He exhibited a large number of dried specimens, including some very rare ones, the existence of which in Canada had been doubted. Henry Barron's Death: The Coroner yesterday morning opened an inquest on the body of the late Henry Barron, who, about a week ago, was admitted to the General Hospital suffering from injuries received to one of his legs by being run over by a train in the vicinity of Peterborough. He died from the effects of these injuries on Friday night. As there was no positive information that the accident occurred at Peterborough, the Coroner adjourned the inquest until Friday, so as to allow him to obtain further information regarding the accident, which ended fatally. Street Cars Delayed: Businessmen residing in the western part of the city were put to a little inconvenience last evening owing to the difficulty which the street railway people had with their cars. The snow had made the tracks so slippery that the Windsor cars found it impossible to get up St. Lambert's Hill. The cars of the same line going up St. Lawrence Street were also blocked at the hill. Around half past six and seven o'clock there was many a tired man seen ""footing it"" home or walking up to St. Catherine Street where the traffic was not interfered with. Cosmopolitan Foresters: Yesterday morning Mr. Justice Gill, on the petition of Mr. Antoine Kelley, issued an order that all the officers, members, and creditors of the Supreme Court of the Cosmopolitan Order of Foresters be summoned to meet in the Court House on the 3rd of March next at 10:30 a.m. to give their opinion as to the dissolution or putting into liquidation of the organization. Mr. Kelley, who petitions for the liquidation, alleges that the organization, which was incorporated in 1892, has been insolvent for a year back. An Immigration Special: The first immigration special of the season arrived at the Windsor Station yesterday from Halifax with some one hundred and fifty of the immigrant passengers from the steamship Labrador. They were met on arrival by Messrs. Hoolihan and Marquette, Dominion and Provincial Immigration Agents respectively, and Mr. Fairbrass of Andrew's Home, Belmont Park. Needless to say, all the people were well looked after, and all that was possible done for their comfort during their stay in the city. Injured In an Ice House: Yesterday forenoon the Notre Dame Hospital ambulance was called out to the Hackett Ice House, corner Fulford and Richelieu streets, for George Beaudry, an employee, who, while working there, was unfortunate enough to have a piece of ice fall on his right leg, which smashed it badly below the knee. One bone was extracted while another may be. In fact, amputation of that leg may be necessary. Beaudry is also suffering from a bad scalp wound over the right eye. Lecture at Art Gallery Tonight: This evening, in the Art Gallery, Phillips Square, at 8:15, Principal Peterson of McGill University will deliver the second of the course of lectures instituted by the Association of Architects of the Province of Quebec. The subject of the lecture will be The Monuments of Athens, illustrated by stereopticon views. As Principal Peterson is a well-known authority on Greek literature and art, it is safe to promise a most profitable and enjoyable evening. Mortality Statistics: There were 133 interments in the city cemeteries for the week ending February 20, 114 in the Catholic, 10 in the Protestant, and 3 Jews. The deaths were as under: Diphtheria, 0; diphtheritic croup, 1; croup, 1; typhoid fever, 1; measles, 4; whooping cough, 3; consumption, 28; bronchitis, 12; broncho-pneumonia, 10; congestion of the lungs, 2; pneumonia, 4; and infantile debility, 17. Death of Mrs. Hanson: Mr. William Hanson of the firm of Bawn Brothers will have the sympathy of a large circle of friends on account of the death of his wife, which took place on Sunday. The deceased lady, who was highly esteemed in social circles for her many notable qualities, was a daughter of Mr. Edward McDaly of London, Ont., and a cousin to Miss Louise McDaly, so well known in the musical world. Aid Turner's Bereavement: The many friends of Aid Turner, the popular representative for St. Gabriel Ward, will regret to learn of the death of his wife, which occurred yesterday morning after a long illness. The funeral is announced to take place tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock, from Alderman Turner's residence, 601 Wellington Street, to the Centenary Methodist Church. Christianity In Central Africa: Professor Caius-Wilson's lecture on Uganda, illustrated by stereopticon views, will be repeated once more in St. Jude's parish room on Friday next at 8 o'clock. He is giving it at the special request of Canon Dixon, the missionary who hopes to go out to that interesting field this summer, being a member of his congregation. St. Patrick's Catechism: On St. Patrick's Day, at 3:30 p.m., Rev.

Briefs: Owing to the present snowstorm the apparatus of the Fire Department has once more been put on runners. The funeral of Mrs. Gronlund, wife of Mr. Gronlund, Manager of the Finland Navigation Company in this city, took place yesterday morning from the General Hospital. At a meeting of the Point St. Charles division of the Brotherhood of Engineers it was decided to have a ball and social at an early date, and a committee was appointed to make the necessary arrangements. An old woman named Mary Andaman, 77 years of age, died in the female jail on Saturday night. Yesterday morning Coroner McMahon went down and held an inquest. The jury returned a verdict that she died from natural causes. Mr. Israel Rubenstein, acting chairman of the Baron de Hirach school, has sent a letter to Rabbi Veld thanking him in the name of the committee for his great personal interest in the school and for the time he has devoted to the examination of the pupils, with the report of which they were extremely gratified. The Rabbi's opinion on the religious and Hebrew instruction is much valued. The committee feels sure that the members of the society and the supporters of the institution will be pleased to know that the school is in such a high state of efficiency. BOARD OF REVISERS: The Last Day on Which Applications Can Be Filed: When the Board of Revisers met yesterday morning, Mr. Normandin, on behalf of the East Ward Conservative organization, presented a list of 353 names at present on the provincial voters' list for that ward which he asked to have struck off on account of want of qualification. Mr. Normandin explained that a door-to-door canvass of the ward had been held and that it showed that the 353 persons in question had either never lived at the houses on which they were supposed to be qualified, or had moved long ago."

In addition to the snowploughs, the contrivance known as the Hanger did good work in clearing the track from snow.

Wheat advanced on the Board of Trade today. It then got a break of half cent or more and on the second bulge sold higher than at the opening. The cables, the consols, the foreign prospect, the statistics, were all helpful to wheat and the advance would have been less surprising had it been four times as great. The trade had enough bull news this morning to put the May price into the 80's again. The May price, which closed at 74.5c Saturday, started at 74.0c, touched 74.5c, dropped to 74.0c, firmed to 74.5c, sold to 74.5c, hardened slowly to 75.0c, and held at midday at 74.5c, a higher. The July sold 72.5c to 71.5c to 72.0c to 72.0c to 72.0c, when May touched 75.0c. The foreign figures were in the visible supply report. The steady reduction in stocks with exports too light suggests a strong situation, coupled with the absence of foreign shipments. The surprising thing is the apathy of importers. It was after 12 when the feeling became more friendly to the buying tide and price made a further slight advance, 75.0c May, 72.5c July. But there was no sign of enthusiasm; no reports of good cash sales were heard. The local trade had made its half-hearted move for the day, and the dullness which followed indicated that even the 1c to 2c gain in prices might not hold. Wheat was further advanced before the close to 75.5c May, to 72.0c July. Last prices were 75.5c, 75.0c and 72.5c. The net gain in May was 1.0c, in July 0.5c, in September 0.5c, from 70.0c Saturday to 71.0c at the close today. Chicago, March 1. There was an array of statistics on wheat today, enough to encourage the most faint-hearted bull, and yet the gain in price, owing to the slackness of trade and to the indifference of foreigners, was greatly disproportionate to the information. The world's shipments for the week 2,636,000 bushels were the smallest in years, the amount on open average decreased 1,760,000 last week, the American visible supply 1,418,000 bushels and the English visible supply, 263,000. Under ordinary circumstances the figures mentioned should have resulted in from two to three cent rise in values, but at the close of the market the net appreciation was less than a cent. Crop damage stories were received from St. Louis and other southwestern points, but they apparently had little effect on the market, Liverpool opening cables were 1d higher, closing ones giving an easier tone and a partial decline; Closing Berlin advices quoted 1/8 of a mark decline. Paris and Antwerp had no market, this being a holiday in those cities. May wheat opened from 74.5c to 74.0c; sold between 74.5c and 75.0c; closed at 75.0c to 75.5c, 1c to 2c higher than Saturday. Cash wheat was firm and 1c to 2c higher. Corn and oats each advanced 1c to 2c. Estimated receipts for tomorrow: Wheat 39 cars; corn, 405; oats, 320; hogs, 27,000. Freights Nothing doing.

LIVE STOCK MARKETS. Cables Firmer for Cattle and Prices Advance One-Quarter to One Cent, Sheep Firm-Local Trade Fairly Active at an Advance in Prices-Some Buying in the Country for Spring Shipment. London, March 1. Owing to short supplies of cattle the tone of the market was stronger and prices advanced 1c to 1.5c, as compared with last week. Trade was much firmer all round, States' cattle selling at 11.0c and Argentine at 10.0c. Sheep were firm at the advance noted last week, choice selling at 12.0c to 13.0c. A private cable received from Liverpool quoted choice Canadian cattle unchanged at 11.0c. Mail advices from our own correspondent at Liverpool, under date of February 13th, say: The wreck of the Skerries is the topic this week and affords some usual small talk about Anglomania off the coast of conversation this distraction from the bad trade. Latest advices report that a lot of the sheep have been saved, but that nearly all the cattle were drowned or smothered. This is rather extraordinary considering the easy position the vessel lay on the rocks, and the fact that comparatively calm weather prevailed since the disaster. The steamer is, of course, a constructive total loss, so the matter of insurance ought to be simplified materially. AFTER THE SNOWSTORM. We have had very mild weather, and on top of the thaw, in some places, a tremendous downpour of rain. The result is disastrous floods in many pastoral districts, with a serious mortality among ewes and lambs. The marketing of sheep from grazing centres is going on heavily, many feeders, no doubt, finding it will be impossible now to provide for the stock they were intending to carry on till April. ANOTHER PLEURO-PNEUMONIA SCARE, this time in Essex, is giving the Board of Agriculture great concern. They were so cock-sure that pleuro was ""stamped out,"" since the foreign cattle were shut out, that they really believed a good deal of what they said was true. Alas! for their blind belief, first one outbreak occurs right in the heart of London, and within a fortnight another in Essex, some forty miles from the capital. Failing American or Canadian source of contagion they, of course, ""traced"" the cattle originating the disease to Ireland and now they have got the Irish agriculturists fairly set by the ears, as it is claimed Ireland has had a clean bill of health since September 1893, for everything except swine fever and sheep scab. Anyway, the Board of Agriculture has done its duty in tracing back the disease to some other country, for it is one of the canons of the department that there is no disease in English cattle, it must be imported. The returns of the Board show that anthrax, swine fever (hog cholera), glanders and sheep scab are practically rampant in nearly every county of England, but not pleuropneumonia nor foot-and-mouth. Oh dear! Such diseases are unknown to them, and peculiarly indigenous in countries scheduled by the British Government."
"18970306","A BUMMERLESS YEAR: What an Old New Yorker’s Diary Tells of Snow and Ice in 1816 (New York Sun) The year 1816 was known throughout the United States and Europe as the coldest ever experienced by any person living. There are persons in northern New York who have been in the habit of keeping diaries for years, and it is from the pages of an old diary, begun in 1810 and kept unbroken until 1817, that the following information regarding this year without a summer has been taken. January was so cold that most persons allowed their fires to go out and did not burn wood except for cooking. There were a few cool days, but they were very few. Most of the time the air was warm and springlike. February was not cold. Some days were colder than any in January, but the weather was about the same. March, from the 1st to the 6th, was inclined to be windy. It came in like a small lion and went out like a very innocent sheep. April came in warm, but as the days grew longer the air became colder, and by the 1st of May there was a temperature like that of winter, with plenty of snow and ice. In May the young buds were frozen dead, ice formed half an inch thick on ponds and rivers, corn was killed and the cornfields were planted again and again until it became too late to raise a crop. By the last of May in this climate the trees are usually in leaf and birds and flowers are plentiful. When the last of May arrived in 1816 everything had been killed by the cold. June was the coldest month of record ever experienced in this latitude. Frost and ice were as common as buttercups usually are. Almost every green thing was killed; all fruit was destroyed. Snow fell ten inches deep in Vermont. There was a seven-inch snowfall in Maine, a three-inch fall in the interior of New York State, and the same in Massachusetts. There were only a few moderately warm days. Everybody looked, longed and waited for warm weather, but warm weather did not come. It was also dry; very little rain fell. All summer long the wind blew steadily from the north in blasts laden with snow and ice. Mothers knit socks of double thickness for their children, and made thick mittens. Planting and shivering were done together, and the farmers who worked out their taxes on the country roads wore overcoats and mittens. On June 17 there was a heavy fall of snow. A Vermont farmer sent a flock of sheep to pasture on June 16. The morning of the 17th dawned with the thermometer below the freezing point. At about 9 o'clock in the morning the owner of the sheep started to look up his flock. Before leaving home he turned to his wife and said, jokingly: ""Better start the neighbors soon; it's the middle of June and I may get lost in the snow."" An hour after he left home a terrible snowstorm came up. The snow fell thick and fast, and, as there was so much wind, the fleecy masses piled in great drifts along the windward side of the fences and outbuildings. Night came and the farmer had not been heard of. His wife became frightened and alarmed the neighborhood. All the neighbors joined the searching party. On the third day they found him. He was lying in a hollow on a side hill, with both feet frozen; he was half covered with snow, but alive. Most of the sheep were lost. A farmer near Tewksbury, Vt owned a large field of corn. He built fires around the field to keep off the frost. Nearly every night he and his men took turns in keeping up the fires and watching that the corn did not freeze. The farmer was rewarded for his tireless labors by having the only crop of corn in the region. July came in with ice and snow. On the Fourth of July ice as thick as window glass formed throughout New England, New York and in some parts of the State of Pennsylvania. Indian corn, which in some parts of the East had struggled through May and June, gave up, froze, and died. To the surprise of everybody, August proved the worst month of all. Almost every green thing in this country and Europe was blasted with frost. Snow fell at Barnet, thirty miles from London, England, on August 30. Newspapers received from England stated that 1816 would be remembered by the existing generation as the year in which there was no summer. Very little corn ripened in New England. There was great privation and thousands of persons would have perished in this country had it not been for the abundance of fish and wild game. In direct contrast with 1816 appears the year 1827-28, when there was no winter. Capt. Daniel Lyon, who died some years ago in Burlington, Vt, used to relate his experience in 1827-28. He said: ""I knew but one season when winter was almost like summer, the winter of 1827-28. I was running the steamboat Gen. Green between Burlington, Vt, and Port Kent and Pittsburgh, N.Y., and during the year there was not a bit of ice in the whole lake from one end to the other."" The old Lake Champlain Steamboat Company hauled out the steamboats Phoenix and Congress, and hardly a bit of ice appeared in Shelburne Bay, near Burlington, during the winter. ""The Phoenix had a new engine built in Albany, and the whole outfit had to be carried from that city to Shelburne Harbor by teams through the mud. At Middlebury, Vt, the mud was more than a foot deep. The Phoenix was rebuilt and ready to launch by January 15. January 18 was the day fixed for the launching, and I took a large party from Burlington on the day."" The sun was shining with warmth of a July day, and the women on deck raised their parasols. $ THE GAZETTE printed and published for the O."

Referee George Siler drove over to Corbett's yesterday, and while standing in the handball court he was collided with by one of Corbett's handball players, who was running hard to reach a ball the pugilist had just struck. Siler, who has been sick, was jolted heavily in the stomach and was supported to a house nearby, where, after treatment, he recovered somewhat, although in the evening he was attacked with a recurrence of the pain.

Birmingham, March 9 The fight between Plimmer, of England, and Sam Kelly, of New York, for 200 a side and a purse of 400, took place tonight before the Olympic Sporting Club of this city, and was won by Kelly in 20 rounds. There were a large number of spectators present to witness the fight, the hall being crowded to its fullest capacity. Both men entered the ring weighing 144 pounds each. The betting at the start was slightly in favor of the Englishman, the odds being 2 to 5. In the first round Plimmer took a strong lead. Kelly appeared to be quite slow, and he was a target for Plimmer's left. In the fourth round Plimmer punished Kelly freely, but the latter frequently missed his round right-hand swing. At the end of the tenth round Plimmer had become a strong favorite, and he was backed at 3 to 1 to win. To the end of the sixteenth round the Englishman had the best of the encounter. Kelly then fought with greater determination, and Plimmer in the eighteenth round showed that his previous exertions had tired him. Kelly had the best of this round, but, notwithstanding this, Plimmer was a strong favorite in the nineteenth round. Kelly now redoubled his efforts. Amid tremendous excitement he hustled the Englishman around the ring, gaining the upper hand. When the 20th round was half finished Kelly landed a crushing blow on his opponent's jaw. Plimmer staggered and Kelly, following up his advantage, landed another smasher on his throat, knocking him down. The Englishman rose after the lapse of nine seconds. Kelly again hit him and knocked him out ten seconds before the time of the fight would have been up. The fight of the American was a sensational one, Barney Barnato's Good Fortune. (London Figaro) It is better to be born lucky than rich. When Mr. Barnato was at Johannesburg last year he determined to go to the races. ""You'll only lose your money,"" said his friends, warningly. ""Well, I won't take any with me,"" he replied, ""and then I shall be all right."" At the racecourse he saw a man with a peanut and fruit stall, and asked him what he'd take for it. ""Two hundred pounds,"" was the reply. ""Done with you,"" said Barnato. ""Well, where's the money,"" said the man, as Barnato was proceeding to appropriate the stall. ""Oh! I'm Barnato, I'd be all right."" ""Well, that's good enough for me."" Within an hour Barnato had sold the contents of the stall for 600. He paid the man his 200, staked the balance on the racer, and won 12,000 before the end of the day. Perhaps it is not generally known how Mr. Barnato came to be married. The beginnings of his fortune are said to have been due to the prudent purchase of diamonds in South Africa. These he depicted for safety with a friend in Kimberley. After a time he said to her: ""Give me my diamonds, I'm off to Europe. When I return we'll be married."" ""I think we'll be married then,"" she replied, and those were the only terms under which he could get back his diamonds.

"18970323","H. K. A. Allan, with whom Sir Charles Tupper's Government entered into negotiations and agreed to modify the terms and conditions in certain particulars. An agreement was eventually arrived at, but in the meantime the Dominion Government had appealed to the country and had been defeated. Under these circumstances Mr. Chamberlain declined to ratify the arrangement made with the Allans, especially as by some oversight a copy of the Allan tender had not been submitted to him. The following letter from the Colonial Office to the High Commissioner for Canada, dated July 10th, 1898, sets forth Mr. Chamberlain's position with sufficient clearness: In reply to your letter of the 4th instant, respecting the fast Atlantic service, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Chamberlain to acquaint you that he is still of opinion that it would be undesirable to take any steps towards definitely accepting the tender of Messrs. Allan until the new Government of the Dominion has been formed. Independently of this consideration, however, it would in any case be impossible for Her Majesty's Government to come to an immediate decision on the matter because, as intimated in my despatch to the Earl of Aberdeen of the 21st November, 1895, Her Majesty's Government have still to consider the amount of the subsidy to be granted from the Imperial Exchequer, and for that purpose they require to be furnished with all particulars in possession of the Dominion Government, including the form of tender and copies of all tenders and of any communications in respect to them which may have been received. With reference also to your interview with Mr. Chamberlain on the 8th instant, I am to state that Mr. Chamberlain learns that some charges of an important character have been made in the tender of Messrs. Allan. If that is the case, it is quite possible that questions will arise as to the necessity of calling for fresh tenders, so that all parties may have a fair chance of competing on the altered terms. This then was the position of affairs when Mr. Laurier took office in July last. Messrs. Allan at once entered into communication with the new Government and submitted a memorandum, in which they state that their tender was accepted subject to the following conditions: 1. We are to have four months from the date of completion of the contract in which to float a company with necessary capital, and to carry through certain necessary arrangements. Should we from any unforeseen cause fail in doing so, we are to be at liberty to resign the contract without penalty. 2. With reference to the penalties provided in the Government conditions, clauses 16-19 inclusive, the contract shall provide that speed may be reduced during fog, snowstorms or heavy gales, or to avoid danger in the vicinity of ice or land, and that reduction of speed or delay in sailings due to such causes or to serious marine disasters shall not involve the contractor in penalties nor be deemed to be a breach of contract. 3. Owing to the delay which has already been incurred in completing these negotiations, the time for commencing the mail service is to be extended if required, it being understood that the contractors are to use all diligence in arranging for the construction of the steamers, but are not to be liable to penalties for any unavoidable delay. The subsidy to be paid by the Dominion Government was $150,000 a year, and by the Imperial Government $75,000, making a total of $225,000, or rather more than a million dollars. For this the Allans proposed not only to provide the mail service required, but to enlarge and improve their various cargo and passenger services, including: (1) A weekly cargo and passenger service from Liverpool to Quebec and Montreal; (2) A weekly cargo and passenger service from Glasgow to Quebec and Montreal; (3) A weekly cargo service from London to Montreal; (4) A fortnightly passenger and cargo service from Glasgow and Liverpool to St. John, N.B., and Halifax. The Laurier Government, however, took no action in the matter, and the first sign of activity on their part was Mr. Dibley's announcement of an arrangement with Mr. Fetterton for a subsidy of $500,000 from the Dominion Government and $230,000 from the Imperial Government, making $730,000 in all. The terms are on the whole very much better than the Allan tender, but it remains to be seen what we are going to get for them. The provisional contract, being the authority made under the act quoted above, is subject to the approval of the Dominion House of Commons, and cannot be carried out without the concurrence of the Imperial Government. Whether Mr. Chamberlain will still be of the opinion that fresh tenders should be called for, so as to give everybody a chance, remains to be seen. It is to be hoped that we have got to the end of the long chapter of accidents and delays in this matter, and that the Imperial Government will act promptly as soon as the Dominion Government has made up its mind. As an instance of the present Provincial Government's economy in small things, may be mentioned the stoppage of the system of printing in the friendly press a list of licenses issued, after they were issued. The practice was utterly useless. It informed the public of no fact that those interested could not ascertain for themselves at the commissioners' office. It cost a great deal. Here are the details in the Montreal district for the year 1891: Sept. 19 Herald 400 M S O 00 400 00 22 L'Impartial 400 S3 Le Prix Courant 400 00 23 La Patrie 400 00 26 Trait d'Union 403 00 26 His Majesty's 300 00 28 National 400 00 28 Moniteur du Commerce 400 00 C- Canada Review 400 00 400 00 30 Echo Printing Company 400 00 Journal of Commerce 300 00 Some of these papers are reputable journals; some of them have their names now brought to the notice of the general public for the first time. Some of them are today the most severe in condemning the Government because, they say, it is not economical. The U.S. Senate has agreed to the amendment to the Arbitration Treaty, recommended by its committee, requiring all questions submitted to arbitration under the terms of the treaty to be first sent to the Senate for approval or disapproval. The action is an important one, as affecting the President's powers not less than the working of the treaty. It elevates the Senate to a position in the Government, so far as foreign affairs are concerned, equal almost to that of the President. It is the most marked step in the efforts of the Senate to extend the power given to it by the constitution. The Senate has always had the power of rejecting a treaty after it was made, or of condemning an appointment. Now it proposes to take a hand in the making of treaties, for every arbitration, while carried out under the general treaty, will be in a way a special treaty. The United States Senate is, in its way, illustrating the process by which Parliament in England won from the Sovereign the chief power in the nation. We are so accustomed to use the term Christian for all that is good and kind, and to associate Mohammedanism with violence and cruelty, that we are apt to forget that there may be another side to the picture. Perhaps the following resolution, passed at a recent meeting of the Moslem Patriotic League in London, will serve as a reminder that the other side exists: ""That this meeting of the Moslem Patriotic League tenders, in the name of the true believers, its heartfelt thanks and congratulations to Sir Alfred Biliotti, Her Majesty's Consul-General in Crete, for his most humane, timely, and heroic action in saving the lives of more than 2,000 men, women, and children, mercilessly driven from their homes and relentlessly persecuted by their Christian fellow-subjects in Crete. Further, this meeting strongly protests against the daily massacre of innocent Moslems in Crete, and feels sure that the Moslem minority would soon be exterminated by Greece, unless the Powers of Europe, and especially England, the greatest Mohammedan Power in the world, take immediate steps to prevent the massacres and compel Greece to withdraw her troops, who are the cause of the troubles, from the island."" A new and very commendable idea for a silver wedding is that of the Marquis of Bute, who is also Provost of Rothesay and Mayor of Cardiff. To each of these Town Councils he has given a fund which will bring in about $175 a year in perpetuity, to provide some poor respectable girl with a dowry. To a poor girl about to be married this is a tidy little sum, and it is likely that many a happy couple will bless the Marquis's generosity long after he is dead and gone. Mr. O., who has been ill at Trail, and whose life was despaired of on Saturday, has rallied, and is now in a fair way to recovery. An Italian employed at the smelter named Malano Giovanni was arrested yesterday for forgery. He raised his time check from $18 to $88. The past week has seen a succession of snowstorms, and old-timers are agreed spring is longer in coming this year than any season since the camp was first discovered in 1890.

"18970326","R will try to recover the salt on the streets for use next year. Montreal, a decade or so ago, had the reputation of being anything but a cleanly city. The Montreal of today is generally entirely different and should not be obliged to suffer under that stigma when the millions which have been spent on her streets and sidewalks are taken into consideration. If the city is not what it should be, it is perhaps only fair that the fault should be laid on the proper shoulders. It would be unjust to throw the whole onus of blame on the civic authorities; a large amount of the filth which covers the highways and byways is due to the carelessness and indifference of the citizens themselves, though they may not think so. A fair example of this is seen at this time of the year when the ""beautiful"" begins to disappear from the lanes where the accumulation of filth is something terrible to contemplate, and all again due to the want of foresight in not placing the aforesaid filth in barrels or boxes for the convenience of the scavengers. All this is, however, only by the way, for, after all, the real offenders are the police authorities, and in a minor degree the Road Department. It is freely admitted that at this season of the year it is difficult to keep the streets in a fairly passable condition, but there is no excuse for the disgraceful and dangerous condition of the sidewalks. In 1904 a neat little volume, costing something in the neighborhood of $700 to prepare, called The Police Manual, was supplied to every member of the force, which he was and is supposed to mark, learn and inwardly digest. If he has done so the findings thereof are not very apparent. Take, for instance, the sections relating to the removal of snow and ice which are quoted for the edification of those not acquainted with the enactments: ""Section 301. The snow and ice accumulating on sidewalks must be removed to a depth of six inches above the sidewalk so that the same shall be uniform with that of the adjoining property."" ""Section 302. If the snow and ice have accumulated during the day they shall be removed within an hour after the storm has ceased, and, if at night, before nine a.m."" ""Section 304. The superintendent may, after the fifteenth of March, order that the sidewalks be cleared of ice and snow."" The by-law in the city charter in regard to the last section is more explicit, enacting that the chief of police, in his discretion, may at any time after the fifteenth day of March in each year, order the footpaths or sidewalks throughout the city to be cleared entirely from snow or ice, and kept clear of snow and ice from such date. Why make a limit as to date? Circumstances should govern. How these police regulations are carried out in Montreal it would be idle to dwell upon. For the last three or four days the sidewalks have borne testimony to the apathy and total disregard displayed by the guardians of the law. The police in Toronto are at all times alive to the exigencies of the times, and at no time more so than after a snowstorm. The citizens know that the sidewalks must be cleared, and the thing is done promptly. There is no difficulty in enforcing the by-laws in Toronto and there should be none here. Superintendent Hughes has issued orders to the police to notify all householders and others to comply with the law regarding the removal of snow, in addition to the usual warning in the advertising columns of the newspapers, and it now only remains for the guardians of law and order to see that the law is obeyed to the very letter. Just why there should be a necessity for waiting until the 15th of March to have the streets cleaned is not easily to be understood. Most of the snow might depart in the middle of February, and why should citizens have to climb uphill and down dale or tramp through slush because the date specified had not arrived? Again why Montrealers should have to endure such sidewalks as there were yesterday is not yet clear. They would not if the police had carried out the instructions in their manual. Montrealers, however, seem to have grown so used to such disgraceful streets that they have apparently not even energy enough left to kick. The winter's accumulation of snow and ice had disappeared from most of the principal streets by the moral suasion of the sun principally. The footpaths were comparatively clean until the snowfall of Wednesday afternoon and night. Yet all day yesterday, or until well on in the afternoon, citizens had to wade through three or four inches of soft snow, or in other places slush. Did anyone think of having this light snow removed before nine a.m., or did a policeman reprove anyone for trudging? There is no such case on record. In most cases the removal of the night's fall of snow would have left comparatively clean footing, but no one seemed to think of removing it. Whence this apathy? St. James Street from the Post Office corner to Victoria Square in the afternoon was clear, that is in comparison with the expanse of puddles and slush from Victoria Square to Bonaventure Depot. Farther than that the writer had not courage to wade. Why should not the whole length of the street have been equally clear? The ice troughs saw to it that no part of it was dry. In regard to the streets, the Road Department claims that it is striving to do the best possible with the limited means at its disposal, but what a best it is! For the past two days Mr. St. George has been taking particular pains to see that the crossings are kept clean; that is the word used, but the feed effects are neutralized by the horrible accumulation of loyal slush which flows onto the streets in a continuous stream. Although all the ice has been removed from the streets that it was possible to cart away, as the snow cannot reach the river bank on account of the dangerous condition of the ice in the river, Mr. St. George says, nevertheless, that the duty of cleaning has been nearly exhausted, and that he is powerless to do better with the means at his disposal. All of which is a sad commentary on the management of the Road Committee. It was confidently hoped that when the large sum appropriated for putting the streets in a thoroughly up-to-date condition that the citizens would never be compelled to wade ankle-deep in slush. These hopes have proved delusive, and looking the situation squarely in the face, things are going from bad to worse. The City Surveyor is powerless; he is, in fact, between the devil and the deep sea. He cannot get enough money for the absolute requirements of his department and is blamed (wrongly, of course) by the citizens, and is abused by the Council maybe, which cannot give him what he requires on account of having so much to pay on interest charges. In fact, the situation as regards the Road Department is disgraceful; the interests of the citizens, who, of course, foot the bills, are being totally ignored. Formerly Mr. St. George had a staff of street inspectors, who did good work in bringing delinquent who contravened the city's by-law to justice; now he has only two men to fulfill the duties of ten times that number. These are all matters which the Council should take up and which the electorate should ponder over while trying to dry out their feet on the fender."

On May 1st passed steamship Crown, bound to the eastward. On May 3rd, at 10:25 p.m., in lat 48 17 N and 46 0 11 W, came up to some field ice, which we skirted to the southward until daylight, when enormous quantities of both icebergs and field ice could be seen to the northward as far as the eye could reach. At 5 a.m. passed through a narrow opening in the ice into clear water. About ten miles further to the westward, again came up with what seemed an immense barrier, drifting from about N by E (true) to S by W (true). We steered 10 miles to the southward along the edge of it, and found an opening in the ice, through which we proceeded, going dead slow; we gradually picked our way for over 6 miles to the westward. At times the ice was so dense as to stop the ship's way entirely, this ice was of immense thickness, some pieces being 12 feet thick, and drifting very rapidly to the southward, would crash against the ship's side with great force. Amongst the ice were many immense icebergs, and a number of seals could be seen spotting amongst it. We were steaming through the pack from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m., when we got clear of the ice field. About 8 p.m. thick fog set in, so dense that the ship had to be stopped, as it was dangerous to proceed. On the 5th we were proceeding dead slow throughout the day, being several times in very close proximity to large icebergs. On May 6th sighted Newfoundland coast about Cape Race. Between St. Pierre and Cape Ray we had a dense snowstorm, and for several hours had to proceed dead slow. Ten miles E, 8"
"18970513","S cattle it cannot be seen why they are not equally so in the case of Canadian animals. Prince Constantino's address to the Greek troops urging them to remember that the enemy must not be allowed to make a further step into Greece is only an addition to many evidences he has given that nature did not cut him out for a soldier. His record indicates that his proclamation is rather more due to dislike to move before the Turks' advance than to a resolve to do anything desperate in order to stop it. The Kingston Whig rises to remark: The cigar and tobacco manufacturers pushed through all the stock they had to escape an increased duty on the finished product. And they were astonished to find that a duty was put upon the leaf, and that they coveted the taxation they meant to avoid. The Government caught them for once. The Whig, of course, is a Liberal paper. No one else could see anything to rejoice at in a proceeding that cripples a number of industries and throws hundreds of workers out of work. The Ontario Government is asking for a loan of $78,000 to be paid off by 40 year annuities. It is borrowing this money and creating a debt for the province so that its surplus will not be touched. A business man, as is well known, when he has a lot of money lying in the bank, always goes and borrows some more so that he will have something to pay interest on. The process makes people believe him to be rich. James Roche, the Nationalist representative of Kerry in the Imperial Parliament, is objecting to the Canadian preferential trade idea. It would be interesting to know what Canada has done that causes the Nationalist to constantly snarl at her. A good many Canadian-earned dollars have gone in the past to swell their funds. Perhaps they are annoyed that they are not getting more. In the House of Commons the other evening Mr. Tarte spoke of the clerks of the Public Works Department as ""my employees."" Liberal ministers are perhaps to be excused for thinking they own the estate just now; but it is hardly advisable to show it so plainly. The governmental departments' masters change more frequently than the men. Mr. McMullen's objection to Mr. Alfred Jury's spouting in Toronto on the Sunday car question, while he is presumably drawing pay as an immigration agent in Ireland, may not be so well justified as at first sight would seem. If Mr. Jury means to talk in Ireland as he is reported to have talked in Toronto the longer he stays at home the better. The Manitoba Government is said to be contemplating a scheme to aid in the construction of a new railroad to Duluth. The object, of course, is competition in freight rates. The province paid a good deal to the Northern Pacific for a competitive freight line to Duluth among other places. It now wants competition with the competitor. The Public Works Department is calling for tenders for the supply of coal to the public buildings at Ottawa. It is trusted that business methods, as distinguished from ""business is business"" methods will govern all concerned. Mr. Tarte has more libel suits on hand than he has time to attend to. The Ontario Conservatives had better begin preparations for their provincial campaign. Premier Hardy's promise not to dissolve the Legislature this year will hardly restrain him from taking advantage of the high water on which his partnership is presently floating in Canada. The passenger committee of the United States Trunk Line Association has decided to accept bicycles as personal baggage on the roads it controls. It looks as if the Canadian roads would be wise to follow this example and render the Casey bill unnecessary. Heavy May snowstorms in Berkshire, Lincoln and Hereford are calculated to make the Briton pause and consider whether the refrain of Kipling's tariff poem is not more fitting as a title for his own country than for Canada.

"18970611","THE RING: Maher and Sharkey Discharged, New York, June 10. Peter Maher and Tom Sharkey, the heavyweight pugilists, who were arrested last night during their fight at the Palace Athletic Club, were this morning discharged by Magistrate Cornell in the Harlem Police Court. The magistrate said that, as far as he could see, there had been no violation of the Harbor law. There was great excitement in the room this morning, and before the court opened a great crowd had gathered in the street to await the coming of the pugilists. The first to arrive was the Maher party, consisting of Peter Maher, ""Buck"" Connolly, his manager, and his seconds, Peter Lowry, Pat Scully, Jack Quinn, and Peter Barnes. James Colville, the referee, was also in the party. The crowd greeted Maher with a cheer which he acknowledged; no one was allowed to enter except those immediately interested in the case. Soon after, Sharkey and his friends, Joe Choynski, Peter McGrath, Tom Lansing, Dan Lynch, Martin Kirby, and Steve Brodie, made their appearance. They received a reception similar to that of Maher. The two pugilists did not seem to pay much attention to one another, and later they were arraigned at the bar so that their elbows touched. They did not even exchange a nod. There was, however, the slightest evidence of ill-feeling. Inspector McLaughlin was on hand by this time, and shortly before 10 o'clock the case was called. The inspector said he believed the law to have been violated by those men last night. He believed they were engaged in a genuine prize fight. There was slugging and knocking down. He believed it his duty to stop them, as the law against prize fighting was clearly violated. The inspector insisted that there was slugging, brutal pounding, and knocking down. Magistrate Cornell stated that he had read the account of the fight, and while he believed the inspector was perfectly right in arresting the men, he did not think they could be strictly held for taking part in a prize fight. Counsel for Sharkey claimed that there was no prize fight, and that the law was in no way offended. Section 458 of the Penal Code was in every respect observed. Counsel for Maher remarked that Assemblyman Horton was at the ringside himself last night, and he said the performance was perfectly legal up to the seventh round. The inspector stated that he went to the dressing rooms of the men before they entered the ring, and read the law to them and told them that there must be no slugging. He insisted again that there was to be no slugging, and that he did right in causing the arrests. Here Magistrate Cornell interposed: ""I think you did right inasmuch as the men were disorderly, but you must understand that they received much encouragement. The public had apparently expressed great interest in what they were about to do. They are big, powerful men, and presumably high-tempered. It is not to be wondered at if they lost their heads. On this ground, an arrest was warranted if they acted disorderly. I am glad they were locked up and I would have been glad had they been forced to stay all night in the jail, but I will not entertain a complaint of prize fighting against them. I think they are within the law."" Turning to Maher and Sharkey, who then stood side by side before him, Magistrate Cornell said, ""You are discharged,"" and there was a quick clearing out of the court room.

"18970717","DREARIEST ON EARTH, Traveller Bhun the Deewrt of Thibet Unfit for Human Habitation, (Indianapolis News) Recent publication of the Russian Geographical Society contains a most interesting account of explorations undertaken under its auspices by Roborovsky and Kozioff in one of the most inhospitable regions of the earth's surface, the elevated Tibetan plateau, which along the Russian mountains lines up to the northeast face of the giant snow-clad Kuen-lun. Over this region of dismal dreariness, elevated from 14,000 to 17,000 feet above sea level, man's foot is hardly ever known to pat, and even to the natives of Kashgarla it is virtually a sealed province, in fact largely covered with deposits of loess, and earth of extremely fine particles, identical with that which forms the dominant landscape feature of a large part of China, and very similar to that which makes up the ""bluffs"" of the upper and middle Mississippi valley. In this loess originate sandstorms of terrible severity, the dust being carried in such volume into the air as to cause complete darkness, objects being rendered invisible at a distance of more than ten yards. Entire forests of poplar are buried in the dust deposit, decaying and rotting in the dry mass of earth which surrounds them. In the desert which lies south of the Uzatagh, and occupies a position upward of 16,000 feet high, hardly a trace of animal life was to be found in the middle of June, almost the only form of moving creature being solitary broken down orange antelope, which approached to within a few feet of the travellers, seeming too wary to pay attention to their presence. Rain alone falls over this most inhospitable tract, and rain is seemingly unknown. In the month of June snow fell every day, evaporating immediately. On June 18, at an elevation of 11,000 feet, the thermometer marked 11 degrees Fahrenheit. Along the depression of the Cherchmdari a striking contrast is presented in the characteristics of the country, the bank of the river being overgrown with rushes, poplars and tamarisks, and harboring immense numbers of wild camels, antelope, wildcats, boars and various smaller animals. But traces of recent desolation are everywhere apparent, large tracts being marshes, strewn with the remains of freshwater mollusks, the former inhabitants of a vast lake. WAKE ALWAYS OPEN, Boats Never Cease to Traverse the Water of Lake Michigan, Milwaukee Wisconsin. Navigation on Lake Michigan is never closed. Steamers run back and forth across the lake and between the ports of the west shore of the lake during the entire winter with remarkable regularity. The first attempts at winter navigation on the trans-lake route were made by the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad Company and by the now defunct Kegelmann Transportation Company many years ago, and the success of winter ventures became established as the character of the steamers was improved and developments were made in marine engineering. Now winter navigation proceeds almost uninterruptedly, and the new car ferries steam back and forth with little regard for weather or for ice. The success of the car ferries on Lake Michigan and the car ferry which defies winter in the Straits of Mackinac is probably the cause of the announcement that negotiations are in progress looking to the construction of ice-breaking freight steamers that will enable their owners to keep them in commission on the Lake Superior and lower lake route during the winter. The report is without foundation. There is a vast difference between the navigation of Lake Michigan from one shore to the other, and along its west shore, and the navigation of the Great Lakes throughout their length and through the interlake channels. Ice breaking is expensive, and occasionally the ice floes defy the crushing power of the so-called ice breakers. One of the car ferries was recently stalled by a dock near Menominee, which defied not only the steamer, but the explosive power of dynamite. The troubles of winter navigation on the chain of lakes would occur in the interlake channels and in the canals. Owing to the clogging effects of the ice it would be almost impossible to operate canals during midwinter. Another and a very serious bar to general lake navigation in winter is the prevalence of snowstorms, during which nothing whatever can be seen. Snow is more obstructive to the sight than fog, and during a driving snowstorm it is impossible to see anything ahead, even in the daytime. Winter navigation on Lake Michigan, where they are never out of sight of land for any length of time, experience their chief annoyance from snowstorms. They manage to steam into port when snow is flying thick because of their familiarity with the route, but they occasionally get into trouble while they are wrapped in the tumultuous privacy of the storm. It does not follow by any means that because winter navigation is successful on Lake Michigan it can be made successful in the upper and lower lake service. An Old Story Re-Enacted, (That is a sad little story which came from Kentucky a few days ago, (Collier's Weekly) At Bordley, in that state, the daughter of Joseph Milton was, with some other children, at play. The game was hide and go seek. They found a trunk and got in. It was great fun. Their playmate hunted for them upstairs and down. They looked under the bed, searched the cellar, groped through every corner and pantry. When at last they found them they were dead, suffocated in that trunk, of which the lid in falling had fastened with a spring. There is mourning now in Bordley. And yet not more, perhaps, than once there was at Modena. There in the palace of the Grimaldi, the Princess Ginevra, a girl of fifteen, was married to Francesco Doria, her playmate and lover. From the bridal feast, with a jest, she vanished. Throughout the palace and its galleries all that day and all that night her husband roamed and sought her. It was by accident, fifty years later, that in clearing old lumber from a gallery her skeleton and her jewels were found. She had been hidden in a chest which, like the trunk at Bordley, happened to have a spring lock. Samuel Rogers, a forgotten poet, put the episode into blank verse, and subsequently another forgotten poet."
"18970721","FBOM CHURCH TO CHURCH The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland greets the Lambeth Conference. The following address from the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland was read at the Lambeth conference by the Archbishop of Canterbury: To the Archbishops and Bishops in Conference at Lambeth and Westminster, Most Reverend and Right Reverend Brethren, We, the ministers and elders of the Church of Scotland, now met in General Assembly, offer you our cordial greeting. We have been informed that you propose to celebrate the thirteen hundredth anniversary of the landing of St. Augustine in the Isle of Thanet, and we desire to associate ourselves with you in a devout remembrance of the great and far-reaching consequences of this most interesting event. Thus it is a significant circumstance that the arrival of Augustine in Kent occurred very near the time when St. Columba fell in sleep before the altar of the church in Iona. In the administration of His grace, God is not limited; and we cannot forget that, as illustrative of this, the noble missionaries, whom the example and spirit of Columba inspired, rendered conspicuous service in the Christianizing of England. We also recognize that you have special cause for commemorating the work of Augustine in the conversion of the King and Kingdom of Kent, inasmuch as to this work must be attributed the organization of the Church which ultimately comprehended the entire realm of England. The distinguished prelate who will preside over your deliberations is the successor, in an unbroken line, of the first Archbishop of Canterbury, and notwithstanding many diocesan and social changes, the Anglican Church, of which and of whose branches you are the chief pastors, has continuously ministered the Word and Sacraments of Christ to the English nation and to English-speaking people throughout the world. We are not called to review its history; but we can thank God with you that, if engaged from the domination of the Roman See, and reformed in doctrine and worship, it is today an inheritor of all that is great and true in the centuries which have passed since, under the direction of Gregory the First, its external constitution was sketched by Augustine. You will meet shortly after the national reorganization of the long reign of our gracious sovereign; and it gives us satisfaction to be told that some of your sessions will be held in the church house, which memorializes this reign. We trust that the new church home will be for generations to come a center of ever-widening influence and blessing. We are persuaded that, although in respect of Church government and ritual there are differences between the National Churches south and north of the Tweed, you recognize, as we do, that the unities of faith and love are both higher and deeper than all such differences. We rejoice in every evidence of the prosperity of the English Church; and we bid you heartily Godspeed in your efforts to impart a sound religious instruction to the young, to preserve inviolate the faith once delivered to the saints, to promote the well-being of the people, to impart the Gospel of Christ to the heathen; in short, to realize the ideals and aims of the Church of the Lord Jesus. As national churches in union with the state, we are partners in the responsibility of maintaining the great principle of national religion; and we hope that, in a day of trial which may be in store for the churches, we shall cooperate in rightly upholding this principle. The time in which we seek to fulfill our ministry is full of generous aspirations, but it has also grave perils. All forces for good and for evil are intense in their action. If we had much to encourage, we are conscious at the same time of much that bids us watch and pray. Most Reverend and Right Reverend Brethren: Let us remind one another that our sufficiency is of God. Let us recall the promise of our risen Lord, ""Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world."" Let us strengthen ourselves in the abundant grace and manifold gift of the Holy Ghost, that you may be wisely guided in all your deliberations; that by the Spirit of God you may have ""a right judgment in all things and evermore rejoice in His holy comfort""; that you may be blessed in your dioceses and in the discharge of all your high duty; and that the Church which looks to you as their ""Fathers in God"" may ever, under your oversight, make increase to the edifying of themselves in love is the hearty desire and prayer of your brethren in the fellowship and service of the Lord, the ministers and elders of the General Assembly. In name and by authority, Mair, D.D., Moderator. Edinburgh, May 31, 1897. In accordance with the invariable rule of the conference, no corporate answer can be returned to this address. The archbishop, however, undertook, with the warm approval of the conference, to write himself expressing warm appreciation of this mark of brotherly regard. Below is July. Denver, Col., July 20. A severe snowstorm is reported from all the higher portions in the mountain districts. Three inches is reported at Cripple Creek, Aspen and other points, and one inch at Leadville. The weather is uncomfortably cool in Denver. A tropical turtle weighing 685 pounds got astray into Chesapeake Bay a few days ago and was captured by some stout fishermen. It is 6 feet 5 inches long and 3 feet 8 inches broad. The shell is black and rather soft, like leather, and seven large urinal ridges run down the back from head to tail.

"18970921","THE KLONDIKE, The First Snowstorm of the Season Reported, San Francisco, September 20. A special to the Call from Hal Hoffman, dated Juneau, September 13, says: The first snowstorm of the season swept over the mountains last night, which is one indication that the same thing is likely to occur at any time or likely to continue indefinitely. Small boats which arrived here today from Skagway report the snow fell one and a half feet deep on Skagway trail. If this means that further progress cannot be made on that trail by the staggering thousands, and that the establishment of winter quarters must be begun quickly where not already under way, the snow will render it almost impossible to make any progress worth attempting, to say nothing of the drifts that pile up from the trails. The snowstorm may be said to stop further progress ever from both Dyea and Skagway unless some unprecedented thing as a spell of dry, calm weather comes. Already the indications begin to bear out the statement made in these dispatches four weeks ago that the trail to Klondike would be marked by collapsed tents, and the skeletons of the weary and venturesome. Washington, September 20. Secretary Alger met some time this morning, in conference with President Weare and Michael Cudahy, of the Alaska Transportation and Trading Company. They announced their intention to make every effort to get as much of the supplies at St. Michaels up the Yukon as possible, and it is expected that three more steamers can be run up before the river closes entirely to navigation. Mr. Weare reported the steamer Humboldt ready to sail from Seattle for St. Michaels next Thursday. Secretary Alger called a consultation of the bureau officers of the War Department to hasten the preparations for the equipment of the troops who are to go forward to Alaska on that vessel. Mr. Weare said that the transportation company had, for the accommodation of this force, suitable quarters, which were erected as a temporary post, and the large supply of food stores at St. Michaels would provision them. Washington, September 20. Joseph Ladue, the founder of Dawson City, and Elmer F. Botsford, who is identified with him in his interests, have arrived here tonight for consultation with Secretary Alger as to the best means to be adopted for relieving the distress that is feared will result in the Klondike gold fields the coming winter. Mr. Ladue declares that the idea of a locomotive sled on the frozen Yukon, as suggested by Secretary Alger, is impracticable as the ice is hilly in formation."

Sugar Planters Are Anxious, New Orleans, September 27. Owing to the yellow fever quarantine regulations, there is some anxiety in the sugar districts among planters as to obtaining labor to work on the fields and in the sugar houses. Most of the labor thus employed is from Mexico, and the rigidity of the quarantine regulations has made it well nigh impossible for planters to get the help they require.

"18971015","MARINE MATTERS, New White Star Liner, Belfast, October 12, The new White Star liner Cymric was launched here today at the yards of Harland & Wolff. The Cymric is a freight and passenger steamer of 12,000 tons, considerably longer than the Georgic, which is the largest of the White Star line freight steamers now in service. The White Star Line is understood to have contracted for over 100,000 tons of new steamer property. In addition to the Cymric, the Oceanic is approaching completion. The latter was to have been launched in January next, but owing to the continuance of the strike in the engineering trade of Great Britain, it is probable that she will not be launched until May or June. The Lake Superior's Trip, At 6 o'clock last evening the Beaver line steamship Lake Superior, Captain Stewart, arrived in port with passengers and a general cargo. The trip across was not altogether a pleasant one, strong westerly winds and head seas prevailing nearly the whole way across. Off Belle Isle a snowstorm was encountered. During the passage a concert was held in the cabin. Among the talent was Mr. Charles Mack, of Morton & Mack, the well-known comedy team. Mr. Mack gave several musical selections, while his songs caused great merriment. The others who contributed were Mrs. Gordon, Rev. Mr. Little, Mrs. Peolan, J. Cummings, Dr. Gray, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Capel presided, and the passengers showed their appreciation by contributing $10, which will be devoted to the Seamen's orphanage.

"18971027","Y, October 26 The most disastrous fire Hudson has had in years raged in the Union mill on Diamond St this morning. The loss will be $150,000, and five hundred men are thrown out of work. The fire started in the card room at about 11 o'clock this morning and spread to every part of the building notwithstanding the efforts of the entire fire department and the employees of the mill. The most unfortunate part is that the property was insured for only about $50,000, owing to the excessively high insurance rates in Hudson. Fortunately, no one was injured. Windsor, Ont, October 26 The residence of Charles McClearie, corner Caron Avenue and Clarke Street, was almost totally destroyed by fire last night. The fire started while Mr. and Mrs. McClearie were away from home. Cause unknown. The total damage will aggregate about $5,000; partly insured. Illustrated Postal Cards (London Telegraph) Illustrated postcards are slowly creeping into use in this country, but enterprise and art have an opportunity here of increasing and meeting a demand in this direction. Postcards with representations of interesting local scenes have long been popular on the continent with residents, and visitors readily fall into the fashion. Ornamental postcards and envelopes are constantly used by correspondents, and postcard collecting abroad is quite as common as stamp collecting was in this country some time ago. The cards are fastened in an album, especially made for the purpose, or artistically arranged in groups on walls and tables. Our illustrated postcards will probably be made more varied as the taste grows, and with art and technical schools on every hand, there is no reason why they should not lead to the establishment of a new department of industry. There is certainly no more ready or pleasing way by which a friend can give his correspondent an idea of his surroundings. Many of the great publishers are now issuing views of English cathedrals and other places of historic interest and not a few pretty landscapes. Some hotels, too, are using cards with views calculated to invite customers. But people in this country generally use the plainest paper and postcards. On the continent, the sales of these interesting little works of art are enormous, and it is stated an attempt to get one better will be made by enterprising manufacturers there who contemplate reproducing works of the old masters in miniature. Firms in London who are connected with German publishers say they sell a vast number of these ornamental postcards abroad, and that their customers greatly value them. Trouble With Indians Denver, Col, October 26 Governor Adams has received a message from deputy sheriff Frank K. Watson, at Meeker, Col, to the effect that game warden Wilcox tried to arrest some Utes on the Snake River, five miles from Lilly Park. They resisted and fired on the Wilcox party. No whites were injured, but several Indians were killed and injured. The Governor said he did not apprehend any serious trouble and would not at present order out any troops. Lilly Park, on the Bear or Yampar River, has been the scene of most of the game depredations of the Utes ever since the ""Ute War"" of ten years ago.

You know he is well known down there. A little spark, especially a spark of that kind. There is undoubtedly a strong feeling of indignation all over the country, down east especially, and the nearer you get to the cause of it the more intense it is. The indignation, moreover, is shared among Catholics themselves, as well as among the Protestants. The best class among the Catholics strongly disapprove of the Archbishop's words."" Mr. Haycock said the lady who was the cause of offense to the prelate is Miss McKeen, a Catholic.

A Dominion Trade Commissioner to Japan has arrived back from his trip. He says he has information that the Canadian Pacific will shortly run steamers weekly to Japan. Menna, October 27. The present deadlock in the Reichsrath, owing to the German obstruction, has created a critical situation, and in some quarters a suspension of the Austrian delegation is believed possible. At today's session of the lower House, after an uproarious dispute between Dr. Franmareii, the acting president of the German Opposition, the Chamber adopted by a large majority the acting president's proposal to discuss the motions for the impeachment of the Ministry at the next session, and to devote the evenings to the bill for the extension of the compromise with Hungary for a year, the delay in adopting which is causing much resentment in Hungary, and rendering the passing of the treaty by the Hungarian Parliament extremely doubtful. COLORADO'S SNOWSTORM Per the First of the Season It Did a Good Deal of Damage Denver, Colo., October 27. A blizzard which began Monday morning continued until today. During the night, the snow gradually piled up, and this morning snow stopped falling. The indications are that heavy January weather is on, and the damage foots up to $400,000. This must be added to the heavy expenses entailed upon the street railways in attempts to keep the lines open and the loss to merchants in the way of business. The streets piled high with snow present a curious spectacle. There is hardly a street in the city that has not at some point a tangle of fallen wires. Broken poles hang in mid-air or peer from big snow drifts. It is estimated that throughout the state no less than a million of wires are down. Manager of the Colorado Telephone Company stated that the damage is extensive."

There was thick fog off Green Island and the river was smoky and hazy from Quebec upwards.

Brodie reports that the Peruvian sailed on the night of the 15th inst., with 48 passengers and that dirty weather lifted nearly the whole way across. When off Belle Isle a snowstorm was encountered. The vessel was brought to an anchor off Lanorale at 7 o'clock on Wednesday night, but owing to the dense fog which prevailed the vessel was unable to proceed until 11 o'clock yesterday morning."
"18971102","J. Forget, president of Montreal Street Railway, for kindly presenting silver cups for competition at our races, and we heartily appreciate such substantial acts of kindness from our friends. The treasurer's report is a source of gratification to the committee and the club in general. The handsome balance of over $3,500 is, we think, more than satisfactory. To this amount might be added the sum of about $100 for boxes rented to the skaters, for which we do not receive credit, as this amount is credited to the general locker account of the association. Your committee would strongly recommend that the fee for the boys' tickets be raised from $1 to $2. This would keep the boys' membership within a controllable limit, and be to the best interests of our senior members. We are glad to report again that our lady membership increases annually, and as this is one of the principal secrets of our success, we hope that the fair sex will continue to patronize the rink as much as ever, for without our lady membership our rink would certainly be a failure both socially and financially. We are pleased to see that dancing on the ice continues to be enjoyed by a number of our members, and we hope that next year this will become more of the rink than in the past. The quarter-mile track was opened early in the season, and kept open throughout the winter. George Crawford, our caretaker, deserves special credit for the condition in which the ice was kept, and also for the way in which this winter's heavy snowstorms were handled, and in every particular perfect satisfaction was given. Robert Marling and the rest of the staff attended to their duties well, and deserve credit for carrying out instructions promptly and faithfully."

The Ottawa Journal of Wednesday says: Yesterday's snowstorm had a bad effect on the attendance at the recital in Bank Street Presbyterian church last night, but the programme was all that could be desired. The soprano singing of Master Freddie Ulley of St. James Methodist Church, Montreal, and the masterly playing of Mr. C. O'Brien. Only Routine Business. The heavy snowstorm which prevailed last night at Outremont evidently put a damper on the attendance at the meeting of the School Commissioners. Mr. Robison presided, the other commissioners present being Messrs. Ainslie, Hart and Denman. In addition to the commissioners, two of the residents also braved the elements, evidently with the expectation of seeing some fun; but they were disappointed, as the business transacted consisted of reading the minutes of several previous meetings and some routine matters. Before the meeting adjourned, on motion of Councillor Hart, it was decided that the secretary-treasurer be instructed to proceed against certain persons, as test cases, for the collection of the arrears of taxes, in the manner prescribed by sections 353 to 362 of the Code of Public Instruction. It was moved by Mr. Ainslie, seconded by Mr. Denman, that Mr. Hart be appointed to represent the board at the audit and examination of the books of the school on the 10th inst, as ordered by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Montreal Entomologists. The second meeting of the season of the Montreal branch of the Entomological Society of Ontario was held at the residence of Mr. Winn, 4477 St. Catherine Street, and in spite of the very bad weather there was a very fair attendance of members. Mr. Winn read a very interesting paper on the result of an entomological ramble as late in the month as the 24th of October, and exhibited specimens in illustration. He also showed, under the microscope, the eggs on the cankerworm moth. The president called the attention of the members to a notice of a new and successful moth and beetle trap, invented by Mr. O.P. Gillette of Fort Collins, Colorado, state entomologist, by which as many as two thousand moths and three thousand beetles had been taken in a single night. Mr. Winn also exhibited a portion of his large collection, and some time was pleasantly spent in examining it. City Hall Jottings. The City Clerk, according to instructions from the last meeting of the council, has given notice that the city intends to apply for certain privileges. Ald. Rainville is, as usual, opposed to any very great increase in the borrowing power of the council; but the chairman of the Road Committee holds that there are a number of greatly needed improvements of a permanent character which could not remain over for another year. The City Surveyor has given orders for the levelling of Sherbrooke Street, near Logan Park. The work will be pushed to completion before the winter sets in. The Mayor yesterday morning received and forwarded to Ottawa a sum of $50 for the relief of the Gasselman fire sufferers. The money was the proceeds of an excursion given by the French-Canadian Artisans' Society. The Hibernians Object. Division No. 1, Ancient Order of Hibernians, have completed arrangements for their entertainment in Windsor Hall on the 23rd inst, the anniversary of the execution of the ""Manchester Martyrs,"" and also for the reception of their fellow-countryman, Mr. John F. Finerty. The following resolution was unanimously carried: Whereas, certain posters of a low character have been placed on the dead walls and in the windows throughout this city, evidently with the object of insulting the Irish people generally, Be it resolved, that this body protest energetically against the continuance of such representations, and insist that the managers of theatres and other places desist from engaging actors or others whose object is to caricature Irish manhood. Ambulance Calls. Cyprien Vitzina of St. Thomas de Montmagny is at the Notre Dame Hospital. He claims that he met some persons on the wharf who, besides robbing him, gave him a severe beating.

A youth named George Walsh fell off a car at the corner of Vigor Square and Craig Street yesterday morning. He received several contusions of the leg and was treated at the Notre Dame Hospital. Owen Kelly of 70 Sangulnet Street last night, while engaged in lifting a heavy box, fell and broke his leg. He was taken to the General Hospital in the ambulance. Will Be Inspected. On Saturday afternoon there will be an inspection of the Westmount Fire and Police Departments by the mayor and council of that town. The firemen will be put through their paces in laying out hose, making couplings, etc., and the police will also undergo a similar inspection, which will, of course, apply to their uniforms and arrangement of their habiliments, as well as to their appearance on parade. It is not anticipating too much to predict that the department and all connected therewith will undergo a creditable inspection, Westmount being in this respect a model for any town in the Dominion. Catholic Sailors' Concert. Notwithstanding the snowstorm last night, there was a large gathering of citizens and seamen at the regular weekly concert held at the Catholic Sailors' Club on Common Street.

Speaking on the much discussed question of whether the Beaver steamers would take freight at Halifax besides the mails and passengers, Manager Campbell said: ""We will take all the freight offering from Nova Scotia, and also land all the freight for this port here. We have no Halifax freight on the Gallia, due tomorrow, owing to the Allan line trying to force us not to carry freight at this port in order that they would have a monopoly of the business for their Glasgow, Liverpool and St. John's line. Our undertaking is a purely Canadian one and the people of Halifax and St. John, in common, with the people of the rest of Canada, we hope will look upon it in a purely national light. The amount of freight to be carried over the Intercolonial Railway will depend on the arrangements which that road is able to make with roads terminating at Montreal.

"18971204","THE STANDRECHT INVOKED, Editors May Be Sentenced to Death or Imprisonment by Summary Trial But Little Rioting Yesterday, Vienna, December 3, Herr Kramarsh vice-president of the Reichsrath, declares that neither he nor Dr. Von Abrahamovich, its president, will resign in the face of mob intimidation. He considers, however, that it will be impossible to carry the Ausgleich (Austro-Hungarian Compromise Bill) in the Reichsrath and that the present arrangement with Hungary will have to be prolonged by Imperial decree, without the assent of the Reichsrath. This probably means the indefinite prorogation of that body and the reign of something like absolute government. The enforcement of the Standrecht (system of summary trial without appeal) at Prague speedily quieted the disturbances there. Four rioters who were arrested yesterday were tried and sentenced to twenty years penal servitude within three hours of the time of their arrest. There seems little to choose between the Germans and the Czechs. In towns where the former predominate they have committed serious excesses against the latter. In Prague, Dec. 3, the heavy snowstorm which has been continuous since last night has assisted in keeping the people quiet. The streets, cafes and theatres are almost deserted. No advertisements appear in the newspapers; trade is at a standstill, and it is feared that there will be many failures owing to the losses from rioting. Much inhumanity and brutality were exhibited during the disturbances. The windows of a children's hospital were smashed, exposing the inmates to the bitter cold, and other hospitals suffered similar treatment. Smaller riots are reported from Chrudim, Schlan, Gabions, Tetschen, and Hod, all Bohemian towns. At Pilsen yesterday evening the troops were called upon to disperse a riotous mob of several thousand youths. Some of the latter were wounded and many arrests were made. The troops were afterward recalled. Owing to an attempt to wreck the Bohemian school at Badenbach, military assistance has been asked for to quell the disturbances. At Beraum the windows of the houses occupied by Germans and military officers were broken yesterday evening and the troops subsequently occupied the streets and dispersed the mobs. Although the streets are still patrolled by the military, business is being gradually resumed. A military court has been established at the courthouse, and the local hangman, his assistants, and a priest will remain there until further orders in order to be ready to carry out death sentences, should such steps be necessary. The troops now here number 26 battalions of infantry and two squadrons of cavalry. Serious excesses are reported to have been committed at Knín, where the Fraenkel Hotel has been partly demolished. Troops have been dispatched there. Reports from various places in Bohemia, including New Jidsehow, Melník, and Krulip, tell of disturbances during the last few days, the houses of Germans and Jews being attacked by the Czechs. The Germans of Badenbach made reprisals in the neighboring Bohemian village of Kroeglitz, where a school, two inns and a shop were attacked, a number of people being injured despite the intervention of the police and postmaster. The Germans also fomented riots at Cablonx, stoning a Bohemian school. It was necessary to call out the troops to quell the disturbance."

It is said that the sturgeon fishery, which was a large and profitable industry in the Lake of the Woods, has been almost destroyed by United States fishermen.

"18971213","HUDSON'S BAY NAVIGATION It is to be regretted that the arrangements made by the Government for the Hudson's Bay expedition should have been such as to leave little hope of setting this vexed question at rest. A large sum of money has been spent, and it appears that we are as far removed as ever from a settlement. The Government officials have very properly reserved the results of their inquiries for submission to the Government, but from what has leaked out it is easy to conclude that their report will not be favorable. Unfortunately, there seems no hope of this judgment being accepted as final in Manitoba, which is more interested in the question than any other province. Mr. James Fisher, a member of the Manitoba Legislature, who went on the expedition as the representative of that province, has returned home, and his statement of the facts agrees with the particulars given by other members of the expedition. They entered the Straits on the 22nd of June and were closely beset by ice until the 10th of July. At the beginning of July, the Diana suffered severely from ice pressure, but not so much as to prevent her proceeding on her journey. On the 11th, they got clear of the pack and on the 12th passed through the Straits into Hudson's Bay. Ice was met with in subsequent passages through the Straits, but not in such quantities as to be a serious obstacle to progress. No ice to speak of was encountered after the end of July. On lapsing out of the Straits at the end of October, there was no ice whatever, but heavy weather and the prevalence of severe snowstorms, coupled with frost and the accumulation of ice on the ship, induced Commander Wakeham to leave a few days earlier than he had originally intended. This is the substance of what Mr. Fisher has said, and it seems to be a plain statement of the facts, without bias in either direction. But it has not given satisfaction to the people of Manitoba. The Nor'-Wester finds in it sufficient ground for the inference that Mr. Fisher is too closely in touch with influences that desire an unfavorable report for the ultimate publication of his opinions to be looked forward to with confidence by the people of Manitoba, whose interests he was supposed to be representing. The article proceeds to make it very clear that even if Mr. Fisher's report is adverse, it will not be accepted as final, not so much on account of any alleged bias on his part, as on account of the conditions under which the test was made. A good many objections are offered, some of them, in our opinion, not very well grounded. First of all, the time of the expedition is objected to; it arrived at Hudson's Straits a month too late and left a month too soon! Seeing that for two days after June 23rd, the Diana vainly tried to find a way through the ice, and then entered the pack and drifted along with it till July 11th, when they succeeded in getting clear, it seems as if the expedition had arrived at Hudson's Straits quite early enough. There is, however, some force in the remark that the possibilities of navigation in the autumn are infinitely more important to Manitoba than an early spring opening. On this point, the conclusions of the expedition are bound to be unsatisfactory. All that can be said is that there was no ice on October 30th, when the expedition left, and the Manitoba people will be sure to argue, as the Nor'-Wester indeed does argue, that they ought to have stayed at least a month longer. Some observers have reported the end of November or the beginning of December as the time when the Straits were closed by ice. Whether they are navigable during this period is the question the Diana went to decide and has left unsettled, for she left, not on account of ice, but of rough weather. This gives the Nor'-Wester an excuse for attacking, not only the character of the vessel employed, but the personnel of the expedition. On both these points, there is likely to be a great deal of discussion, and it is best to let the Nor'-Wester speak for itself: ""The proper object of the expedition was not to find ice, to seek for geological specimens, or to plant flags; but to solve the question of navigation. To do this, a vessel of the class required for commercial navigation in such waters should have been selected, instead of a little sealer of 231 tons burthen and 70 horse power. At the time the Diana was chartered, the Government had under offer a vessel of 2,000 tons and 1,000 horse-power that had been constructed for Arctic navigation, where ice is as plentiful, early and late in the season, as in Hudson's Bay and Straits. This vessel could have been chartered for 700 per month, well-found in every respect, with a crew of forty men at owner's risk. She could have taken 50 passengers, if required, and many would have taken the trip to satisfy themselves of the correctness of the conclusions reached by the Government's representatives. Men would have gone who were competent to judge, having previous experience of hardships, and not mere featherbed sailors, who might be terrified out of their wits by a capful of wind. But the Dominion Government did not want too much publicity! So a small and inconvenient sealer was selected, and but one man not actually dependent upon the Government for his daily bread was allowed to accompany it. The rough weather the Diana encountered during the last week of her stay would have been child's play to a vessel of 8,000 tons burthen, whose average trip through the Straits would not last longer than 48 hours, and who, after leaving Cape Chidley, would be fit to breast the broad Atlantic for 2,000 miles. The Diana is a mere cock-boat compared to such a vessel, and seas that could wash the decks of the Diana would hardly reach the hawse-holes of the larger vessel. Therefore, for practical purposes, the trip of the Diana has been worthless, and she has not even done what she could have done with safety, waited until navigation closed. The reflections on the gentlemen who composed the expedition are entirely without justification. Commander Wakeham is not without experience of storms or ice navigation, and it would have been difficult to select a more suitable man for the expedition. His subordinates were also men of experience, in whom the Government had every reason to place confidence. The suggestion that a more trustworthy report could be given by private individuals is absurd. The Government was making the investigation, and it was bound to employ its own officials who would be unfitted for their positions if they could not be trusted to report accurately on the facts. But as to the character of the ship, the Nor'-Wester has perhaps succeeded in scoring a point against the Government. No doubt Sir Louis Davies took the best advice before chartering the Diana and will be able to make a good case out in his own defense; but the fact that the ship was unable to arrive at any conclusion as to the close of navigation is a big point against him, and the representatives of Manitoba may be trusted to make the most of it. Instead of being at the end of this long controversy, we have only made a new beginning."

"18980103","S January 5, Purtton, details of the disaster to the Thomson line steamer Gerona, which struck the rocks off Seal Island early yesterday morning, are still quite meager. The fate of Captain Baxter and the thirty crew men who headed for Seal Island in two boats after the ship was abandoned is in doubt yet, but there seems to be little hope that the Gerona is afloat as dead cattle and hay are washing ashore on the coast of Shelburne County. The lighthouse keeper at Cape Sable reports that besides a quantity of hay and the bodies of some cattle, the wreckage of a lifeboat has come ashore there; whether this was one of the boats in which a part of the crew left the Gerona cannot at present be determined. The boat cast on the beach was badly shattered. Reports from Clark's Harbor state that dead cattle are drifting in there. These reports would indicate that the steamer foundered after the crew left her, though it may be that she is still afloat and that the cattle and fodder were swept off by the high seas washing over the abandoned vessel. Second officer Alfred Watson of the Gerona, who landed at Wood's Harbor yesterday with twenty-two of the crew, thinks that the other two boats, in one of which was Capt. Baxter, had a fair chance of reaching Seal Island, but he is very anxious about their safety. He and his companions had a desperate experience in the boat in which they left the steamer, as a fierce storm was raging. The morning was inky black, and for a time they were unable to tell whither they were steering; it was not until after daylight that they could tell which direction to take in order to reach land, and it was eight hours after leaving the wreck before they pulled up on the beach, terribly exhausted and suffering frightfully from exposure to the winter elements. No word reached the mainland today from Seal Island that the missing boats had been heard from, but there has been no communication with the island the past two days. Vessels are putting out from Clark's Harbor bound to the scene of the wreck. No time has been lost in Halifax in sending steamers to the scene. The Government steamer, Newfield, engaged in the marine and fisheries service, and the big steamer Ulunda, both got away early this morning, and would reach the neighborhood of Seal Island tonight. They will keep a watch for the two missing lifeboats, and if the Gerona herself is still above water, one of them is pretty sure to come across her. The abandoned steamer would be a rich prize as she had a large general cargo besides the livestock, but the probability of her being above water is now very slim. When the crew took to the boats, the water was rushing in below, the fires were out, and she was altogether unmanageable. Later, a special received late tonight from Barrington reports the safe arrival of the two missing boats with their crews at Seal Island. They reached there some time yesterday or last night and have started for Tarmouth on a small steamer. One sailor named Carl, who was supposed to leave the ship in the lifeboat which reached Woods' Harbor, is missing and is thought to have been drowned in attempting to get away from the steamer. Most of the men in this boat, which was in charge of the second officer Watson, were cattlemen. The others with Watson were: Steward McKenzie, First Carpenter McCathner, Second Carpenter Driscoll, mess-room steward Bell, seaman Sclint, and White. About two hundred and fifty bales of hay have drifted ashore at Bon Portage Island. Cattle and hay were on the first deck, and these coming ashore is not conclusive proof that the steamer has broken up. The crew will be sent to Boston early this week. The steamer Halifax, which arrives tonight from Boston, reports passing the steamers Ulunda and Newfield between Lockport and Liverpool on their way to the scene of the wreck. The Ulunda was passed at noon and the Newfield at 1:30 p.m. The Gerona's cargo is estimated to have been worth about $210,000, including the livestock, and the steamer is valued at $150,000. The cargo was mostly insured through Montreal agencies. It consisted of 224 cattle and 50 horses, grain, flour, cheese, and pulp. A dispatch received late tonight from Tarmouth reports the arrival there of Capt. Baxter and part of his crew, while another party has been taken to Pubnico. Capt. Baxter, it is stated, believes that Blonde Rock was the scene of the disaster. Last winter, the big freight steamer Assays was wrecked there, backing off and sinking in deep water, and the captain of the Gerona thinks his ship may have struck the sunken wreck. After taking to the boats, his party laid by till morning in a heavy snowstorm and bitter cold, fearing to attempt a landing in the surf. The steamer was to be seen after daylight, and Captain Baxter believes she sank. The crew abandoned the Gerona hurriedly and saved nothing. The Gerona's cargo: Mr. Robert Reford, of the firm of Robert Reford & Company, agents for the Donaldson line in Montreal, was questioned last evening in regard to the Gerona's cargo. He could give but a rough draft of the cargo, the definite information not being available at his residence. The value of the cargo he placed at about a quarter of a million dollars. The cargo was, as far as he recollected, as follows: About 8,000 pounds rye, 10,300 bushels oats, 143 kegs radiators, 200 barrels armies, 200 cases canned goods, 427 boxes asbestos, 134 boxes meat, 16,700 bundles snooks, 1,174 pieces deals, 218 pieces wren, 9 boxes cheese, 435 boxes butter, 51 cases hats, 1 do clothing, 609 sacks peas, 8,800 sacks flour, 70,000 bushels oats, 42,600 bushels corn, 90 boxes meat, 300 cattle, 51 horses. Mr. Reford thought there were some sixty men on board, consisting of the crew and the cattlemen. A number of the cattlemen on board were undoubtedly Montrealers. The names of only two could be secured last night. They are John Williamson, of 106 1/2 Albert Street, and George Williamson, a relation. Mr. Williamson was taking over a shipment of nineteen horses."
"18980107","OLD HISTORY RECALLED An Interesting Paper on an Event in Old Canadian History (Toronto Mail and Empire) The flags were hoisted on the schoolhouses of Quebec yesterday in commemoration of the repulse of General Montgomery and Arnold's assault on Quebec, on the 21st December, 1775; but as the schools are closed for the holidays, the historical lessons always given on such anniversaries are deferred until the classes reopen. A retrospect of the subject will be appropriate in reminding Canadians of the importance of that defeat, for had it been otherwise, the map of North America would surely have been further changed, seeing that Quebec was then the key of Canada, even as it is now in every sense of the word. But it looks as if the Government is not sufficiently alive to that fact or Quebec's defences would be in a more efficient state than they are at present. However, indications point that Imperial forces are working to put our house in order against the evil day that may be nearer than we expect. One hundred and twenty-two years ago the troops of Congress held Montreal, Sorel, and Three Rivers. Sir Guy Carleton, who was in Montreal, knowing the importance of Quebec, and that for divers reasons Montreal could not be defended, destroyed the Government stores, and started with several schooners to descend the St. Lawrence, but becoming becalmed, he took a canoe, and being paddled in the dead of the night past the Continental batteries at Sorel, arrived at Quebec on the 14th November, where Colonel MacLean, who had preceded him, was preparing for its defence. Carleton at once issued an order that ""the suspected, and all who are unwilling to take up arms in its defence, must leave the town within four days."" This cleared the place of foreigners and traitors. There were only 309 British regulars in garrison, but together with the crews of two small war vessels, and several merchantmen that happened to be in port, and the inhabitants who willingly enrolled themselves, raised the force at Carleton's disposal to about 1,000 men. The defences were strengthened, and barricades erected and armed in the lower town in Sault-au-Matelot street, and also at Pres-de-ville, where is now the Allan Steamship Company property. Benedict Arnold with 80 men appeared, via the Kennebec trail, on the Heights of Levis, on the 8th November, and crossing the St. Lawrence in some canoes he had obtained on his march, camped at Sillery, made a demonstration on the Plains of Abraham, was fired on, and retired to Pointe-au-Tremble, where he awaited the arrival of Montgomery's army, which turned up on the 1st December, raising the force to some 2,080 men. These proceeded to take possession of it, erected batteries on the high ground commanding St. John and St. Louis gates. The town was well provisioned for the winter, for Carleton, profiting by Murray's experience, would run no risks, and the blockade began, varied by a considerable amount of daily bombardment and shooting at our sentries. Montgomery, finding his guns did little damage, resolved to storm the town by night, which decision was reported to Carleton by a prisoner, who escaped from the besiegers. Major Morris, one of the besiegers, wrote in his diary on the 31st of December: ""The troops assembled at two o'clock this morning; those that were to make the attack by the way of Cape Diamond collected at the general quarters upon the Heights of Abraham, and were headed by Gen. Montgomery. Those that were to make the attack by the suburbs of St. Roch's were headed by Colonel Arnold, and were two battalions that were detached from the army at Cambridge. Colonel Livingston with a regiment of Canadians, and Major Brown, with a regiment from Boston, were to make the false attack upon the walls southward of St. John's gate, and in the meantime to set fire to the gate with combustibles prepared for that purpose."" The plan was that Montgomery and Arnold were to meet at the foot of Mountain Hill and then storm the upper town. A heavy northeast snowstorm was raging at four o'clock that dark morning when Montgomery had descended the cliff and advanced by the beach path, now Champlain street, to the Pres-de-ville barricade, when the column halted about fifty yards therefrom and an officer advanced to reconnoitre. On his return the advance continued about twenty yards, when the guns of the battery suddenly blazed out grape and canister, which killed Montgomery, his aide-de-camp, Macpherson, Captain Cheesman, and ten men. The rest of the column, some 700 strong, turned and fled precipitately, the cannon and musketry accelerating their pace. Arnold's column penetrated into the Sault-au-Matelot street barricades, near where the Quebec Bank now stands, and while there heavily engaged, was taken in the rear by a detachment from the Palace gate, and 426 officers and men forced to surrender, and over one hundred men killed. Arnold was wounded, but escaped. The British loss was about a dozen killed and wounded. A party under Captain Campbell made a sortie to St. Roch's taking the five mortar and Royals which he brought into town. The attempt on St. John's gate was also a failure, and by eight o'clock all was quiet. Mr. James Thompson, overseer of works, who has left us a large manuscript diary, visited the Pres-de-ville barricade and had the frozen bodies of Montgomery and his men dug out of the snow, and they were afterwards buried in the gorge of the St. Louis bastion, where they still remain; except that of Montgomery, which, after being identified by Mr. Thompson, who had conducted the burial, was removed by the general's nephew, Mr. Lewis, in 1818, by the permission of the Canadian authorities. On finding the bodies, Mr. Thompson took Montgomery's sword, which was retained in his family until it was purchased by His Excellency the Governor-General the Marquis of Lorne, and it is now in the possession of Montgomery's family, the Livingstons, on the bank of the Hudson River. General Wooster took command, and the besiegers were reinforced to over their original strength, but no further assaults were made; batteries were erected at Levis, which did little damage, and the blockade lasted until the arrival of a British man-of-war on the 6th of May, 1778, when the garrison, thus reinforced, at once made a sortie, only to find that the birds had flown in confusion, leaving their tents, artillery, ammunition, and baggage behind in their camp. Carleton, on the arrival of more vessels and troops, advanced to Montreal, and in a short time Canadian soil was free from the marauders. The date of the assault on Quebec has been a moot subject, but certain verses taken from the Quebec Gazette of 15th and 22nd August, 1776, pretty well settle that question. In the issue of August 15, 1776, the poet has written: ""On the rebels attempting to storm Quebec between four and six o'clock on the morning of the 31st of December, 1775,"" and the issue of August 26 contains ""A song, written the 1st of January, 1778, the day after the attack on Quebec by the rebels."""
"18980108","B, January 7 (Special) The Donaldson liner Alcides arrived this morning from Glasgow. She had fine weather to Cape Race, when she ran into a snowstorm. The balance of the voyage was made in fair weather. The Alcides brought a large cargo of general merchandise for St. John and western points. The Allan-Thomson steamer Cheronea took away a cargo, valued at over $182,000, the most valuable from St. John so far this season. The net earnings of the St. John pilots last year were $20,180, divided among 29 pilots very irregularly, the highest getting $1,606 and the lowest $133. They handled 690 vessels, of which 236 were foreign."
"18980124","ON RAILROAD LINES Surprisingly Little Difficulty in the Handling of Trains - The storm, strange to say, did not to a great extent affect railway traffic. It appeared to have been confined to Eastern Ontario, Quebec, and a section of the Maritime Provinces. In conversation with passengers who happened to reach the city, there was some astonishment expressed at the blockade. The Canada Atlantic train which left the Capital at 8 o'clock yesterday morning was the first to strike a snag and it wasn't the beautiful either. At St. Dominique a snow plough left the track, and for three long hours the belated passengers waited the arrival of the wrecking train. That the storm was confined to a limited area was demonstrated in the fact that the Delaware & Hudson train, due at 7:30, was only two hours and a half late, and the detention was at St. Johns. This was also further accentuated by the non-arrival of the Halifax express, due at 6:50, but which was six hours late, owing to the storm in the eastern part of the province. According to despatches received at headquarters last evening the blizzard seemed to be raging in all its force in a westerly direction. The No. 1 Western over the Grand Trunk system was stalled at Cornwall and the indications were that if there was not a moderation in the elements there would be a harrowing tale to tell as far as the passengers were concerned. The majority of those lucky ones who succeeded in reaching the city last evening expressed more or less surprise at the mountains of snow which met their gaze. The trains, as before stated, made good time. The drifts, according to the stories of some of the passengers, were the deepest in many years and but for the admirable manner in which the trouble was tackled by the executive of the road, would have caused them no little inconvenience. WORK OF THE STREET RAILROAD Most of the Lines Kept Open by Dint of such Hard Work. Citizens have often asked themselves when they have read of blizzards and snow storms occurring in different parts of the country what would the Montreal Street Railway do under similar circumstances. The company work speaks for itself. Yesterday they had a snowstorm all to themselves, for fortunately the day being the Sabbath, there was very little vehicular traffic and the snow ploughs and sweepers were enabled to precede the cars and throw the snow on each side with impunity. In many parts of the city the snow on each side of the tracks was piled up to a height of four feet. As soon as the roadmasters on duty at night found that there were indications of a storm, they notified the workshops and within a few minutes gangs of men were placed on the sweepers and they were sent to all parts of the city. Superintendent McDonagh was nearly on the scene and he set out extra cars in order to keep the rails from freezing. A continuous service was kept to all parts of the city and with the exception of points where there is a steep grade, the service remained uninterrupted. At points where a car got stuck for a few minutes it was helped out of its predicament either by a snow sweeper or by the aid of another electric car. This was particularly the case on Windsor street, Park Avenue, Amherst and St. Denis streets. The Point service was not interfered with, the roadmaster having a large gang of men keeping the tracks clear until the space between the sidewalk and the track got jammed. This is one of the street railway's drawbacks on this line, as on Wellington street the sidewalk is boarded up and as the sidewalk is close to the track as soon as the sweeper passed along the sidewalk was conspicuous by its absence. The men however, by hard work succeeded in keeping a better sidewalk in this locality than in many streets where the cars do not run. At Westmount, the company kept one line clear around the belt. The cars went up Greene Avenue and returned to the city by the way of the Glen. If Westmount could have procured sufficient force of men both lines would have been operated. Pedestrians going to and from the churches and other places found it more convenient to walk on the car track than on the sidewalks. This had its disadvantages to both the pedestrian and motorman, for while the latter was necessarily compelled to run at a slow rate of speed on this account, many pedestrians waited until the car was within a length or so of them and then they made frantic efforts to jump aside. Some of these people in their endeavor to perform acrobatic feats made themselves look very grotesque, especially when they came out of a four feet drift. The cars were also delayed at different parts of the city by carters getting onto the tracks and their horses being unable to get up to the snow road, they continued their way unmolested until a street corner was reached. One gentleman of the West End who was suddenly called to another part of the city to go on duty was afraid that he would not be on time as there were no cars in sight. Seeing a friendly milkman making a frantic effort to bring his milk into the city the gentleman made a bargain with the driver to take him for 60 cents. They had not proceeded more than three blocks when the sweeper came along followed by a passenger car. The gentleman, however, did not care to take chances, and stuck to the milk cart, with the result that he was not marked late. The Street Railway shops on Cote street last night presented an animated scene, hundreds of men receiving shovels to work in all parts of the city. The work was continued all night, and with the aid of the gangs employed by the city, the company's officials believe they will have the road clear for vehicular traffic today. To facilitate this, the sweepers and extra cars were running all night. The Park & Island railway service was demoralized. Trip Rack river and Outremont cars did not come into the city for the day, and the Lachine cars were unable to make more than a few trips on account of the storm."
"18980125","MUST CLEAN THE SIDEWALKS, City Regulations and By-Laws on This Subject - In the Railroad Station, If the sidewalks of the city at the present time are any criterion, the city attorneys will be kept pretty busy during the spring of the year. For several years past the council has argued the question of damages claimed by those citizens who have sustained injuries through having the misfortune to fall on slippery sidewalks, and with few exceptions the verdict has been against the city. After the severe snowfall on Sunday it was to be expected that the roads would not be in good condition, but owing to the lack of energy on the part of the citizens who were naturally unprepared, the sidewalks were much worse. None of the candidates seeking aldermanic honors can claim that their ward is exemplary in this respect, for the streets, outside of the principal business ones, are in a disgraceful state, both as regards pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Many householders, while willing to comply with the law, are unfortunately ignorant as to the time when snow should be thrown off the roof. This was especially noticeable yesterday afternoon, when many passersby were the victims of having shovels of snow thrown upon them. Occasionally the pedestrian was fortunate enough to dodge, but he quickly realized his danger when he heard the dull heavy thud on the sidewalk. As it is probable, not to speak of the necessity, that several householders will be employing labor in lieu of themselves to clean the snow off the roofs, the appended section of the by-law will be interesting, as in default of carrying out the same, they stand the chance of being fined $10, or with the alternative of two calendar months' imprisonment. No person owning or having under his charge any house, part of any house, storehouse or part of any storehouse, building, or part of any building in this city, shall allow snow to be accumulated or ice to be formed on the roof of such houses, or buildings, or any part thereof, in such a manner as to subject the passers-by to any danger, under the penalty provided. The snow or ice accumulated or formed on the said roofs as aforesaid shall be removed or thrown down by the party or parties having charge of such houses and buildings before the hour of nine o'clock in the forenoon; and proper means shall be taken by such party or parties, in each case, to warn passers-by in the streets of the fact, under the penalty provided. Mayor-elect Prefontalnia, who appeared before the Finance Committee yesterday afternoon, evidently felt the responsibility of his position as chairman of the roads. He made an earnest appeal for funds to carry on the removal of snow from streets which did not have street railway lines throughout the city. As there was not a quorum, Aid. Prefontalne's appeal was in vain. Aid. Connaughton on being spoken to by the Mayor-elect, replied, ""The clearing of snow is a matter of necessity and the sooner it is cleared the better it will be for all concerned."" In light of the cry of the Finance Committee that there were no funds to keep the streets and sidewalks in good order, the City Surveyor communicated with the Chief of Police asking his cooperation in making the citizens do their legitimate share. This appeal has resulted in Police Chief Hughes issuing the following official notice to the officers and men: ""Hereafter the men will be responsible for the proper care of the sidewalks on their respective beats. Any infraction of the by-law must be immediately reported to the officer in charge of the various stations."" Aid. Radler in reply to The Gazette said that there was only one thing to be done and that was that the by-laws should be recognized and obeyed by the citizens, and that if the police carried out their instructions the Finance Committee would have no reason to complain of funds. A tour of the city last night showed the effects of the storm and with the cry of ""no funds"" from the finance it will no doubt make a palatable subject for the municipal candidates to tell their constituents how they will deal with unforeseen snowstorms should they be elected. In the several railway yards of the city numbers of men were employed yesterday clearing away the accumulations of Sunday's snowstorm. Every inch of space in the yards is wanted for the purposes of handling the traffic, and in such spots there is no accommodation for snow banks. The operation of clearing away, however, is with the railways, a comparatively easy time. They simply shunt as many box cars as they require into convenient positions, load and haul them to the nearest trestle and dump them there. Yesterday, whole train loads of snow might have been seen moving out of the yards to be thus disposed of. A great many people seemed to think yesterday in looking at the tremendous piles of snow on either side of the roads that Sunday's storm was the greatest in twenty years. The records at McGill show that this is by no means correct, although the storm was important in more than one respect, for instance the average was very high, that is it was equivalent to a large downfall of rain. The 21.6 inches of snow which fell was equivalent to 1.67 inches of water, a high average. It will be interesting to look back for some twenty years, even to 1876 and notice the severe storms that have occurred in those years. On March 21st, 1876, snow fell to the depth of 17.6 inches in one day. Following this up we have the following record: January 4th, 1878, 16.6 inches; January 2nd, 1884, 16.4 inches; December 27th, 1887, 16.1 inches; January 4th, 1887, 12.5 inches; in this latter storm it is remarkable that it continued the following day and in some 25 hours no less than 20.2 inches of snow fell; December 27th, 1887, 16.1 inches; this is also remarkable in a way for it is very unusual to have such a storm in that month. January 21st, 1889, 18.5 inches; in this case it is interesting to note that the average was a very small one, the 18.8 inches of snow being equivalent to but 0.22 inches of water. February 8th, 1895, 18.0 inches; March 19th, 1898, 14.5 inches; this storm was also marked by a high average for it was equivalent to 1.6 inches of water. This was the last very severe snowfall up to last Sunday."
"18980126","ON THE ICE, SPECIAL MATINEE FOR THIS AFTERNOON, Two good races are down on the card for this afternoon at Jacques Wartler track. The snowstorm has not interfered with the energy of the management, and although there was nearly two feet of snow, the track yesterday afternoon was as clean as a thistle, twenty teams being kept working night and day. It was a splendid bit of enterprise, for the difficulties would have discouraged most people. Those however, who go to the matinee this afternoon can judge for themselves. The entry list is an interesting one, the programme opening with a special for which there are the following entries: Romella, Skylight, Molliss, Druggist Boy, St. Cunegond Boy, Luc-Gee, Coal Girl, Miss K. The second special race has a whole lot of good ones, as will be seen from the following list: Little Puss, Olmwood Prince, Cartlerville Girl, or Mollie O, Leontes, Pea Picker. PEDLAR BRAND, Robcbv Dalomhii, 22 St. Joh Bthkkt, Montreal, Agent. Present stagnation, but we know that traders had under off lots of 1,000 boxes finest Ontario colored fall cheese at 8 1-4e, and hesitated to close even at this price, while Quebec white cheese was offered at 80. Ontario white goods are held very firm, but with buyers in their present temper 8 1-2 is an extreme bid. Private cables to shippers here state that there have been offers in England at 40s which would not allow the payment of 8 1-4c in Montreal. These offers are, of course, purely speculative, being made in the expectation that the price will decline so that they can be filled at a profit. It is not specified, however, that any large quantities have been sold at this basis, but the mere offer of these low prices in themselves will contribute to check demand. The controversy still continues regarding the stocks of cheese in Montreal. Operators who have made investigations state that they cannot exceed 150,000, while others have no hesitation in scouting this estimate, stating that they know of individual lines of over 30,000 boxes. The butter market continues heavy, with only the merest hand-to-mouth business doing. Sellers who tried to sell finest creamery at 18 1-2c found buyers scarce, and we heard of consignments from factorymen that could be had for less money. Western dairy rolls are heavy at 14c. Under grades are a slow sale for all sorts in view of the general heaviness. BONSECOUR MARKET Trade Generally Quiet - Attendance Small Prices Unchanged. The attendance of farmers and gardeners at Bonsecours market this morning was small, which was no doubt due to the fact that the recent heavy snowstorm put the country roads in such a condition that it was not safe to start with a heavy load, consequently the offerings were limited, but, as the gathering of buyers was also slim, there were ample supplies to fill all requirements, and the market on the whole had an exceedingly quiet appearance with no special feature of note, as values for all lines were without change."

"18980128","CANADIAN TRADE Late Heavy Snowstorm Did Not Affect Business Much Toronto, January 27 Dun & Co's weekly statement of trade in Canada says: While the late very heavy snowstorm, the heaviest for quite a number of years, has to some extent impeded business in the Montreal district, the Ottawa valley and northern points, its effects are not as widespread as first imagined, and the general volume of trade is fairly maintained at the level noted the past fortnight. Some of the larger dry goods houses report good orders and there is an evident disposition to buy more freely than for several years past. The unexpected advance in woollen underwear has taken the shape of a shortening of the credit terms. All woollen manufacturers are well employed and dealers in raw wools say that orders are better than they have received for three or four years. Wholesale trading in sugars and teas is of quite moderate character and in the former line there is a tendency to weakness, but teas are all steadily held and the New York market for mediums and low grades is firm. Cable advices regarding the annual sales of American raw furs now going on in London show a pretty general advance on last year's figures, though the advance is not up to the expectations formed by some dealers. The improvement in values has been pretty well calculated in the prices that have been paid for raw furs this winter and no further advance in local quotations is expected. Rails remain rather quiet, but domestic bar iron has slightly advanced. In other lines there is nothing specially new, and the money market is wholly unsaturated. There is some improvement reported this week in general wholesale trade at Toronto. The most seasonable weather has stimulated the demand for heavy wear and prices of the leading staples rule firm. Manufacturers have large orders on hand, which will keep increased demand extending to almost all departments: dry goods, hardware, groceries, leather, etc., and merchants generally have the disposition to cut prices not being so apparent. Quite a number of small failures have occurred this week, but the comparison is favorable with former years. The railways are still doing a big business in dividends, and prices of securities have advanced. For the third week of January, the gross earnings of the Grand Trunk were $448,851, an increase of $48,584 as compared with the corresponding week of last year. The Canadian Pacific earnings for the same week were $396,000, an increase of $11,000. Large exports of farm produce continue and the result is low rates of exchange, with an easy money market. Another advance has taken place in wheat, which is in good demand and coarse grains are higher. Prices of dressed hogs also show an advance. Money on call is easy at 4 per cent and prime commercial paper is discounted at 6 per cent. Within a few days the London money market is higher at 2 to 2 1/2 per cent on call, and open market discount rates 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 per cent. The failures for the week were 40, as against 67 for the same week of last year."

The storm was the most severe this city has experienced in 25 years, causing the loss of several lives, besides doing damages estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Between one and five o'clock this morning a foot of heavy, wet snow settled over the city, and leveled wires in all quarters. The snow stuck to the poles and wires with a remarkable tenacity, and aided by a wind blowing at the rate of fifty miles an hour, all telephone and telegraph lines in the city were prostrated. Over half the electric lights of the city went out, and in suburban towns the fire alarm service was badly crippled. In Newton, broken wires falling across others started a fire in the electrical room of the elegant residence of Chas. THE UPPER PROVINCES Montreal Appears to Have Got Off Lightly Nearly all trains reaching Montreal were more or less interfered with by snow blockades yesterday. This the railway men attributed more to the high winds which accompanied the storm than the snowstorm itself. It was the piling of the snow into cuttings, and in spots where the wind got a good chance to operate on, that caused the blockades, and this was more due to the snow which fell on Sunday week than to the storm of yesterday. The railways labored under considerable difficulty, too, in handling the trade in the yards. The wind having banked the snow up in places over the sidings, it was necessary to shovel the tracks clear, to get at cars which were wanted for immediate use. The superintendents of the several divisions within the storm radius were working in some cases all the preceding night to keep the yards in a condition to allow the railway traffic to go on. Trains coming in through the New England States seemed to suffer the worst, and some of these lines were almost impassable. The Boston train, due about o'clock in the morning, was obliged to make a halting run Montrealwards, and her arrival was not looked for until a late hour last night. In the State of Vermont, the storm was raging fiercely, and the snowbanks, which had accumulated into solidly packed drifts at intervals along the track, caused the trains frequent stoppages.

"18980203","QUESTIONS WITHOUT END Travelling Public Has Apparently Great Belief in His Omniscience The interruption in the railway services during Monday's snowstorm aroused the inquisitiveness of depot visitors to an unusual pitch. This is saying a good deal, for judging by the reports of station officials whose duty lies in giving information to the public, the volume of enquiries which they are called upon to answer is never insignificant. Now a railway man, particularly one who is posted to convey oral intelligence offhand to hurried questioners, is naturally expected to possess a well-informed mind on matters appertaining to the arrival and departure of trains and the geography of railway stations. Perhaps it is but natural to consider that his memory should be stocked with most of the items of intelligence in the railway almanac; but it is certain that even if he possessed the divination of a Daniel, even were he a prophet, his mental machinery must perspire under many of the exhausting drains to which it is subject. Supposing the gentleman to be a person of inexhaustible intelligence, capable of promptly responding to all questions, in reason, that may be shouted at him between trains, it would be attributing to him something more than the power of a spirit rapper to suppose him capable of wrestling with some of the interrogations that are puffed out at him by hurried passengers. HIS QUALIFICATIONS In deciding as to what qualifications a railway gateman should be blessed with, the circumstances must be considered under which his intellect is called into play. Of course, some may think he should find it as easy as rolling off a log to enlighten a fearsome traveller who desires to know if he will get to his destination all right. But before condemning the unhappy fellow for inability to reply to such an interrogation, or drawing the conclusion from his hesitancy that his intellect is infirm; that his thinking machinery is shattered or he should lay his head gear up for repairs, one should recollect that the question is popped at him amid the hurly-burly of railway station traffic, and he hasn’t time to properly clear his mental ordinance for action before his questioner is off down the platform, breathing maledictions on his stupidity, and other interrogators are pressing forward for enlightenment. This ceaseless tide of questionings developed into a flood during the dislocation of business following Monday's snowstorm. The poor gateman was given no opportunity to unpack the stores of his memory, to unlock the latent sources of information, or to offer up prayers to the Omnipotent for the gift of prophesy. His mental faculties exhaled through the excited stupidity of unanswerable questions were pierced by the sunshine of his intellect, and he had prepared himself to inform the first questioner that, although he hoped the Lord would prosper him on his journey, and bring him safe and sound unto his desired haven, he was really at a loss, just at the moment, to say with any degree of positiveness whether he would reach his destination all right or not; or before he (the gateman) was able to pronounce his hope, unqualified by any misgiving, that said passenger would safely reach the place set down in his ticket bill of lading; before he could do this, the inquisitive traveller was impelled through the gateway by the throng of intelligence seekers behind and the official found himself confronted with an earnest desire from another passenger to know if he thought the wind would drop. While mentally staggering under this second siege on his intellectual fortress and endeavoring to formulate some mental picture of the weather probabilities in order to determine with some reasonable degree of conscientiousness whether the wind would drop or not, the now perspiring official had his intellectual fabric shattered by a further question, and he was called upon forthwith to inform another traveller if it was likely to continue drifting. SOME OF THIS OUTSTANDING ""Holy Mother of Moses!"" exclaimed one who heard of these occurrences, from one of the afflicted ones, ""those questions are enough to drive a man crazy."" An interested one, however, soon learned that in the list of things dotted by an interrogation point, recorded daily in the chapter of the gateman's experiences, these questions were not counted. ""What time does the Canadian Pacific train leave?"" oftentimes pants an excited traveller, as he steams into the depot, mopping his face with a pocket-handkerchief and gasping beneath the weight of a huge portmanteau. ""What time does the Canadian Pacific train leave?"" again roars this befuddled wayfarer, driven into intellectual inanity through the terrific excitement engendered by a fear that something is going to go out of the station without him. ""All the way from 7 a.m. till 10 o'clock after sundown,"" says the gateman in reply to this comprehensive interrogation. ""Great Scott, then I've missed her,"" bellows the bewildered wayfarer, who is with difficulty persuaded to awaken his befuddled faculties, and to allow the official to find out what particular spot on the North American continent or elsewhere he wants to get to. After the gateman has persuaded this mentally muddled traveller that he is really destined for some definite objective point, and has seen him tumbling hurriedly down the platform toward his properly assigned travelling, probably a half an hour ahead of time, he occasionally finds his knowledge of the geography of places put to a test which threatens for the moment to send him to the foot of the class."

"18980207","TOLD IN A PARAGRAPH Passengers on the Toronto train arriving at Windsor street at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday reported that they had travelled through a continuous snowstorm all the way from Toronto. The meeting of the Gleaners' Union announced for the afternoon of Monday, February 7, will not take place, in consequence of sudden illness, at the house where it was to have been held. TRADE IN CANADA Reports From Different Cities at F JL Toronto February 6, Bradstreet's weekly trade summary says: Victoria and Vancouver The gold excitement continues to increase. Steamers are now leaving here almost daily, with passengers and freight accommodation taxed to their utmost in many cases freight space being booked several days ahead. One order, amounting to nearly two hundred thousand dollars, was recently secured by merchants here, from an Alaska company for shipment in May, and most dealers report January sales over 10 per cent higher than the corresponding month last year. Trade in the Interior remains quiet, with collections slow. Winnipeg Wheat has taken a drop and the grain market in general is flat. There has been quite a demand for shipments of felt shoes, moccasins, snowshoes, etc., but solely for the Yukon trade. An unusual feature for this season, but the possibilities of it being taken from the free-use are doubted. The business in hardware, paints, etc., is improving slightly, but no important change in prices is noticeable. Due to the mild winter the country produce trade has been the largest on record. Grocery prices remain firm. The most disastrous fire in the business history of the city occurred on the morning of the second, involving the total destruction of the McIntyre block and two other buildings, with twelve large retail stores, the bulk of the travellers' sample rooms, and some of the principal law offices. The estimated loss will reach four hundred thousand dollars, with an insurance of probably two hundred thousand. Halifax There is no improvement to report in trade circles, and the volume of business for the week has been light. Collections only fair. A heavy snowstorm blocking trains and delaying traffic was much felt all over the Maritime Provinces. St. John, New Brunswick, reports business for the past week rather quiet. The lumber trade in St. John is perhaps never in a more depressed state than it has been for some little time, partly owing to the large quantity of snow that has fallen lately in different parts of New Brunswick. A number of lumber contractors were compelled to leave their operations. The output of logs this winter is not expected to exceed 60 per cent of that of last year. Toronto Heavy snowstorms and extremely cold weather throughout the province have interfered with business this week. The weather conditions have been against any extension of trade, and the shipment of goods to retailers. But the conditions of trade may be said to have greatly improved. There are now good winter roads in all sections, and the prospects for large deliveries of grain, and a brisk demand at country points for staple goods, are better than at any time since the winter set in. Yesterday was the most important day of the year for payments on dry goods paper, it was attended with quite a few failures but on the whole the paper was generally well met, and when the customers at a distance are heard from within the next few days, it is expected the results will be quite up to expectations. There were some requests for extensions, but the percentage of renewals was not as large as last year. The fourth of February in the dry-goods trade is regarded as a crucial test for country traders. The wholesalers are not anxious to ship goods for the coming season till it is found how payments are met, and now that the date has been passed, rather more satisfactorily than expected, trade will become more active in many lines. Wools are in good demand and firmer. Hides are firm. Leathers are moving out well and at good prices, and tanners say they have sufficient orders to keep them busy for two months. A better enquiry is experienced from Klondike parties for outfits both in the way of provisions and clothing, it being found that supplies can be bought cheaper here than in the west, and as these orders are for cash the result is that such business is bringing about the circulation of a good deal of money. Canadian woolen mills are busy on orders for goods suitable for the mining camps. The money market here is unchanged. Montreal Extra severe weather and a general blocking of country roads by snow has lowered the record for business. During the earlier part of the week, travellers were snow-bound, in the majority of instances, when off lines of railway. Remittances were sensibly decreased, and orders scarce. Towards the close conditions became nearly normal, and obligations maturing on the fourth were met better than last year, but as usual, too many renewals were asked for. The failure list has also kept up the averages, but there were no very serious ones in this province. A steady business continues in paints, oils and glass, and retailers seem satisfied to pay an advance on last year's prices. Hardware fairly active, with a good general distribution, and in this trade the losses by bad debts continue light. Grocery firms are just now taking stock, some have inventories completed, and the general results show an improvement over the preceding year. In this trade short credits and a quick turnover, even with comparatively small profits, show that there is money in the business. Flour dealers report business quiet, the demand being largely local. Canned goods are also moving slowly, but at firm quotations. Railway earnings show handsome increases, with a likelihood of an early termination of the cutting of rates. The trade of Montreal city keeps up satisfactorily, and has not suffered to any great extent by snowstorms, the Street Railway having successfully overcome any opposition there may be from that source. In fact, the service is considered one of the best on the continent. The stock market has shown up well for the week, but there seem to be few spots that can safely be engineered to much higher figures. Quebec A slight improvement is noticed in general business during the past week over that of the preceding one. Wholesale dry goods and grocers report orders coming in better, but collections are not quite up to the mark. Local flour dealers report a better demand, and prices have advanced 10c to 15c per barrel. Shoe manufacturers appear to be busy. Hides are reported scarce and in active demand."
"18980208","MORE KLONDIKERS: Another Party of Young Englishmen Sound for Gold and Glory. It is scarcely news nowadays to hear of the passage of gold seekers through Montreal destined for the Klondike. Railway officials have already come to regard their arrival in the city and their departure on their way westward as a matter of ordinary travel, and the Klondikers attract but little more attention than any other class of immigrant. Now that the spring is beginning to loom up in the not far distant prospect, this westward travel will no doubt gradually increase, and the Klondiker and his baggage will occasion no more than passing comment. A party of ten, mostly young Englishmen, left for the West on the o'clock train yesterday afternoon. They were carrying all their supplies in anticipation of snowstorms and a cold journey. Altogether, they had a large truckload of baggage; and the members of the enterprise wore that determined expression of countenance which said plainer than words that they intended to get to Klondike or bust."
"18980215","February 14 The steamer Clara Nevada, of Seattle, formerly the Hessler of the United States revenue service, has been burned in the Lynn Canal and 40 men who were on board are supposed to have perished. The Nevada left Skagway for Juneau on February 6th, and when the Islander, which arrived at Comox this morning, reached Juneau the Nevada had not arrived there. The day that she should have reached Juneau a fire was seen on the waters of the canal and the opinion is general that the flames were from the burning steamer. Whether the passengers and crew reached land or whether they perished is in doubt. It is feared that they met with death as there have been terrible wind and snowstorms in the north and small boats could hardly live. Capt. Irwin of the Islander reports that the weather has been terrific."
"18980216","IN THE SENATE The Address in Reply Adopted Without a Division In the Senate this afternoon the debate on the address was continued by Hon. Donald Ferguson, who spoke against the Yukon policy of the Government. Hon. Mr. Bernier maintained that there was no reference to the school question in the speech from the Throne, and considered that the question was not settled and could not be settled until Justice had been done to the minority. Senator Boulton: What would you have this Parliament do? Senator Bernier: I would recommend remedial legislation if the provincial Government refuses to give us our full rights. He urged the passage of an insolvency law. The working of the new law should relegate the whole matter of insolvency to tribunals of commerce. If this were done the country would have an insolvency law that would fill the wants of the people, and stand. Senator Clemow pleaded for the construction of the Georgian Bay Canal and announced his intention to ask for a committee of the Senate this session to inquire into the whole question and report upon its feasibility. He also was in favor of the adoption of an insolvency law. The absence of such a law was injuring Canada's credit in England, and he thought the Government ought to bring down such a law this session. The address was then carried without division and the striking committee appointed to nominate the standing committees for the session, after which the Senate adjourned. A CONVICT SHOT While Attempting to Escape From Kingston Penitentiary Kingston, Ont., February 15. William Carr, serving ten years for arson, and W. O'Connor, five years for robbery, made a dash for liberty from the penitentiary here this afternoon. They were returning with a gang from the quarry when they attempted to get away in the snowstorm. One of the guards fired, striking Carr in the abdomen, and both men were soon secured. Carr's wound will probably prove fatal. The Ottawa Races Ottawa, February 18. (Special) It was expected to pull off the unfinished free-for-all and 2:40 class here yesterday or today, but there was so much water from Saturday's heavy rain that the judge called the books off and allowed the money to be divided as the horses finished on Friday. Bets in both races are off. The evidence in the case proves Mood's Barsansarilla cures Scrofula, Skin Eruptions, and all Humors. CHITRAL CAMPAIGN Discussed in the British Commons Yesterday A MUCH NEEDED REFORM The present moment may not be untimely for the suggestion of a needed reform in the administration of our city. The recent snowstorm only made more glaring the lack of uniformity in our winter sidewalks. The worst of the present haphazard system is that householders who leave the task of keeping their share of the street in order to the passing public are, in some instances, as well rewarded as those who are at pains all through the season to maintain it in good condition. Indeed, a policy of laissez-faire is in general more likely to fit in with the prevalent rule than exceptional effort to adhere to a high standard. Strangers visiting Montreal in midwinter are at a loss when they contemplate the variety of pattern that distinguishes the sidewalks in some of our streets, as to the regulations which impose such diversity, or the laxness that permits it. The hogsbacks, the cabot, the occasional square of boarding, and every height from that level to a foot or more, with an equal multiplicity of gauge, this chaotic trail is no slight trial to one's equanimity. If good taste, a sense of public duty, and a desire to obey the law, so far as it is known, did not in some streets or terraces counteract sentiments less social, the disorder would be intolerable. But why should there be any departure from the better standard of those citizens who put the public weal and neighborly goodwill before individual whim, or the temptation to shirk obligation? Why should not the council take charge of the sidewalks, and thus insist, by doing the thing themselves, on that uniformity of level and gauge which is alone compatible with reason and the public convenience? This plan has already been adopted by some cities on this continent, and even in Canada. It would be easy to obtain such statistics of the more important municipalities in which winter road maintenance is a problem of difficulty, and by a comparison of them attain something like certainty as to which of them is the most effective and economical. It is too late in the season to accomplish any great improvement this winter, but if Montreal is to take rank as an attractive and commodious and fairly secure all-the-year-round place of residence or sojourn, this question must receive definite and speedy solution. We have but slightly touched the point of safety. There was a time when the policy with regard to sidewalks rendered dangerous either by icicles depending from eaves or by the state of the surface, was simply to leave them, and thus open street. This is no longer possible. The great advantage of a regular and rapid car service has not been obtained without certain sacrifices. The very perfection of administration whereby after a snowstorm of rare severity the public are assured of uninterrupted city and suburban service necessarily encroaches on the road rights of equestrian, if not pedestrian, travelers. At the same time it has been proved by experience that there is no emergency or stress of weather that may not be provided against by system, dispatch, and the sinews of war. As for the ordinary phenomena of our winters, no person who has had any experience of civic administration can fail to know that, if only the expense were provided for, the boon of good sidewalks in winter as in summer could be enjoyed. Under the actual regulation, which enjoins a uniformity that is never universally enforced, some householders pay for having their front kept clear of snow, and otherwise adapted to the requirements of the law; others undertake to do the work themselves. There are terraces or even longer stretches of street in which householders agree to maintain a uniform level all winter. This may be done by each of them conforming to a common plan, or by all of them entrusting the duty to an outsider, who undertakes the task for a fixed sum, towards which all the beneficiaries proportionately contribute. Now, why should not an honest council or road committee assume this responsibility for all the citizens, and charge them for the service in proportion to their rating in the economic census? It might be charged directly on proprietors, but it would be fairer, perhaps, to make each tenant pay his share, as some landlords might make the tax a pretext for raising the rent. That is, however, a matter for consideration after the first step has been taken towards the adoption of the new system. That objections would be urged against the change is likely enough. A great many tenants of low-rent houses may protest against any imposition of additional burdens, and may fear an arrangement that, in their opinion, may be a boon for the richer class of citizens, but of little advantage to them. To this protest it may be replied that, if the estimate of total cost and its distribution among the householders be honestly made, the quotas that even the largest proprietors or first-class of householders would have to pay would be materially less than the expenses that they unavoidably incur at present; while for the humbler class of tenants the proportional charge would be insignificant. It is really a simple sum in arithmetic. The advantages to be derived from the new departure are obvious. Our streets will be more attractive, locomotion will be unattended with discomfort and danger, as at present; the workingmen will gain by the need of employing a regular staff of laborers; poor and rich will alike profit by the additional security; the tale of fatal or serious accidents will be diminished; the business community will gain considerably; snow barricades, interfering with traffic will be among the things of the past; strangers will no longer wish they had not come and natives and aliens will be saved those trials of temper, which, oft repeated, are inimical to health. The care of the streets in winter can hardly be separated from the spring overhauling, the prompt and efficient discharge of which is essential to our well-being. With the regular ordering of the sidewalks (including all that affects the free movement, safety, and comfort of pedestrians), ought, indeed, to be joined the maintenance in a fair state of cleanliness of our lanes. When a thaw occurs the condition of some of them can be realized at some distance off by the sense of smell, and, as spring comes on, the ordure heaps in some of them become intolerably offensive as well as a source of danger to the health of the neighborhood. There is one usage which, in any case, should be made to cease without delay: that of dumping objectionable refuse in open spaces, the as yet unbuilt-on portions, generally, of new streets. It may be that, in some cases, this is done with the consent of the owner of the land, but no owner should have the option of selling privileges injurious to other proprietors or tenants. The open space in the rear, as in front, is often one of the recommendations of a dwelling when the family comprises children. In summer, if well kept, it adds to the conveniences of those who occupy the fronting houses. That it should be fouled in the way indicated is therefore a grave injustice. In fact, the maintenance of our streets and the preservation of our health are closely associated. It is full time that the reform called for should begin, if not exactly in the way indicated, in some way equally effectual. Why have our streets been enlarged and beautified, if the use of them is to continue perilous and the sight of them unseemly? How can we expect strangers to take our word that Montreal is a healthy city, if we lay ourselves open to the reproach that we allow the foes of its well-being to triumph? THE U"

His official ultimatum and he thought he had the moral support of the community was that unless them papte got out of that windy, he'd pinch the whole blamed lot of them So the people got out of the window But there was great and abiding sorrow in the heart of Messrs Scott and Son They felt that the inviolable rights of Art had been rudely trampled upon, that hallowed traditions had been hit in the neck and that modern iconoclasm had no right to cut in on an ancient game as it were Apollo in trousers or the Uffizi wrestlers in white trunks with green Irish flags girded around their loins grated awfully on their artistic sensibilities Besides, they did not like to believe that their treasures were being viewed as athletic exhibitions or living pictures Chief Hughes was appealed to and, having lived for some time in the artistic atmosphere of Italy, he quickly grasped the force of the remarks With his own mighty right hand, he annulled the decree of his most moral subordinate, and soulfully, as befits a lover of Art, replaced the Venus de Milo in the show window Thus did the Good and Pure again triumph over misconception and ignorance Captain Beatty, one of the Chief's assistants, explained the occurrence fully late last evening Some one had called him up by telephone, it seems, and protested against the indecency of an exhibit in a Notre Dame street store Worried and bothered as he was, he entered the protest along with others concerning lately deceased cats and dogs which should have been deceased, but weren't, in a large book Unfortunately, he seems to have assigned his deceased cat officer to the art exhibit This, it is stated on good authority, will not happen again WILL INVESTIGATE RENTALS Snowstorm Proves a Bane for the Unemployed Building Inspector's Report The Market Committee met yesterday afternoon, being the first to get together under the new civic regime Aid Jacques is the chairman and the other members present were Aid Turner, Roy, Lareau and Gallery The chairman explained that he had not much business to lay before the meeting There was lots of work to be done which might come at a future occasion He said he had received a letter from Lucien Auclair, asking for permission to use the old Town Hall in St Jean Baptiste ward as a place of worship pending the rebuilding of St Jean Baptiste church, recently destroyed by fire He thought it would be a graceful act to comply with the request, on the understanding that all expenses incurred would be defrayed by the church authorities Two of the tenants of St Lawrence market wrote to the secretary of the committee protesting that if the roof over their stalls was not repaired they would sue the city for damages The chairman, however, explained that on learning of the matter, he had taken upon himself to have the necessary renovations made, and the committee consequently endorsed his action Aid Gallery asked for a statement of all outstanding accounts of the department and was promised a detailed report by the chairman A communication of considerable importance was read from the fruit dealers occupying stalls on the south side of Commissioners street They protested that their business thereabouts had decreased so in late years that many of the cellars, as they term them were vacant As a consequence they asked for a reduction of rent, it appeared that the rent of the stalls had been hitherto from $300 to $360 per annum The petitioners wanted it reduced to $200 Mr Tessler, the clerk of the market, insisted upon something being done about the matter He pointed out that many of the petitioners had been lessees of stalls for thirty years and over and they had now refused to sign their leases unless the reduction asked for was granted Two of the stalls had been idle since November last Aid Gallery pointed out that it would be a bad precedent to establish if the committee sanctioned any reduction of the rent The chairman remarked that a revenue must be derived from some source, and Aid Turner reminded the new aldermen that the whole question had been referred to the City Attorneys a year ago and was still in their hands It was, however, finally decided to refer the whole matter to a sub-committee composed of the chairman, Aid Lareau and Gallery to report at the next meeting The snowstorm which set in at an early hour yesterday morning has been accompanied by the usual discomfort to pedestrians, but has been a blessing to the poor and indigents of the city The Road Department, as usual, has been equal to the occasion and bright and early had its permanent staff increased by two hundred hands yesterday morning The streets, as a consequence, were fairly passable throughout the day In reply to The Gazette, Mr B, February 16 Steamer Teelin Head, of the Head line, arrived this afternoon;

"18980222","NEW YORK, New York, February 21, Today A decline in the stock market was made without any special new development in the situation, but was rather to be attributed to a combination of factors which have been the underlying speculation for a week or more. Today's market demonstrated among that last week's declines would have been much heavier on the developments in the Cuban question had it not been for the support of powerful interests, who desired an opportunity to realize. The entire absence of support today gave color to the supposition that these interests had completed their liquidation and were indifferent to the course of the market. The motives assigned for the selling had less apparent basis, in fact, than were furnished by the events of last week. So far as they turned on the Cuban question, they dealt with speculations on possible future events and on abstruse points of international law without any convincing authority to back them. Apprehensions growing out of the rate war for passenger business between the Canadian Pacific and American transcontinental lines had a more substantial basis, though a soothing suggestion was offered that profits and dividends were not largely dependent upon passenger business anyhow. There seemed to be no realizing sense that this suggestion was inconsistent with the large advances which had been forced in the prices of securities on hopes of Klondike traffic. The great snowstorm in the West was also a factor of real importance both by reason of the interruption to railroad traffic and the possible damage to crops. Whatever the real motive, it was beyond dispute that there were large offerings of securities for which there was no adequate demand and selling orders to stop losses were uncovered on the descending scale. Declines were of so great an extent that prices that looked attractive as bargains were reached in many cases and the buying thus invited steadied prices and worked some notable recoveries. This process was repeated several times during the day and the market closed with one of the recoveries in full force, thus leaving the net declines decidedly smaller than the extreme declines during the day. In the cases of Sugar and Metropolitan Street Railway this recovery was between two and three points and Third Avenue made an extraordinary rally of 12 points in the final dealings after an earlier loss of eight points. The local and industrial specialties were the severest sufferers by the early decline and the Grangers who were notably affected by reason of the storm. New York Central reflected a marked liquidation of recent speculative buying. Manhattan was one of the chief sufferers and after a fall of 4 5/8, rallied 1 1/2. Metropolitan Street Railway was seven points off at the lowest. A feature of the day was the marking up of call loans to 1 8/4 per cent, in accordance with the reduction in the surplus reserve. The local market paid no attention to the firmer tone on foreign exchanges, due to the subsidence of apprehension over the West African situation, which was regarded with such acute misgivings on the local exchange on Saturday. London was a buyer on balance in the New York market today.

"18980223","B, February 22 (Special) Provincial Secretary Tweedle made his budget speech tonight. The estimated expenditure for this year is $294,977, or six thousand less than last year, with the supplementary estimate yet to be heard from. Among the new items is one thousand dollars to the Good Roads Association. The finances of the province are in a deplorable condition, the net debt being close to two and a half million dollars, having nearly quadrupled in twelve years. For the year ending 31st October last, the bonded debt increased almost $120,000, and the debit balance carried to 1898 in spite of largely increased receipts from Crown lands, etc., is $69,371, with $53,674 additional over expenditure by the public works. Snowstorms on the C.G. Adams, who is still at the General Hospital suffering from injuries sustained on Sunday afternoon last, was reported to be resting easy. The complaints of neighbors, a disorderly house which had only been in existence a short time on St. Hubert Street, near Sherbrooke, and almost opposite the Mayor's residence, was raided on Monday. BLOCKS ALL TRAINS. Snowstorm Flays Havoc With Railways. PLOUGHS RENDERED USELESS Tea and Twelve Feet of Drifted Snow Scarcely Yield to Repeated and Powerful Attacks. The great snowstorm caused the Canadian Pacific officials to hustle, but last evening saw Mr. Spencer satisfied that the worst was over and, in fact, quite confident that by this morning all the inward and outward trains would be running on time. The storm was, however, a Godsend to the working classes, as from three to four hundred men were engaged all day yesterday at the C.R. track. Charles Van Allen, a resident of this town, employed lately at Iroquois, started to walk home on the track in a blinding snowstorm which was raging at the time. He must have been struck by a passing train, but was not found until the noon express went West. When picked up he was still alive. He was taken to Iroquois, where he died this afternoon. CITY HALL ECHOES. City Assessors and Their New Salaries, SURVEYOR IN MORE TROUBLE. Present Snowstorm Has Swamped Mr. St. George's Calculations. Other Current Gossip. The secretaries of the different departments in the City Hall are at present engaged in preparing the annual reports, which, by the way, should be on hand after the first meeting of the new council. Many of the gentlemen charged with the recording of the events of the year, and the compilation of statistics have, no doubt, some excuse for the apparent dilatoriness, but the majority should have their reports ready for the members' consideration, so that they can give an intelligent vote when the report comes before the council. According to the statement of one of the city assessors, there is trouble brewing over, paradoxically as it may seem, the proposal to increase their salaries. It is well known that the position of assessor in a city of the size and influence of Montreal is an important one, and at the last meeting of the Finance Committee, Aid. Beatty emphasized this fact by appealing to his colleagues to give them an increase. It was explained that a city assessor formerly entered the service of the corporation at a salary of $1,200 per annum, the limit being $1,600. The chairman of the board was allowed some two hundred dollars extra. The resolution of the last meeting of the Finance Committee made the salary of the assessor upon taking office $1,400 and an annual increase of $100 until it reached the limit of $2,000. The friction that is likely to arise under the above resolution is due to the fact that the members of the board who have been in the employ of the corporation for the last five or six years think that they are entitled to the maximum salary when the resolution of the Finance Committee takes effect, which is on 1st January, 1899. The chairman of the Finance Committee intimated at the last meeting that it was the intention to hold an evening séance when important questions of this sort might be discussed without interruption from lawyers and deputations. Mr. Percival St. George, City Surveyor, is figuratively (not literally) tearing his hair over the condition of the streets of Canada's great commercial metropolis. At the last meeting of the Road Committee, when the present Mayor was the chairman, the City Surveyor, though not in so many words, conveyed the idea that he was not a prophet or the son of one, but he believed that if another snowstorm should loom up, he would be in dire straits in his efforts to make the streets passable. Mr. St. George told the committee under the presidency of Aid. Brunet the same story and the report, carefully prepared, was referred to the Finance Committee really to get rid of it. When it reached the Finance, Mr. St. George was hauled over the coals for certain irregularities which he could possibly know nothing about, and Aid. Beausoleil had the nerve to ask him if it was not a fact that certain carters were not taking the ""beautiful"" from the streets and depositing it in vacant lots adjacent. The consequence is that Mr. St. George, ever since the snow commenced to fly, has been handicapped. He has, under the circumstances, done wonders with the means at his disposal. Yesterday he had 1,200 men, horses, and carts on all the leading thoroughfares. He thinks that it will probably cost something between $90,000 and $100,000 to foot the bill before he can place the streets in good order. Following the thaw comes the deluge and at the present moment it is too awful to contemplate and the litigation over flooded cellars and basements in the coming summer will keep the city's legal advisers on the tension. Today being Ash Wednesday, and the beginning of the Lenten season, the City Hall, banks, and public institutions generally will be closed. The chairmen of the civic committees have not properly settled down to work yet. The holiday intervening during the present week somewhat upset the usual routine. Tomorrow the Health, Fire, and Parks and Ferries Committees are summoned, but the business is not expected to be of very much public interest."
"18980224","NEW BRUNSWICK NEWS Railway Service Badly Crippled by the Snowstorm St John, N.P.R. said yesterday that he had never seen the like of it in his experience, and he has seen something of railways and snowstorms in his time. Mr. Spencer had been out all the previous night superintending the work of the snow-ploughs on the lines, and although the trains were able to resume their trips yesterday, it was only because of an amount of exertion that the company has perhaps never been called upon to make before in battling with the elements. Between Boult aux Kecollet and La-chute, and St. Martin's Junction and Quebec, there were places where the storm had buried everything in the shape of a railway out of sight, and it was on these sections that the greatest difficulty was experienced in maintaining a passage for the traffic. For distances along these lines the road presents the aspect of having been cleft through the snow. There are great walls of solidly-packed snow on either side, towering above the cars in places, and leaving a bare margin for them to get through. These walls of snow almost touch the car windows. Such are the accumulations of snow in plains that the tops of telegraph poles are the only landmarks. There are something like three thousand men constantly at work over these lines to prevent the traffic from being closed up. There were four snow ploughs on the road between Montreal and Ottawa yesterday, and they have been constantly at work since Sunday. Mr. Spencer said it would be necessary to keep them at work night and day until the weather cleared. Some of these ploughs are propelled by four locomotives, and it requires often a succession of efforts of their united power to force a way through the snow and give it the necessary lift to throw it clear of the railway. Sometimes the ploughs will dive into a drift and stick there. Two other locomotives, which are kept in the rear to watch for the contingencies, then take a hand in and help their brethren out of the difficulty. These ploughs rush against the snow obstruction from the distance of a mile or so at a speed equal to sixty miles an hour, and sometimes the plough is buried entirely in the drift and the snow, forced into the air by the terrific impact, falls in tons upon the nearest engine and sometimes deluges the men in the cab. It is no wonder after all that it requires six locomotives to get clear again. The two rear locomotives that follow the snow ploughs to assist in hauling out carry also a large number of men, supplied with shovels, and when, as sometimes happens, the plough gets stuck altogether, gunners are thrown out to clear away and loosen things up as it were, to enable the plough to prepare for another onslaught. Mr. Spencer said he had been railroading now for twenty-seven years and had never so much trouble caused by snow before. The lines were open now, however, and they expected to be able to keep them open. S. Hardy will not speak outside of his constituency during the week. In his last four he suffered an attack of bronchitis and has not recovered. During the week he will spend the time in Toronto and in Brant. Hon. William Harty will again return to Toronto. The campaign is wearing on him very much. It was very much against the wishes of his friends and medical advisers that Mr. Harty went east on Monday for the nomination and the excitement of the trip has been anything but beneficial. There was a great deal of uneasiness in some of the departments at the province buildings yesterday afternoon. It occurred in this way: A well-known gentleman about the buildings went up and told the crowd of clerks and civil servants that 10 Conservatives had been elected by acclamation. This put them on pins and needles. Quickly this report spread and there was consternation till it was found the story was incorrect. SITUATION IN RUSSELL Toronto, February 23 An evening paper says: Colonel Clarke, clerk of the Legislative Assembly, is somewhat exercised over the report from Ottawa that, owing to the snowstorm, the returning officer for Russell county was unable to reach Duncanville, the place of nomination, and that in consequence no nomination took place. Colonel Clarke cannot, after long and careful research, find the least trace of Duncanville on the maps to which he has access, and has therefore telegraphed to Ottawa to obtain information as to the state of affairs. As to the statement coming from the capital that a by-election will be necessary in Russell, he contradicts it emphatically. Section 36, sub-section J, of the Election Act, provides expressly that in case the returning officer, from unforeseen delay, does not open the nomination until after the hour named, the nomination shall not on that account be invalid if the delay does not affect the result of the election. Section 13 of the same statute enacts that when in case of emergency a nomination is not commenced on the proper day, the returning officer shall hold it on the following day at nine o'clock in the forenoon, and continue from day to day, if necessary, until a fair opportunity for the nominating of candidates is given. The question however arises as to the date of polling. It is a moot point upon which legal advice will be necessary, whether the election in the constituency can take place on March 1st, even if the provisions of the Act given above are made use of. The point may also crop up that one or other party would be injured by the postponement of the nomination, in which case application might be made to invalidate under section 6."
"18980225","Williams, a country produce dealer of Independence, la, sent two mares of commonplace breeding to Ash Grove in 1885. One was bred to William L, and foaled Axtell, 2:12. The other was bred to Jay Bird, and produced Allerton, 2:09 1-4. Both colts lived to lower the world's record for trotting stallions, and when five years old each commanded a stud fee of $1,000. It is well known that Williams received $105,000 for Axtell, and it has been said that he refused $125,000 for Allerton. William L, the sire of Axtell, was sold last week for $426. He was a full brother to Guy Wilkes, 2:15 1-4, but he never ranked with that horse as a trotting sire, Axtell being the only high-class performer to his credit. At sixteen years of age he is the sire of six trotters and three pacers in the 2:30 list. Betterton, the brother to Lumps, 2:21, brought only $225 at the sale last week. He was eighteen years old, and was not one of the best sons of George Wilkes. He got no fast trotters except George St. Clair, 2:15 1-4, and Nora B, 2:17 1-2, but he has also to his credit the pacers Prima Donna, 2:09 1-4, George St. Clair, 2:10 1-4, and Tony Wilcox, 2:11 1-2. Monte Cristo, another full brother to Lumps, brought $260 at the closing-out sale. He is 17 years of age, and has only one representative to the 2:20 list, Christo Queen, a pacer with a record of 2:11 1-4. Prince Charles, by George Wilkes, out of Sue Stout, by Surplus, was knocked down for $210. Frank Jones, 2:16 1-2, is the only trotter to his credit at 16 years of age. Jay Bird, Eagle Bird, and Yuma Jim were the only sires of any real note in the Ash Grove collection. Jay Bird is 20 years old and is now blind. As the sire of Allerton, 2:09 1-4; Early Bird, 2:10; Laramie, 2:13 3-4; Rose Croix, 2:13 1-2; Jayhawker, 2:14 3-4; Birdie Clay, 2:14 3-4, and more than fifty other trotters in the 2:30 list, Jay Bird ranks as one of the best sons of George Wilkes. He never got a pacer until last year. In spite of his age and his blindness he was considered a remarkably cheap horse at $2,600. Eagle Bird, 2:21, the son of Jay Bird, is closely inbred to George Wilkes, both his sire and his dam being by the old horse. His great grandam was a mare that Dan Mace used as a running mate for one of his old-time trotters. At 16 years of age Eagle Bird has twenty-two trotters to his credit in the 2:30 list. Among them are such good ones as Alamito, 2:10 1-2; Monbars, 2:11 2-4; Eagle Flanagan, 2:18 1-4; and Margaret, 2:16. Eagle Bird is small in size and roan in color.

His dam was Lear's Sir William, a running-bred horse, and she produced the old-time trotter Jim Irving, 2:23. Young Jim was foaled in 1274. He is one of the few trotting sires having three of their get in the 2:10 list. These are: Trevii-Han, 2:08 1-4; David B, 2:08 1-4; and Dandy Jim, 2:09 3-4. Young Jim is credited with thirty-two trotters and is pacers in the 2:30 list. Not a few horsemen expected that he would sell for more than any of the other Simmons stallions, but he brought only $775. None of the sons of Young Jim has yet gained any distinction as a sire. ICE MEN IN TROUBLE Recent Weather Not In Their Favor. CLEAR ICE HARD TO FIND A Possibility That Aid May Be Asked From Other Cities During the Summer Months. Those engaged in the ice industry are laboring under difficulties this year. The protracted spell of bad weather, and the heavy falls of snow, have not only made it impossible to carry on cutting operations, but have in a large measure, spoiled the chances of securing crops of good ice. The succession of snowstorms which have banked up the city streets and impeded traffic on the railways, have kept the ice dealers continually busy to keep their channels clear of snow, and they have only been able to do this to a limited extent. In order to secure a uniform quality of ice the workmen must keep the snow removed from the areas that they propose to work on. The snow is shovelled away and banked up around the area and the weight of this snow causes the cleared space to bulge upward, forming a sort of water shed, which keeps the surface of the ice dry and ensures a clear formation. Of course, when the ice or such cleared spaces is exhausted, new channels must be taken up and on these a considerable thickness of inferior, snowy ice has already formed, which will cause a large proportion of the cut to be of a poor quality. Last year at this time the ice dealers had their storehouses pretty well filled up, but comparatively little of this season's crop has been harvested thus far. Messrs.

"18980228","B, the provision market is very firm and breadstuffs are all marked higher. The market for lumber remains very dull, with (50) exports very small. Spring business is likely to open with a low range of prices. Toronto The reduced passenger rates on the railways have had a good effect on business this week. The heavy snowstorms at the beginning of the week made trade dull in the country and greatly reduced the number of letter orders coming in, but there were more buyers in the wholesale houses here, many of them coming from distant points. The business in Klondike orders has become an important factor in wholesale trade now and the sales are very large. There has been a good volume of business done in dry goods for the spring trade and owing to the improved condition of retail business merchants are buying more largely than for some years. Hides are weaker and are likely to be lower in price soon. Leathers are quiet but firm and one or two lines are higher this week. Wools are in good demand and firmer. The mills are all very busy and it is now impossible to repeat orders at the same prices quoted four months ago. There is a better business being done in metals and hardware. Boots and shoes are fairly active and a good demand is experienced for special lines for the west. The deliveries of grain at country points, which last week were very small, are increasing again. Country remittances are improving. The money market is unchanged and easy at 6 to 7 percent for mercantile discounts, and 4 percent for call loans. Montreal The business of the week ending February 26th has been seriously curtailed by the unprecedented snow blockade, which was caused by the storms of Monday and Tuesday. Travellers who were snowbound were unable to move until Thursday, and but few orders were received until the last two or three days. Wednesday also was a legal holiday, collections have suffered accordingly. The Clearing House returns show a very large increase over the corresponding week last year, which is largely accounted for by the extra activity of the stock exchange. Considerable money has been lost in Montreal by speculators who dealt in New York stocks. In some instances the losses are very heavy. The local banks are well supplied with funds, and while money is a little firmer the rates have not advanced, the rate for call loans being still 4 percent. Next week will likely be a busy one in Montreal, the millinery openings will be attended by a larger crowd of buyers than usual, due to cheap fares. There have not been any very important failures, a few having been expected for some time having to succumb. Prospects are entirely favorable to an expansion of business, with the advent of spring. Trade during the past week, both wholesale and retail, has been demoralized, caused by the heavy snowstorm, which in other words may be termed a blizzard, which began on the evening of the 20th and continued until the evening of the 23rd, blocking the railways and the city electric cars, the first time the latter have been stalled this winter. It will take several days before the blockade has been properly raised and country points heard from."
"18980307","Weddel & Co, February 28, 1897, London, writes: Butter Early in the week a sudden change in temperature occurred, and from comparatively mild weather, some parts of the United Kingdom were unexpectedly plunged under snow, which blocked up roads and made traffic exceedingly difficult, the heaviest snow falling in the southwest of England. Snowstorms also visited Ireland. In Denmark and Sweden low temperatures and a heavy fall of snow prevailed. At the close of the week, however, appearances indicate a return to milder weather. The demand for Australian and New Zealand butter has continued good, and business has been brisk during the greater part of the week. Values have advanced again, and ""Choicest"" brands are bringing 102 to 106s per cwt, the latter figure being made mostly for new butter per Orizaba, which vessel has docked today. Some few sales of special brands in small lots are reported at 108s. It is interesting to note that those agents who before Christmas were the first to bring values down and break the market are now forcing prices to the utmost. This sudden change of policy is causing considerable comment in the trade, which attributes the new movement to inspiration received from producers in the colonies. It is a pity this zeal for high prices did not begin before the closing weeks of the season. The Orizaba, which docked today, brings 20,005 boxes, being the last large shipment of Australian butter this season. The next three vessels when added together are not bringing as much butter as the Orizaba. As far as cabled information goes, the following is the quantity of Australian butter afloat for this country: The Cornwall, 7,058 boxes; Himalaya, 8,013; Britannia, 7,671; Oroya, 1,760; and Oceana, 5,000. The Cuzco, which follows the Oceana, is bringing the first cargo of apples, so that hereafter butter will be driven to secure what accommodation it can on steamers that are not regular mailers. Between the Himalaya and Britannia, there is no Orient liner, owing to the new mail system coming into operation, and it is expected that the Britannia will be only seven days after the Himalaya. From New Zealand about 1,111 tons of butter will arrive in March, while from Australia the total will not exceed 732 tons. As showing the effect of the drought, we shall receive from Australia 518 tons less and from New Zealand 630 tons more butter than in the month of March last year. The Copenhagen committee have left the Danish Official Quotation unchanged, although the market there is firm. This is a wise and sensible decision, for any advance might have been the last straw to break the camel's back. The advance in values has been so rapid and the price is now at such a height that buyers are beginning to act very cautiously. Retail traders do not relish having to raise prices to the householder, but circumstances are forcing them to do so, and the Danes have done wisely in not compelling the retailer to move too rapidly. Margarine mixtures are finding more favor than they were a few weeks ago, and if butter were forced too much the retailers would run back on them to replace butter. As it is, the scarcity of butter will cause firm markets for the next few weeks, though the rise in values may cause larger imports from the continent as well as from Canada and the United States, a turn of events by no means improbable. Cheese: The market continues a thin and dragging, with prices nominally unchanged. There is a quantity of Canadian on the market being forcibly realized at cheap prices, owing to not being according to contract, though had the market been good it would not have been rejected. The Gothic landed her New Zealand cheese in good condition, but sales are slow and prices very discouraging."

Archibald, ex-chief engineer of the Intercolonial, was recalled and examined by Mr. PorwcB as to the standard of the Intercolonial, and the particulars in which the Drummond County road fell short of it. He said that the embankment on the Drummond County road was lower than on the Intercolonial, and therefore, more liable to be affected by snowstorms; the ditches were too close to the embankment, the ballasting was not as good as that of the Intercolonial; the embankment was too narrow, and the ties were only seven feet long and ""flatted,"" while those on the Intercolonial were nine feet long and ""squared,"" which was an advantage, as the frost went more evenly out of a square tie than out of a flatted one. He found twenty miles of road on the Drummond Counties unfenced, which would cost about $440 a mile to fence.

"18980409","W. Sadler and Peter Lyall GOLF TUB UNIVERSITY MATCHES IN ENGLAND The London Times says: The universities have not been fortunate in their first attempt to extend their golf competition from 18 to 36 holes. Yesterday's weather experiences over the St. George's links were so much opposed to golf and golfers that the last four rounds had to be given up before playing out, so blinding was the snowstorm. Tallying the returns up to that point, the record showed Cambridge to have doubled their advantage of the morning and to be ten holes up. Several of the players were against this giving up of matches, and for an hour the subject as to the proper action in the circumstances was widely discussed, both by the teams themselves and by several more experienced members of the St. George's club. One argument was that the players having mutually agreed to leave the course, the unplayed holes were practically halved; another member suggested that the match, as it was not played to a finish, was drawn. After much dispute, the captains agreed to refer the matter to Mr. Mills, of the St. George's committee, who decided that the unplayed holes should be finished. Two hours had elapsed, and in the meantime the weather had improved in that the snow had ceased; but the northeasterly gale still swept the links when the four couples started to play the balance of some 18 holes, and it was then past five o'clock. Cambridge further improved their advantage and won in the end by 11 holes up. The rough weather of the morning did not affect the golf of some of the men. Many of them kept the line splendidly in the drive, but putting seemed to be made particularly difficult by the wind. The greens were in superb condition. Perhaps the most brilliant round of the morning was that of Apthorp, of Cambridge. Nothing better could have been seen in golf than his out; the drive, the approach and the put were all splendidly demonstrated by him. His figures were: out 4 4 4 2 4 3 Home 7 4 6 5 4 6 4. His return with such a strong wind was remarkable, and but for getting into the bunker in front of the last hole he would have been home in 30. As it was he finished 6 up. At this final hole many players came to grief; he also found Henderson off his game; the latter was constantly in difficulties and finished 1 down. This, curiously enough, was the reverse of last year's match between these men. Until, however, Henderson himself in the afternoon made remarkable birdie conditions under which it was played. He went round in 31 and finished 2 up on the round, thereby reducing his loss of the morning by 30 percent. His figures were: out 4 4 4 4 3 3 Home 4 4 4 5 4 4. He had a wonderful drive and played with perfect steadiness; his two holes of the day (everything was not holed) ran to about 31 and 32. He had some bad luck in the afternoon by having several stymies left for him, but Henderson's putting was too good for him in the afternoon. The best of Oxford's golfers had, until the close of the first round, the score of T. M. Hunter, of Oxford, who went out in 36, and after turning 4 up, he eventually played three holes to the credit of his side, went out in 44 and returned 1 down thus 4 4 4 4 7 4 7 4."

This year, however, if we are to believe salesmen and butchers, trade was a fair knock out and no mistake. However, both these authorities now agree in saying that things are looking better and that the worst is over. The alleged war is getting played out, and the existence of the Spanish Fleet is now seriously doubted even by the most imaginative of Fleet Street war correspondents. So far as the war has any influence upon trade that is the cattle trade or general produce trade, it was long ago discounted. There might as well be no war for all the difference."
"18980622","QUEBEC CENTRAL RAILWAY A Quebec Line Which Pays Its Proprietors a Dividend The annual general meeting was held on June 6, at the office, Great Winchester Street, London, Eng. Mr. Edward Dent presided, and in moving the adoption of the report, stated that the gross earnings for the year ended December 31 last amounted to $1,000,000, being an increase of $60,537 over those of the preceding year. The working expenses amounted to $309,555, being an increase of $40,781. The net earnings were $688,088, being an increase of $119,776, to which was added interest on balances, etc., $2,830, and there had been written off some items amounting to $2,954, making the available net revenue $147,964. After paying interest on the prior lien bonds, $62,198, there remained a balance of $62,198, out of which a dividend of 1 1/2 per cent had been declared, and paid on the income bonds, leaving $13,000 to be carried forward. The percentage of working expenses was 15.1 per cent, as compared with 67.8 per cent for the previous year. There was an increase of traffic on the Tring and Megantic road traffic on the Tring and Megantic branch, as well as on the main line; the increase in freight earnings on the branch line was $13,479, and on the main line $71,111. The passenger earnings showed an increase of $8,672 over those of the previous year. The freight traffic was affected by the increased tariff on lumber into the United States, which led to a great rush of lumber shipments in the first six months of the year. This accounted for the decreases they had been showing during the first six months of this year. As against this, there was a better demand for spruce lumber for the English and French markets. During the year, 20 1/2 miles of old 56 lb steel rails were replaced with new 70 lb steel rails, and, as much of this was done in the way of renewals, after charging to capital an amount representing the difference in weight between the 70 lb rolls and the 56 lb rails, half of the balance $11,493 was charged against revenue, and a similar charge would occur in the current year. During the year, 40,000 new ties were laid, and 70,000 tons of ballast were used. During the year, they expended $58,146 on capital account, but against this there were sundry credits amounting to $11,703. As previously advised, the board determined to erect new machine shops at Newington, near Sherbrooke, and a larger engine house, the requisite land having been granted to the company by the municipality under certain conditions. The monthly comparative statements of expenses appeared to show unfavorably as compared with the corresponding period in the current publications this year up to April 30. They were charging out expenses for the new rails monthly, whereas in the corresponding period it was all included at the end of the year in one lump sum. The traffic was much hampered during January and February last by continuous heavy snowstorms. In view of the constantly cheapening value of money, the directors considered that it would be in the interests of the company to create a debenture stock or bonds to take the place of the present terminable bonds. The company had $1,000,000 of 6 per cent prior lien bonds, the annual interest upon which amounted to $17,500, and what they thought of doing was to apply to the Quebec Parliament, not for the purpose of increasing the amount of interest on their bonded debt, but to allow them to place it in another shape, providing that the annual interest should not exceed $17,500 per annum. In view of the maturity of the prior liens in the course of about nine and one-half years, it had been thought that this would be advantageously carried out by substituting a 4 per cent debenture stock, and at the proper time to give the proprietors an opportunity of exchanging into the new securities on terms. It would be quite optional to the bondholders, and it could only be carried out with their approval. With this view, the board would apply to the Quebec Parliament at its next session for a permissive bill. It would, without increasing the fixed charges, afford means of obtaining more capital, which the board saw good opportunities of using for the development of the property. The net earnings for the four months ended April 30 last amounted to $27,107, a decrease of $17,515, which was partially accounted for by the monthly charges for the rails and by the heavy snowstorms referred to. Mr. Joseph Price seconded the motion. In reply to questions, the chairman stated that the increase in the directors' fees was voted last year; and Mr. Joseph Price stated that the London office expenses only amounted to $200 a year, which included rent and clerical expenses. The motion was adopted. The directors were afterwards re-elected, and a resolution for reducing their fees to $300 a year was not seconded."

Towards the end of his life Sir Francis Drake, a true Devonian, became mayor of Plymouth, represented it in Parliament, and spent several years in developing merit, which was his by addition, though he was born at Tavistock, four leagues distant. During this period of municipal work he conceived the idea of bringing a water supply to Plymouth from the Dartmoor hills. Seven miles distant, as the crow flies, he found the moorland stream, the Heavy, and he cut a leat, or channel, to the town. In order to secure a gradual fall, he turned the leat in and out among the hills, so that, instead of being only seven miles long, it was full twenty miles from end to end. For three hundred years this leat has remained as a monument to his enterprise and has supplied the town. Every year the Head Weir has been visited by his successors in the mayoral chair and the corporation, and they have drunk to the ""pious memory"" of the great navigator in a goblet of water, and there the loving cup, brimming over with a stronger liquid, has passed from hand to hand, and honor has been done to the dead. ""May the descendants of him who brought us water never want wine."" A few years ago a heavy snowstorm temporarily choked the leat, and as a reserve means of supply a line of pipes was laid, and it was decided to spend £150,000 on a storage reservoir on Dartmoor. In a month or two's time the reservoir will be opened, and there is a proposal to abandon the leat and sell the ground. The mischief has not yet been done, but the fact that the suggestion has not been resented by Drake's successors in the Plymouth Council Chamber tells its own tale.

"18980913","The sentiment in the market was influenced by the snowstorms in the West, which were also material factors. The crop report, though bearish on the corn crop as a whole, showed sharp deterioration for Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa. This, coupled with the snowstorms in the corn-belt, was very clearly indicated in the weakness of Rock Island, Burlington, and Union Pacific, the mileage of these roads being in the region affected. There was a growth of a conviction that there is a large available supply of money, at least outside of New York City. Money rates are easy at interior points, and there is even buying of commercial paper in the New York market by western banks. The large foreign demand for wheat and the evidence of underlying strength in the wheat market in the face of the bearish Government crop report had some influence in the stock market."
"18980922","CROOKES' ADDRESS: Accuracy of His Statements About Northwest Soil Questioned To the Editor of The Gazette: Sir, Have you noticed the remarks of Sir W. Crookes, president of the British Association, in his address to the Bristol meeting? Referring to Canada, Sir William says: ""The fertility of the Northwest provinces of the Dominion is due to an exceptional and curious circumstance. In winter the ground freezes to a considerable depth. Wheat is sown in the spring, generally April, when the frozen ground has been thawed to a depth of three inches. Under the hot sun of the short summer, the grain sprouts with surprising rapidity, partly because the roots are supplied with water from the thawing depths."" What Sir William calls an exceptional and curious circumstance reads to me very like a mare's nest, but as I am not an expert, I suggest that you publish this letter and invite a statement of the facts from those who are. I know that in the scanty and more cultivated adjoining settlements in the extreme north, such a description might fairly apply, but that it is even approximately true as applied to the great wheat-bearing areas of the Northwest, which Sir William was discussing, I shall be marvellously surprised. However, the whole thing gives an idea of the impression of Canada which prevails in Europe, and which we ourselves are responsible for. To gratify our friends in Europe, we send them photographs of Montreal blocked up by some exceptional snowstorm or coated with ice. Our great immigration organization, the Canadian Pacific, with its exceptional energy, floods the country with pictures of snow-clad peaks and ice-gorged valleys and glaciers, and who can blame a specialist like Sir William Crookes for opinions entirely outside of his matter, which probably are a travesty of facts?

"18981012","ADVENTURES EN ROUTE We left Skagway on March 20, and paid six cents a pound for the transportation of our supplies by mules to the summit of the White Pass. I carried our collapsible boat myself, because I was afraid it would be damaged, and I was very glad I did, because nearly every other collapsible boat I saw had been so injured by the carriers as to be almost useless. But it was not always easy to scramble up the White Pass with it, and sometimes I almost stopped the procession. ""Burn your boat, it will be no good to you up there. You will never get up,"" and so on, until I remembered it was Sunday and determined to wait till the next day. In some places it is a very stiff climb, with a torrent of melted snow close by, into which now and then someone falls. From Skagway to the summit it is one long line of men and mules; the latter grip the ice with their sharpened shoes as well as they can, but the track is red with their blood. We spent the night at the White Pass Hotel paying 50 cents for a hard plank to sleep on, and a dollar for a supper of salt pork and hard tack. Here we came across a company of professional ramblers from the States, one of whom posed as a colonel, another as a judge, and a third as a professor. One of them took me for a greenhorn and invited me to a little gamble. I staked a dollar and won twenty. ""Ah! you have good luck. Try something higher,"" said the sharp, and was unutterably disgusted when I replied, ""No, thank you; I am not a tenderfoot. That is enough for me.""

A woman may ensure the health of her babe if she sees to it that she is thoroughly strong and healthy in a womanly way during the period of gestation. Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription cures all weakness and disease of the delicate and important organs that sustain the burden of maternity. It makes them strong, healthy, vigorous, and elastic. It banishes the squeamish spells of the expectant period and makes baby's introduction to the world easy and nearly painless. It rids maternity of peril. It insures the newcomer's health and an ample supply of nourishment. It transforms sickly, nervous, fretful, despondent, childless women into healthy, happy, helpful, amiable wives and mothers. Over 90,000 women have testified to the benefits derived from this marvelous medicine. It does away with the necessity for the embarrassing examinations and local treatments upon which most physicians insist. It substitutes certainty for the doubtful treatment of obscure physicians, who seldom correctly diagnose these troubles. All medicine dealers sell it, and Dr. Pierce will cheerfully give free advice to ailing women who write him. Scores of women who have been permanently cured of obstinate and dangerous diseases by this great medicine have permitted their names, addresses, experiences, and photographs to be printed in Dr. Pierce's Common Sense Medical Adviser.

have not agreed to relinquish it to the Cubans we relinquish it to the United States Thus crystalizing their reasoning and insistence the Spaniards bind debt and sovereignty together and urge that the relinquishment must be to the United States While this contention is keenly and vigorously supported it has not shaken the position of the Americans who cut the thread of Spanish diplomacy in the middle of the word relinquish by practically assuring the Spaniards that they need not cherish anxiety as to whom to relinquish but to conform to the fourth article of the protocol which pledges Spain that Cuba Porto Rico and other Spanish Islands of the West Indies shall be immediately evacuated Strictly the American response to Spanish diplomacy of construction and definition was that the words relinquish and evacuate are interchangeable and have the same meaning Thus three sessions were given up to silently meeting Spain's views and contentions touching the protocol pledge to relinquish sovereignty and title to Cuba and there is a possibility of two sessions more Havana, October 17 The American military commission held a conference at their headquarters today Rear-Admiral Sampson was present Senor Guanta secretary of the Spanish commission presented the American commissioners an official note setting forth the times when the next detachments of Spanish troops will leave the island It is reported here that many of the officers of General Gomez's staff have received leave of absence but it is added they have really resigned owing to serious trouble with their chief Ponce, October 17 By permission of General Guy W Henry Colonel John R Castleman of the First Kentucky volunteers had arranged to assemble all the regimental bands to take part at noon tomorrow in the celebration at that hour of the final and formal surrender of the Island of Puerto Rico to the United States The bands of the First Kentucky volunteers the Third Wisconsin volunteers the First Volunteer Engineers and the 15th Regular Infantry were to play the Star Spangled Banner in unison immediately after the firing of 41 guns from the batteries In consequence of the illness here however General Henry after a further conference with Col Castleman has decided not to allow a review of the troops considering the exhausted condition of the men but there will be music and other forms of celebration London, October 17 A dispatch to a London news agency from Paris says Today (Monday) the conference reached a crisis for the first time Judge Day presented the demands of the American commissioners in intelligent words He said that delay was the only possible object attainable by the persistent efforts of the Spanish commissioners to saddle the United States with the Cuban debt and would be tolerated no longer as the United States would neither assume nor guarantee any part of the debt The Spaniards replied that this placed Spain in a position of repudiating or reducing the face value of the Cuban bonds from 100 to 50 percent paying only half the stipulated interest on the reduced value Before they would adopt either alternative they would surrender to the United States the title to the Philippines This resulted in a whispered conference followed by a request for an adjournment in order to communicate with Madrid Judge Day said that President McKinley had instructed him to demand the entire surrender of Puerto Rico tomorrow (Tuesday) and the delivery of every town to the United States officers by midnight together with the evacuation of Havana on or before November 1 when the United States army would be at the gates of the city ready to take possession There was no alternative offered in the face of either of these demands and the session consequently was very brief The American commissioners have received dispatches from Washington indicating that the administration is irritated and indignant over the delay of the Spanish commissioners THE FRENCH NAVY A Mobilising

Barnhart had come to the latter place and got drunk after which, along with Wm Grace and two others, he started for Massena Springs. He claims that at a lonesome point, Grace pulled the horse into the ditches, knocked Barnhart into insensibility and robbed him. Grace, who is a Canadian, has been arrested and committed for trial. The first snowstorm of the season struck here this morning and is still raging. About six inches of snow has fallen, but the bottom is so soft that it is melting from below. On the Massena power canal excavation, George Hutnick, a Hungarian engineer, lost control of his locomotive and ran it into a train of empty cars, ditching several of them and tearing the cab off the engine. The engineer was under the wreckage and came out with his left arm badly crushed above the elbow, two ribs broken and a ruptured kidney. On the same works, Eugene Grifford, an Italian, was caught between two dumping cars and had three ribs broken and his collarbone dislocated."
"18981112","STATE OF TRADE Dun's Bulletin says: The trade situation at Montreal has been unmarked by special features since last week. The weather has become more seasonable, and winter and country crops have been reported in rather better shape, but the heavy snowstorm of Thursday and Friday will likely put them again in bad shape. As anticipated in our last report, dry goods payments on the 4th were well met, and one leading house reports that 82 1-2 per cent of their customers' paper was paid on that day, which is certainly a most excellent showing. In the older provinces, sorting business in dry goods is very fair, but in Manitoba and the Northwest, owing to recent unfavorable atmospheric conditions, a good many travelers have abandoned the sorting trip and gone home owing to the poor encouragement received in the way of orders. Woolen mill men continue to be well employed, and importers of raw wool report somewhat better demand, a fair aggregate of sales having transpired the last fortnight, principally Capes, and spot stocks are in narrow compass. The distribution in groceries is well sustained, and values show general steadiness. Canned goods are higher than for several years; western packers are reported sold out, and for wholesale lots of tomatoes and corn, 65 to 90 cents is asked between houses. Favorable reports are heard from local boot and shoe manufacturers regarding spring orders, and Quebec makers are also reported to be better employed. In leather, while business cannot be called active, there is more inquiry evident, and some good-sized orders for sole and dongolas have been placed. The demand for hides is quite equal to the present receipts, and values are steady at the figures for some time prevailing. Business in cements is quieting down with the approach of frost; receipts this week were pretty large, some 15,000 brls, but a good proportion of this was to fill old orders. Money continues plentiful, and the call rate is easy at 4 1-2 per cent. Owing to the abandonment of one of the largest freighters coming to this port, the Westmeath, with large supplies of glass for this market, which can only be replaced at enhanced cost, prices were again advanced Thursday 10 cents per fifty feet.

"18981124","FIRST OF THE SEASON Severe Snowstorms in North Britain and the Midlands London November 23 Severe snowstorms prevailed today over the Midlands and North Britain, and heavy gales are sweeping the coasts. Train and mail boats have been delayed. In Sheffield the storm is described as a blizzard, and in Manchester the street and railway traffic is badly crippled. A despatch from Brussels says that the Belgian coast was swept by a storm yesterday, and that great damage was done. A despatch from Amsterdam says that the steamer Montenegro went ashore in the storm near Texel Island, in the North Sea. London November 23 The fierce winds, accompanied by a sudden cold snap, have proved serious over the whole northern portion of the kingdom. The snow has caused many blockades and a number of accidents on the railways. Along the coast there have been numerous wrecks, and the lifeboats have been in constant requisition. The Channel traffic is practically suspended, and the hotels at Calais on the French side are crowded with travellers waiting to cross to Dover. NEW YORK New York November 23 There was a disposition manifest to curtail operations on the stock exchange in the early hours of today's session, on account of tomorrow's holiday for one thing, and on account of one or two depressing influences in the market, which offered obstacles to the successful prosecution of the bull campaign. The snowstorm in the West, with its obstruction to traffic and reports of damage to livestock was a discouragement to advancing prices. There was rather less assurance felt also that the Northern Pacific-Oregon Navigation imbroglio was sure to be patched up, and Northern Pacific stocks and others concerned in the quarrel tended downwards. Weakness in a number of the specialties, notably Tobacco, on reports of the character of the opposition in the cigarette branch accentuated the prevailing tendency. People's Gas dropped off at one time 1 1-2, and Federal Steel continued to droop. There was a marked falling off in the recent activity in Atchison preferred, probably the reason for the depressing influences for the other stocks. There was a very marked bull spirit latent in the market, nevertheless, and it turned from the centres of depression and from the region of the snowstorm to other specialties and the eastern railroads. The movement was more marked in the Coalers, and had its inception in the Reading issues. The buying of these securities was attributed to the banking interest, which yesterday advanced Southern preferred and which is dominant in Northern Pacific and has important interests in Federal Steel. How far yesterday's manipulation of Southern preferred and today's of the trading securities is designed to sustain the weak spots elsewhere in the common interest of the manipulator can only be a matter of surmise. Louisville, New York Central, Ontario & Western and a number of other eastern railways enjoyed their period of strength and aided towards the late recovery and the firm close at a level generally above yesterday's prices. Andrew McKinney & Co, members of the New York Stock Exchange, wire J E Fairchild, manager, U St, Sacramento street: The stock market was active, but irregular today, with prices towards an improvement. The delay in the reply of the Spanish peace commission was construed as favorable to an amicable settlement and a sharp advance took place. Manhattan rose about 2 percent, on rumors that a large short interest in the stock was forced to cover, and near the approach toward a change in the motive power. In the Industrials there was very little of interest. The market has been very dull all day, with the usual closing up of contracts before a holiday, but without any pressure of long stocks as the feeling is very confident of an early and satisfactory settlement of our affairs with Spain. All conditions point to a better market and an advance in prices all along the list. Money easy, 2 percent."

""Mighty bad,"" answered Pat, ""It is phtarvation that's staring me in the face,"" ""Is that so?"" said the sympathetic enquirer, ""Sure, and it can't be very pleasant for either of ye,"" A WEARY TELEGRAPH, A correspondent of Literature has answered the question which has been in so many minds since the publication of Kipling's ""The Truce of the Hear"" as to the meaning of Adam-sad, ""ad"" is Persian for born, and ""Adam-sad"" means ""Adam-born""; just as Shah-zada means king-born, Habib-zada, lord-born, and the familiar Hchehcruxnde, in the original ""Chamber-sad,"" city born, I wish that young Softleigh wouldn't stare at me so every time we meet, It's dreadfully embarrassing, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1893: 8 MARINE MATTERS, Snowstorm Delays Vessels in Leaving Port ANXIOUS ABOUT THE BUOYS The Guildhall Arrives Safe, From Antwerp River Boats Go Into Winter Quarters Shipping From All Points of the Globe, Three ocean steamers were unable to sail yesterday morning owing to the heavy snowstorm, Objects on the river could not be distinguished, The Norman will go light to Sydney, The Elder-Dempster Company's Montrose is another of the stormbound vessels, She has completed loading a cargo of lumber at Hochelaga and has cleared for Bristol."

"18981129","NEW YORK, New York, November 28, An animated buying movement broke out in the last hours of today's stock market, which carried prices throughout the list buoyantly above the previous high level and made the closing very strong. The demand was broad and better distributed than at any other time during the day, and the market looked healthier and freer from manipulation and less congested in a few prominent stocks than at any time during the current upward movement. Just what the motive was for the renewal of the buying was not very obvious. The market had already had its opening spurt on the acceptance by Spain of the peace terms offered by the United States. Prices for Americans had been sharply advanced in London on the strength of this factor before the opening here. The professional traders' rule to sell on good news brought a flood of offerings to realize on the opening advance by those who had been buying for several days past in anticipation of the Paris decision. The bears seized the opportunity to attack a group of specialties, including Manhattan, Brooklyn Transit, Sugar, People's Gas and Tobacco, and worked declines in them of from 1 to 2 percent. The Coalers, which have so often been the target of the bears, broke away from their associations and showed unusual strength on account of the belief in an adjustment of difficulties over the control of the trade. There was notable realizing in the Atchison issues, which held them back throughout the day. There was heaviness also in the Federal Steel stock, and at one time in Sugar. The reactionary tendency carried prices before the middle of the day back to near Saturday's level in some cases. The recovery began with the receipt of a number of strong traffic returns, notably that of St. Paul for October, which showed an increase in net earnings of $308,676, after an addition to operating expenses of nearly $192,000 over last year's expenditures, besides an increase of east-bound shipments from Chicago last week of 11,618 tons over the preceding week, and of 61,442 tons over the corresponding period of last year. Trunk lines felt the benefit of this latter statement, especially those of the South, the Northern lines feeling the adverse effect of the snowstorm. The aggressive strength shown by Union Pacific, Northern Pacific and the Oregon Short Line issues was rather convincing evidence of progress in the efforts to heal the differences between Northern Pacific and Oregon Navigation. Macdougall Bros, stock brokers, St. Francois Xavier street, report the closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange today as follows: STOCKS, American Tobacco, American Cotton Oil, American Sugar Refining."
"18981130","MONTREAL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, The Nawab of Dir, whose troops have been hunted by the Mad Mullah, is one of the few faithful allies of the British on the Northwest frontier of India. The Swatis, who are now in rebellion, gave a great deal of trouble in the Chitral campaign three years ago, and last year a rising among them set the whole frontier in a maze, involving a very costly expedition. They paid a fine of 20,000 rupees and promised most humbly to behave themselves in future; but they are on the war-path again. General Lockhart is hastening to the scene of the outbreak, and as he has had long experience in dealing with these people, it is to be hoped he will be able to bring them to their senses before the other turbulent tribes in the neighborhood are made uneasy. The Ottawa Free Press is among the Liberal papers which comment on the freedom with which the Conservative press points to the visible evidences of Canada's commercial progress. The Conservatives are giving the country a new ideal of Opposition policy, and the process is proving a profitable one politically. The small potato statesmen of the Liberal party, when they were in opposition, thought that one way of hurting their opponents was to malign the country, to exaggerate every evil and minimize every good thing in it. They were eighteen years in Opposition, largely because of their work in this respect. The Conservatives are a loyal Opposition, in every sense of the word, and they will not be eighteen years out of power. The port statistics show an increase in the shipments of grain last season, compared with 1897, of about 20,000,000 bushels. This is the most interesting feature of the port's trade, and there is reason for hoping that the increase will be permanent. The larger ships which all the lines running to Montreal are making use of are an important aid to the increase of its marine business, and next year more of them than ever will be here. There is now hardly an important European port between which and Canada the development of a trade is practicable that is not reached by direct steamship line from Montreal, and each connection is a means of drawing hither both import and export freight. The Witness prints a letter from one of the deputy-returning officers at the recent plebiscite, charging the returning officer for his division with attempting to rob him of part of his legal fee. The charge is directed against one of the returning officers for one of the counties of the Island of Montreal. It is definite enough to set people guessing, and indefinite enough to leave a number of innocent people under an unpleasant accusation. The charge ought to be made definite, and the names of accuser and accused published. It is too serious an accusation to be left anonymous, and dropped when the kicker has got his money. The Washington correspondent of the Toronto Globe says public opinion at the United States capital is perfectly indifferent as to Canada; the governing classes at the United States capital know nothing about us, and do not want to know. The United States people are plainly very ignorant beings. They do not, it is equally plain, read Canadian Liberal papers. Otherwise they would understand that Canada was the home of the great Laurier, who, at the Jubilee of 1897, shone a bigger man than even old John Bull. Montreal is not the only great municipality on this continent with unspeakable streets. The tremendous snowstorm which struck New York last Saturday paralyzed the street cleaning department, and many of the streets are still blocked. This was not the fault of the department, but of the municipal assembly, which has delayed too long the letting of the contract for removal of snow from the streets. And now the New Yorkers wish they had not gone back on municipal reform. One of the Quebec district Liberal papers is inquiring as to the cause of the discontent in the Laurier party. Down about Quebec it seems to be that there are not as many offices to give out as there were made promises of office. It is a mean reason, and the parading of it is one of the things that are disgusting people with the present outfit at Ottawa, and all connected with it. In violation of the Allen Labor Act Mr. Mutuck has brought New York designers to Ottawa to get out the Imperial penny postage stamp. Instead of that repudiation motto about this being the greatest Empire the world has ever seen, the postmaster-general on his new stamp should inscribe the motto, signed in New York. La Patrie, the Liberal party organ in Montreal, criticizes for at Sir Wilfrid Laurier's instigation, seems to doubt the wisdom of A. Wilfrid's buying cars and locomotives for the Intercolonial Railway and Philadelphia. Whatever it is, the Minister of Railways is flinching; he is not making votes for his party by his policy. The payment of $8,600,000 for the Philippines is a feature of the peace arrangements that United States opinion is not very much approval of. It appears to be that Dowry's court is going to Don’t forget THE SHIPPING. It had a busy season in 1898."

Biddeford, Me, December 5 The outer end of the ocean pier at Old Orchard was carried away during last night's storm. A section one hundred and fifty feet long was wrecked, carrying with it the big pavilion at the end occupied as a dance hall and restaurant. The wreckage came ashore on the beach a short distance from the pier. It is supposed that the wooden piles at the extreme end were loosened by the heavy seas, and were carried against the iron framework with sufficient force to demolish it. The pier was built last spring. The loss will be $2,000, covered by insurance. Halifax, December 5 A terrible southeast gale has been raging here since early this morning. It is not as fierce as the storm a week ago, but is severe enough to make coast navigation dangerous, and there will probably be fresh shipping disasters to report this week.

COLEY in The Criterion ABOUT PERSONS AND THINGS Cigarette smoking among women is on the increase, so man says. He should know, for a woman rarely smokes before another woman unless she is a genuine slave to the habit; then she doesn't care. Novices are very particular about their smoking outfits and think more of their cigarette holders than they do of their cigarettes by long odds. The best find, says the New York Sun, is to carry a small fine leather case, which contains a tiny holder, an ash receiver, and a match safe, designed to hold the smallest of small wax matches. These articles are made of pure gold and generously jeweled with diamonds, sapphires, and rubies. The holder has a mouthpiece of extra fine amber. Other handsome sets are made of gun metal, embellished with semi-precious stones, and are much used. The fur toques which are so popular this year have the rims and sides solid with fur, the wilt crown in many showing so little that it is hardly noticeable. Many of them are trimmed with either one or two ostrich plumes passing from the front to the back in the butt. They are usually of some shades of soft gray or brown, those indescribable shades neither light nor dark, but dull in effect, and which have new names each year, which this season blend with the fur of the toque, which seldom has flowers upon it to brighten it. In London there is a woman, Miss Penman, who has control over more than 200 conductors in the employ of the London Tramway Company. Miss Penman is the only woman in England who occupies the very unique position of superintendent of street railway conductors. She engages all the conductors, 600 all told, and the inspector; receives their reports from day to day, and superintends the numerous details appertaining to the distribution of tickets, the checking of the men's daily returns, and the dismissal of men when occasion arises. A pretty gown worn by a pretty girl the other day had the bodice of dove-gray silk, tucked lengthwise with fine tucks, the sleeves were tucked across. The guimpe was of pale yellow velvet; the silk below it was edged with a little shirred gray velvet ribbon, which ran down the opening of the blouse, which was at the side. The guimpe was appliqued with white lace. Around her neck the girl wore a string of big gold beads. Women who have been wheeling up to this last snowstorm have been wearing wash blouses, and under them long-sleeved flannel underwaists, which come for that purpose. Many young women wear the thick underwaist only when going out, as a heated house makes the thin waist quite comfortable without it. A handsome chinchilla collar has a straight round cape of blue velvet, embroidered with cut steel, for a foundation, while the chinchilla falls over it in points, the standing collar being of the fur. It is a handsome collar, though no one pretends that any combination could be more beautiful than a simple, fine fur. However, the combination is a fad of fashion and makes for change. Long chains of richly cut amethysts, olivines, imitation sapphires or turquoise and garnets alternated with imitation pearls, are worn by way of ornament with theatre waists and light gowns. From these chains dangle a single ornament, a big heart of the predominating color in the chain. The whole thing is absolutely useless, but it is swell and it is pretty, and what else is necessary for people who do not have to consider the utilitarian side of things? An economical evening cloak, which is at the same time elegant, is made of black satin lined with white, finished with a hood of white lace, fastened at either side with a rosette of colored velvet, and a high collar of any fur which may be at mind. A pretty white scarf for the neck is of the finest and sheerest mull, hemstitched across the ends and down the sides with a narrow hem. On each end, for a few inches up, is a pattern of conventionalized violets lightly embroidered, all in white. Among the new blouse waists for evening wear is one of yellow silk. A stiff revers of shirred adorns one side of the front, and three lovers' knots in yellow velvet are at intervals on the other. One of the novelties in millinery is colored grebe. Pretty toques are made of pale blue or pink grebe, and said to be wonderfully becoming. Toques of white caracul are another fancy. The fashionable color among the new flotto gowns is brown, with mauve silk linings and a touch of mauve velvet with gold and cream lace in the trimming. Little collars of fur are made sailor shape, round, and are fastened in front with velvet tied in a sailor knot; chinchilla fur, with blue velvet, makes a pretty combination. Cyrano, the new shade of ruby red with a tinge of pink in it, has much to recommend it, as it is said to be one of the few shades of red equally becoming to blondes and brunettes. For those who do not carry muffs, gauntlets of fur are worn to match the boa or coat trimmings. This is a London fashion which will no doubt materialize here later on."

"18981216","ELECTION JUDGE'S JOURNEY, He Travels 1,080 Miles to Carry the Returns to a Minnesota County, Duluth, December 10, The little angle that sticks up from Minnesota into Canada has an election precinct, though it hasn't much else. It is inhabited by a few fishermen, and at the last election cast eleven votes. It is no joke to get the return from such a precinct when the elements do not favor, and this year they did not. On election day there was a blizzard, with high winds and a severe snowstorm. William Zipple, Judge of Election, walked ten miles to the polling place, and with the other judges counted the eleven ballots that were cast. To him fell the chance of carrying the returns to the county seat, Bemidji, about 100 miles south, but with only one connection, and that across the Lake of the Woods, eighty miles, on the Canadian Pacific road to Winnipeg, 100 miles, and south to Duluth, 800 miles, and from there to Bemidji, 100 miles toward the starting place. It was in all a journey of 1,080 miles to get from an outlying precinct of the county to the county seat. Zipple started the day after the election with his eleven votes safely wrapped up, and the little steamer on which he was traveling had not run twenty miles up the lake before the sharp ice had cut a hole in her, and all hands, including the Election Judge, had to man the pumps. They kept at this work for about thirty hours, unable to make a head against the water, and in almost hourly fear of sinking. Finally, another steamer came along and everyone was transferred to it. The journey to Rat Portage was then continued without incident. In thirty-six hours thereafter, Zipple had arrived at Duluth with his ballots, but found that the road to Bemidji was blocked by wrecks of wheat trains and would not be open for twenty-four hours. He finally reached the county seat. Democratic candidates for Attorney and Auditor had been confident of their election by a majority of 7 votes. Zipple's precinct had given the Republican candidates all but two of the eleven votes, and the complexion of the county was changed. This Election Judge was ten days away from home, and traveled 1,080 miles, was once shipwrecked, and once delayed by wrecked trains.

"18981217","MONTREAL SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1898 3 IN A SNOWSTORM A French Christmas The first time I stood godfather was in very extraordinary circumstances indeed, said the old Judge. It was well on the month of December fully forty years ago, when for some reason or other, an election for the Legislature was to take place in the County of Charlevoix in January following. Things happened in those days pretty much as they do now: all the young lawyers and other members of the professions who had aspirations for public life were enlisted to assist with their oratory one or other of the candidates. Living in Quebec at this time, and forming part of the phalanx on our side, I was one of the first called to it. I knew what it is to carry on an election campaign in rural districts during winter time; but youth, you know, recoils from nothing when called upon to rally under the flag. I had never visited that part of the country, which was said to be very picturesque; and although the season was anything but favorable for a tourist, I made up my mind to undertake the journey, consoling myself that whatever the landscape might lose in peaceful beauty at this season of the year, would be more than compensated for by its wild and impressive character. My travelling companion was to be one of my old classmates of the Seminary, a promising young doctor, who was lost to science before he could give the world the full measure of his talents. We both remembered that another classmate of ours had just been nominated cure of St. Tite des Capes and we got it into our heads that it would be a pleasant thing to surprise him by our presence at midnight mass in his new parish, where opportunities for worldly recreation were not frequent enough to afford him many occasions for indulgence. A joyful evening en famille, between pipe and corkscrew, and then an interesting midnight ceremony in some rustic chapel at Tite was a newly erected parish after which a cheerful réveillon with wholesome tourtières and the traditional croquignoles, together with a few glasses of cordial to toast the health of our candidate, this constituted, you must admit, a simple, but rather alluring prospect. Our plans were quickly arranged; and we started on our journey with a trustworthy carter by the name of Pierre Vadeboncoeur, who knew the road well, and a lively prancing tandem shaking their jingling collars in superb style and trot. The sky was grey, but there was no particular indication of bad weather and apparently nothing to prevent us from reaching our destination before o'clock in the evening. The box of our sleigh had been divided into two compartments; in the one we had placed our ammunition for the election, that is to say, the campaign literature to reinforce our oratorical flights; in the other all that we considered necessary to supplement the cellar and larder of our friend who lived, of course, the simple, abstentious life usual to our country cures, especially in those out-of-the-way regions. I shall not give you a description of the country through which we were obliged to pass. Beauport, Ange-Gardien, Chateau-Richer, Ste. Anne de Beaupre, and St. Joachim are all beautiful parishes, but from there to St. Tite, it is an interminable ascent across the most tortured and desolate country one can possibly imagine; a dreadful road, plunging at times into dense forests, then winding up to bare summits, climbing by rugged stairways, crawling through fantastic gorges or sliding along dizzy precipices. Such are the Capes. This infernal tract is known as the road of La Mèche, and the road of La Mèche, that is the place above all others where the north wind doth blow, and where the storms of winter find full scope to unbridle their fury. Now, the weather, which had been reasonably fine during the early afternoon, had begun to change for the worst after our passage through the village of Ste. Anne. The snow, thick and dry, lifted from time to time by sudden gusts of wind, began to fill up the road, sadly impeding our horses. Consequently, we were somewhat late in arriving at St. Joachim, where we halted at the house of old Fillion, the keeper of a neat country inn, to light our pipes and shake off the chill. ""Messieurs,"" said the innkeeper, ""perhaps you will think it is none of my business, but if I were in your place I would go no further tonight."" ""What do you mean?"" ""I mean that Cape Tourmente does not bear its name for nothing; see if it has not the appearance of hiding itself for some mischief. Take my word, in half an hour from this, it will take no ordinary horses to cross the Capes."" ""Mine are not St. Joachim horses,"" said the driver, somewhat piqued. ""I have seen your Capes before; I know what they are."" ""Not so well as I do,"" returned the innkeeper; ""and I wager you my house, with all that's in it, that you won't go through the Capes this evening."" ""Well, well, we shall see,"" replied Pierre, lighting his pipe and tipping us a kind of malicious wink which we understood. Fillion, evidently an honest old man, understood it also, for turning towards us he remarked: ""If these gentlemen suspect me of giving interested advice, I have nothing left but to wish them good luck; my duty is done."" We felt the man was sincere; but to miss our Christmas Eve, our surprise for our friend, was too much of a disappointment. And then Pierre Vadeboncoeur seemed so sure of his venture. In short, we re-entered the cariole, and while we warmly wrapped ourselves in the robes, the driver vigorously lashed his horses, which sprang forward, snorting, through the drifts. The innkeeper had spoken truly; in less than an hour, we were travelling blindly over impracticable roads, in complete darkness, enveloped in a torrent of snow and sleet, of which no one who has not seen the same can form an idea. After having mounted perpendicular escarpments at the summits of which our horses could hardly stand against the wind, we had to descend into yawning gulfs, bordered by giant firs, where the poor animals almost disappeared in the whirling snow. Of course, we could not advance at more than a walk, and with nothing but instinct to guide us, our beasts, exhausted and blinded by clinging rime, trudged painfully along with hanging heads and heaving flanks. ""Suppose we turn back,"" said I to the driver. ""It is evident we cannot go much further."" ""Turn back!"" exclaimed the poor man, who seemed bitterly to regret his recent boasting; ""It is too late, monsieur; I am as blind as my horses; in turning back, we would risk missing the track, and with the track missed, I would not give five cents for our three skins."" The doctor said nothing. Our situation was becoming hopeless; since we could not retrace our steps, it was just as impossible to remain where we were, for the cold was increasing in a terrible manner, and in spite of our thick furs, we were chilled through and through. We had no alternative but to advance, to advance at all hazards. I was once in my life in distress at sea, with but little hopes of escape; but no agony of shipwreck can be compared to that which my companion and myself went through that evening, lost in the dark, solitude and tempest, half paralyzed with the wolfish cold, and depending on two wretched horses, which threatened at every moment to drop under the suffocating whirlwind. This last calamity was at hand. Suddenly our shaft horse snorted wildly, and stopped dead, shivering with terror; the other one had missed his footing on the edge of a declivity, rolling on his flank, and struggling in his agony, half swallowed up in a flurry of moving snow. ""That cursed Fillion has bewitched us!"" cried our unhappy driver, throwing himself at the head of the second horse to prevent him from being dragged down by the frantic efforts of his companion; ""if we have lost the road, there is nothing left for us to do, messieurs, but say our prayers."" While uttering these desponding words, the poor devil had nevertheless succeeded in unharnessing the fallen horse. But what next? Leave the poor animal to perish in the snow? It was first to be seen if the other was able to continue the journey by himself. We got out of the sleigh, and rather plunged than walked to give help to the unfortunate driver, who, in spite of all, retained sufficient courage to endeavor to save his horses. What a night, mon Dieu! No one can have an idea of it without actual experience. Suddenly, our coachman uttered a loud cry of joy. ""A gate! We are saved!"" And so it was; on the other side of the road opposite to the slope on which the horse had sunk, our man had come upon a fence; and, groping for a pole to help him in his work, he had put his hand upon a gate. A gate meant a house, and a house meant safety. ""Wait a bit!"" cried the brave Pierre; ""in ten minutes there will be someone to help us."" And in fact, to our great relief, he appeared a few moments afterwards with a man bearing a lantern and a rope. And hurrah! There was our poor horse on his feet again. ""Good-bye now!"" said the newcomer with an extraordinary business-like air; ""if the good God does not take care of you people this night, I pity you from my heart."" ""What do you mean?"" cried I; ""do you think we are going further on such a road? Your house is nearby; you would not leave travellers outside a night like this?"" ""Mes bons messieurs,"" said the man with the lantern, ""you are going to say it is not very Christian-like, but on my conscience and honor, there is no possibility of sleeping at my house this night."" ""No possibility? But we are not exacting, mon brave; a little corner under your roof, two chairs, a bench, the bare floor, anything at all, but in the name of heaven, don't leave us lost in the snow, freezing alive in the depths of night on this miserable road."" ""Alas! mes chers messieurs, it sounds hard indeed, but believe me, it is not my fault; it is impossible."" For a moment he took our driver aside, but suddenly he uttered a cry; ""A doctor! There is a doctor here!"" And rushing back to us he exclaimed: ""The doctor! Where is the doctor?"" ""Here!"" answered my friend. ""Ah! sir,"" said the poor man almost throwing himself upon the neck of my companion; ""you are a doctor! It is the good God who has sent you! This way, this way, quick!"" By the light of the lantern Pierre and I followed with the horses. ""The stable is to the right,"" called out the man to us, dragging the doctor after him towards the house, the door of which he shut in our face. ""I've an idea that there is no business for us inside there for the moment,"" said Pierre Vadeboncoeur, somewhat mysteriously; ""but as my fingers are badly frozen, sauf votre respect, I think you had better let the others manage their own business and help me unharness the horses."" The unfortunate man had, in fact, two fingers frozen on each hand. ""Ma foi,"" replied I, ""one must adapt himself to the times; to help one another is a law of nature. Come on!"" And while the poor fellow, chilled through, and moaning with pain, busily chafed his fingers with snow, I drew our cariole under an open shed, and drove our exhausted horses into the stable. Then, after putting a bundle of hay in each of the mangers, I turned my steps towards the house, accompanied by Pierre, still suffering from the numbness of his fingers. He pushed open the door, and I entered, shaking off the snow and frost which covered me from head to foot, and removing the icicles which hung on my hair and moustache. Hardly had I entered, and in my haste to get near the huge stove which hummed away joyously in the middle of the room, I let fall in a corner the heavy furs in which I was wrapped, when my companion de voyage appeared with a beaming face, carrying in both hands a small bundle, with all the precaution and reverence he would have displayed in bearing the Holy Sacrament itself. ""Mon ami,"" said he, bowing, ""I have the honor of presenting to you a newly fledged citizen of the world, to whom I have just given, in the name of the Faculty of Medicine of Laval University, a passport for the stormy voyage on the Road of Existence, without counting that of the Capes."" ""Is it possible a new-born child?"" ""Oui, monsieur, pour vous servir,"" said our rentier, much disturbed, but all smiles, ""a little angel of the good God; our first!"" ""On Christmas Eve, too! It is not an angel, but the Infant Jesus Himself."" ""It is indeed true; our little one is born on Christmas Eve!"" cried the happy father, turning towards the open bedroom door. ""You see then,"" replied the doctor, ""it is he, not I that God has sent you, my friend."" ""Him and you both, sir. All of you: You are all messengers of Heaven here,"" cried the brave man, drying his eyes with the back of his sleeve. What then? The baby was very weak; and, considering the condition of the roads, it was absolutely out of the question to carry the little one to church for at least three days. Therefore, to calm the anxiety of the poor mother, so terribly unnerved by her trial on this night of storm, the doctor advised that a private baptism be proceeded with. ""You will not refuse to be godfather, will you?"" said the father, addressing me. ""Godfather? Most willingly, my good fellow; I certainly will be godfather."" ""And you will name the boy?"" ""Noel, why not? We will call him Noel; it is the very name for a Christmas child."" ""Noel, that's it; it will go perfectly with my family name, which is Toussaint."" We arranged matters as fittingly as possible. The doctor officiated, of course; and I took my role of godfather most seriously, assisted by an agreeable godmother, the mother of the sick woman. I see you smile; well perhaps I looked rather grotesque in my new character, but if you had been there, you could not have smiled. When the water of regeneration trickled on the forehead of the little being, so frail, so helpless, whose life, by a most wonderful interposition of Providence, we had probably saved at its very entrance into this world, you could not help turning your thoughts back from this humble home to the sacred stable of Bethlehem. And this impression was so real to me, that it seemed as though I actually heard the voices of the shepherds of old, when our comrade Pierre, who had gone back to the stable to finish his duties, set his foot on the threshold of the door, giving forth, amid the booming of the tempest, the first notes of the old carol: ""Les anges dans nos campagnes."" We fell on our knees, and for my part why should I deny it? I felt a big tear running down my cheek, which I did not even attempt to conceal. But the ceremony did not end there. Pierre's journey to the stable had not had the interest of his horses for its only end. His Norman sagacity had smelt out the contents of the hamper he had seen us tuck away beneath the seat of the cariole; and making the judicious reflection that what was good for the cure could not be bad for his parishioners, he concluded with sound logic that the midnight watch at the presbytery of St. Tite, having been unavoidably missed, it would be absurd not to utilize the good things elsewhere. Upon this, as his frozen fingers had recovered their normal circulation, he had simply brought the hamper to the house, and when we noticed the fact, the table was already prepared for the feast. One can imagine the explosion of gaiety which followed. I have enjoyed the Christmas fête in France, in England and in this country, at my house and at the houses of others; well, the remembrance of the finest feast I ever sat to cannot obliterate the memory of that joyful repast, and the merry toast we drank that night to the health of this humble son of peasants, dozing beside his happy mother under the roof of a miserable cottage, isolated in the mountains and shaken in the raging grasp of a northern hurricane.

Strong westerly gales prevailed all along and there was a heavy head sea. The weather, however, was fine in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, but a thick snowstorm at Cape Despair caused nearly twelve hours' delay. Captain Thomas McKinnon, master of the ship, speaks highly in favor of the new route. He states that there was no ice whatever in the whole way, and that the harbor is the easiest to reach in the world."

On the stage they say that the ghost walks to denote when they are speaking of the circulating medium, Boston Transcript THE SHOVEL ARMY, HOW SNOW Helps to Solve the Labor Question, WORK FOR MANY HUNDREDS Snow Shovelling Quite Business conducted in Montreal. The time approaches when the man with no capital, but with two good muscular arms, will snap his fingers at poverty and will be duly thankful that there is plenty of snow in Montreal. For the day of the winter laborer is coming; in fact, it has dawned already. It is almost impossible to estimate the number of men who are benefited by the heavy snowfall in this city every winter, for many of these winter laborers work on their own account and it is impossible to discover how many of this class depend on snow for a livelihood. But no matter how many there are of him, he does a good business, and the best of it, from his standpoint, is that there is no capital required beyond the price of a shovel. The snow shoveler who works independently is a very peculiar creature, and he serves very well to illustrate certain laws of business. For there are snow shovellers who are more successful than others, and not through any extra muscular development either. As an old man who has shoveled snow every winter for years said yesterday: It's all in knowing how to get the job. Any fool with two hands can clean a sidewalk, but it is not every man who knows how to ask the lady of the house if he may clean it. A talk with this particular old man would convince you that there is more in the snow shovelling business than you ever dreamed of. He talks glibly of contract work, ""territory,"" ""maintaining prices,"" ""poaching,"" until you would imagine you were in the treasurer's office of a railroad contractor with millions behind him, instead of a man whose only capital consists of a snow shovel and a willingness to work. But he is a contractor, nevertheless, with quite a large number of matrons, and by this time he knows just how much money the snow shovelling industry is going to put into his pocket during the winter that is just beginning. He works in the residential portion of the city and does all his work by contract. Early in the season he visits a large number of householders and proposes to keep their premises clear of snow during the entire winter. The price is made for the season and depends on the length of the sidewalks and paths to be shoveled. When he gets the contract you could hardly call it a job; every detail of the work is agreed upon. It is understood that whenever it snows, within a few hours from the time the flakes stop falling, he shall have cleared the sidewalk, the front steps, the verandah, if there is one, the back steps, any path which may lead to the rear door, and if it is wash day, he must shovel enough snow away to insure the female who hangs out the clothes against the certainty at least of pneumonia. As he has a number of these contracts, it is easy to see that snow cuts quite a figure in this particular man's plans and keeps him decidedly busy if it comes often and enough. There is a large number of men who shovel snow on this contract basis, and it is claimed that there is a certain unwritten law of honor among them. For instance, it is not considered at all the proper thing for John Jones to go to John Smith's customers of last year until Smith has had an opportunity to visit them and apply for the work again. If for any reason a contract is not renewed, then another man can go after it with a clear conscience. Sometimes one of these men gets more work on his hands than he can take care of properly. In such a case he ""farms it out."" He hires another man to do part of the work and pays him just a little less than he himself receives from his customers, thus benefiting by the contract without doing the work. But the men who shovel snow by contract are only a small part of the big shovel brigade. Where there is one of the contract men, there are a dozen fellows who start out armed with shovels after each big storm and think they have had a poor day if they end their labors with less than three or four dollars as the result of a few hours' work. Among this class there is a certain amount of ""honor rules"" also. For instance, if one of them sees a confrere going from house to house on a certain small street, he goes somewhere else and does not ""poach."" These men have their pet territory. They seek for patronage among the middle class, who do not keep men servants of their own, but at the same time do not care to do their own shovelling. There are certain things that the transient snow shoveller is decidedly opposed to. One of them is the building known as a flat house. The shoveller shuns a flat because he knows that flats have janitors and that the average janitor does his own shovelling, which means one job the shoveller looks for the man who walks up and down the street with a shovel over his shoulder. But there is snow enough to afford employment to a good many hundreds of these shovellers, and many a poor fellow blesses the Canadian winter and hopes that there will be just as much snow this season as there was last. The snow, too, affords an opportunity for quite a number of men to obtain employment in the labor force maintained by the city. During the winter there are 80 extra foremen and 250 extra men on the payroll of the city department, who practically have steady employment all winter at a scale of $1.25 a day for laborers and $2 for foremen. In employing men for this work, preference is given to city taxpayers and married men. But when an extra heavy snowstorm comes along, the extra force is often swelled to as much as 500 extra hands, and then it is simply a case of first come, first employed. Then there is the labor required to get the streetcar system in order after a big storm; to clear the steam railway yards; to shovel out the big corporation. It all means expense to the capitalist and money in the pocket of the man who is willing to work. You see snow is not such a bad thing after all, considered from the standpoint of the man who works with his hands at whatever he can find to do. For the Diocese of Qu'Appelle, The Marchioness of Lansdowne opened a two days' sale of work, held by permission of Lord Brassey, at 24 Park Lane, in aid of the Clergy Endowment Fund of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle. Among those present at the ceremony were Bishop Anson, Mrs. Featherstonhaugh, the Hon. Mrs. Henry Johnson, the Dowager Countess of Kingston, the Hon. Mrs. Lowry, the Baroness Macdonell of Largie, Lady Maine, Lady Manners, General Montgomery-Moore, the Hon. Mrs. Montgomery-Moore, Lady Shipman, Mr. Wilfrid Williams, C.M.G., and Mrs. Burn. Cuthbert Burn, the son of the late Bishop Burn, presented a bouquet to Lady Lansdowne, who then officially declared the sale of work open. Bishop Anson, in moving a vote of thanks to her ladyship, said that the object of the sale of work was to help the fund which was intended to place the work in such a position as would enable it to be maintained without the aid of grants from missionary and other societies. He spoke of the needs of the diocese, mentioning that they particularly wanted funds for the building of new churches and for the maintenance of the clergy, in consequence of the reduced grants received from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. General Montgomery-Moore seconded the motion, which was agreed to. A vote of thanks was also passed to Lord Brassey. The sale of work was under the superintendence of Mrs. Burn, who presided at one of the stalls. Instrumental music was provided at intervals.

"18990107","NORWAY AND SWEDEN: Relations Continue Strained and War is Not Unlikely, Christiania, January. Norway and Sweden continue in a state of dissension that makes a war between the two countries not unlikely. The matter was aggravated the first of the year when Norway removed her flag minus the emblem, which signifies her union with Sweden. The Norwegians thirst for independence and it is stated the radicals have already taken steps to secure this by secretly alienating the Norwegian in the Joint army from Sweden. Both sides continue to strengthen their defenses. Norway's chief grievance is a clause in the constitution which makes a minister, who is alone responsible to the Swedish Riksdag, the real director of the foreign affairs of both countries. The Swedish grievance is that Norway, while taking advantage of antiquated laws, contributes few more men to the Scandinavian army than she did in 1914, about 10,000, while Sweden gives 100,000. Moderators suggest as a compromise that a Norwegian minister be given equal voice in foreign matters with the Swedish minister and that Norway increase her quota to the army. New York, January. August Reymert, special agent of the Krag-Jorgensen Arms Company, arrived here yesterday on the White Star line steamer Majestic. He said that he had been in Norway, and that he had filed with the Government of Norway, plans for the manufacture of four 15-centimeter breech-loading rifles.

The sweepers and several other cars will be kept going all night."
"18990109","Snowstorm Revives a Drooping Business TRAINS SLIGHTLY DELAYED Street Car Lines Pound Active for All Their Giant Snow Sweepers, Montreal has been visited with a snowstorm, and fortunately, she has received little or no damage. It started on Friday night, and owing to the slippery state of the sidewalks, pedestrians were compelled for safety's sake to walk in the middle of the road. As the flakes got larger and more profuse, the wind also increased, until at midnight there was a half gale blowing. The velocity of the wind at times was so great that people who wished to turn a corner were compelled to make a herculean effort if they wished to succeed. It made the carters feel happy, and assuredly more courteous. It was predicted that a snowstorm would happen about the New Year, and as each day passed by and no snow arrived, the men were so grievously disappointed that the majority placed their sleighs in the stables and reverted to the wheeled vehicles. A carter told a Gazette reporter last night that the snow had not come a bit too soon, for business during the holidays was so bad that they had not made enough to defray expenses. They, however, reaped a good harvest on Saturday, especially at the close of the theatrical performances, very few sleighs going away without a load. It also made the hearts of the snowshoe men feel glad. As soon as the secretaries of the several clubs discovered that the beautiful snow had come to remain, they at once issued notices to their members to prepare for regular tramps. The members of St. George's Snowshoe Club have extended an invitation to the members of the ""Old Tuque Bleue"" to join them in a union tramp and entertainment at their clubhouse tomorrow night, and a jolly time is predicted. Among those who do not look with favor upon snowstorms are the Street Railway officials. Although they carry a larger number of passengers, their service is greatly impeded, and the extra expense of running the snowplows and sweepers cuts deeply into the profits. The sweepers are a wonderful invention. Instead of carrying everything before them, they viciously cast everything to the side, with the result that the tracks are clear, but the bank is a great menace to those who drive rigs, and the bumps that one is apt to receive while driving over these innocent banks of snow are not soon forgotten. The importance of these snow sweepers has made many a driver who has the reputation of being a brave man, on seeing a sweeper approaching, suddenly remember that he had a business call on a side street. The sweeper makes it also bad for the passengers. The latter wait patiently for perhaps six minutes for a car at a corner of a street. They signal the motorman to stop, and the latter makes a great effort to oblige, but the rails are so slippery that the car refuses to stop until the wheels have propelled it about fifty yards past the corner. Then there is a frantic run to catch the car, and the half-winded passenger at once begins to abuse the conductor. The conductor, however, being accustomed to such little matters as ""rail down,"" remains as mute as a sphinx, and pacifies the irritated passenger by calmly asking for his fare. The storm had a delaying effect on some of the incoming trains on Saturday night. At the Windsor station, the Vancouver train, which was due at 6:23, did not arrive until midnight, and the New York train, due at 9:20, was an hour late. At the Grand Trunk depot, the Intercolonial train from Campbellton, due at 10:10, was three hours late, and the Intercolonial from Riviere du Loup, due at 10:20, was an hour late. There were no accidents from the storm reported, and the telegraph officials report that their wires had sustained no damage. B. Taylor, so many of whom preceded him to the undiscovered country. To sum his sterling worth in one brief line, ""And honest truth with well-earned praise combine, The Spartan epitaph reversed must be His country had no worthier son than he."" Funeral of Mr. Dalglish The funeral of Mr. Robert Dalglish took place on Friday, at 2 p.m., from his late residence, 86 Mackay street, and, notwithstanding the prevalence of a driving snowstorm, was attended by a very large number of the leading men of the city, with whom the deceased had long been on terms of great intimacy, and whose respect, confidence and goodwill he enjoyed in the fullest degree. The body was taken to the Church of St. James the Apostle, where an impressive service was held, Canon Ellegood and the assistant rector officiating. At its conclusion, the cortege reformed and proceeded up Bishop street, where many took sleighs and accompanied the remains to their last resting place at Mount Royal Cemetery. Among those who were present were Thomas Davidson, W. Wainwright, of the Grand Trunk Railway, who called upon Mr. Tarte and informally talked over with him the proposed Toronto-Collingwood line. It is too early yet to discuss definite proposals, but the prospect is that the scheme will rapidly assume practical form. Instead of diverging to Allendale, as is now done, the new road would have to be built as a straight line between Toronto and Collingwood. The idea of the Grand Trunk is that the traffic, upon reaching Toronto, might be divided, a portion being there transferred to vessels for transportation to Montreal, and a portion being taken direct by the main line of railway to that city. No doubt a question of subsidy would have to be considered if the construction of a new line were to be undertaken. The argument which will likely be advanced in support of the application will be that the new line would reserve to Canada a large amount of traffic that would otherwise go by way of the lakes to Buffalo, and that it would therefore be a work that would generally benefit the country. DECEMBER WEATHER Temperature Generally Below the Average During the Month The Dominion Meteorological Service weather chart for December says: The temperature was a little below average in British Columbia and throughout Ontario, except in the extreme eastern portion, where no damage was just maintained; in all the remaining portions of the Dominion it was above average, the excess being particularly marked in the Northwest Territories, and strikingly so in northern Alberta, where Edmonton reports as much as 11 degrees above average. In eastern Canada, Quebec reports the greatest amount above average, namely 3 degrees, and Halifax, Sydney and Charlottetown each give an excess of 2 degrees. The interior portion of the Lower Lake region gives the greatest general amount below average, Brantford and Lucknow each reporting a deficiency of 3 degrees. In the western and southwestern portions of the Lower Lakes region, also from the eastern portion of Lake Superior to about the Ottawa River and embracing the Georgian Bay district in Cape Breton, it was also above average, but seemingly local, whilst in all other portions of Canada it was below average, especially in the province of Quebec and over Vancouver Island. In the former province, there occurred at Quebec a deficiency of 1.5 inches, and at Father Point, 1.8 inches; Victoria in Vancouver Island records 4 inches less than average. In nearly all parts of the Dominion, the precipitation was largely snow, and in Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritime Provinces, some heavy falls occurred. The snowstorm of the 4th and 6th over Ontario was exceptionally heavy. During this storm, Orangeville reports that 28 inches fell, and Collingwood 24 inches. The snowfall during the month in the immediate neighborhood of Owen Sound was phenomenally heavy, the total fall at Owen Sound being reported as 8 feet 5 inches. In Quebec, the weather during December was stormy, and comparatively mild. The temperature was recorded on the 25th at Quebec. A strong northeast gale occurred on the 5th, with a maximum velocity of 62 miles per hour, snow fell nearly every day during the month, yet precipitation is under the average. Snow on the ground at the end of the month was five inches. At Richmond, the snow was from four to five inches in depth on the 31st, and teams have been crossing the river since the 28th.

The main portion of the Battalion will parade at the Armory at a quarter past eight o'clock, under Major Hamilton, and while it is said that the Cote des Neiges road will be their route, the knowing ones smile knowingly. The plans for the enemy have been well and thoroughly thought out. Representatives of both parties have been over the grounds, and rough sketches have been made, and timely hints thrown out to those interested on each side.

"18990209","W, but the delegate encountered a terrible snowstorm on their way to the morning meeting. The snow made the streets almost impassable. President Potter called the National Assembly to order for the twentieth time, soon after 10 o'clock, and then spoke on the benefits of good roads, turning the meeting over to the guidance of Richmond Parsons. Dr. Mendenhall made the address of the morning. He said it now was about ten years since the agitation for good roads began. Directly they had proved to be of great benefit by reason of the greatly enhanced hauling power of those who used them for heavy traffic. In some instances the cost of hauling a ton a mile had been reduced to less than one-quarter what it was before. The value of farms adjacent to the improved roads had been very decidedly increased and property had been made saleable at a good price which would have brought little or nothing. Despite the continued storm there was a large crowd at the good roads afternoon session and the spending was fully as interesting as in the morning. Chairman Parsons again presided. Among the speakers were Governor Dyer, General Hoystone, who told of the good roads in Porto Rico; Mayor Baker, Sterling Elliott of New York, and Conway W. Sams of Baltimore. February 8. There was an almost complete release today of the tension under which the rapid occurrence of events in the Philippines has held the officials of the administration since the first startling news from Manila Saturday night. This was brought about through the receipt of a bulletin from General Otis, summing up the latest results of the fighting he has had with the natives. The statement that Aguinaldo's influence had been destroyed and that the Filipino leader was seeking for a cessation of hostilities and for a conference was most acceptable and was interpreted as an admission he had realized his terrible mistake. It is entirely improbable that he will be able to restore anything like the same terms as were probable last week. No one here now knows just what General Otis intends to impose in the way of terms. Secretary Alger this afternoon repeated his statement of yesterday that he had given the General no instructions since the battle and saw no reason for giving him any. He realized, he said, that General Otis, being on the ground and having proved his fitness, was in a better position to deal with the situation than anyone in Washington. Should the General ask permission, therefore, to do anything, he would be granted permission immediately. Should he ask for instructions on any point, said Secretary Alger, he will be told to exercise his own discretion. In this view of the case it will be seen that no one here can tell at present how General Otis will act towards Aguinaldo's application, but the opinion is expressed by men here who know of General Otis' experience with the Indians that he will make the laying down of arms the conditions of dealing with the insurgents at all, and if that condition is met, of course, it will mean a speedy termination of the rebellion. New York, February 8. The Evening Journal says, under Washington date: The following dispatch has been sent to General Otis: Use your best efforts to capture Aguinaldo and hold him prisoner until further instructions.

"18990210","DAIRY PRODUCE, Cheese and Butter Firmly Held but Quiet, Thursday Evening, The cheese market remains without material change, and business continues limited owing to the fact that buyers and sellers cannot agree on a figure. Of course some business is passing, but it is restricted to goods that can be obtained at a compromise, whereas the bulk of the stock on spot is held for very full prices. Quotations range from 8.4c to 10c, according to quality. Butter rules steady, finest creamery selling at 20c in boxes and 19.5c in tubs, while held creamery is quotable from 18c to 19c. Dairy butter is unchanged at 14.5c. New York, February 8, There is nothing new to report on the cheese market. The heavy snowstorm of last night has interfered with travel, and but very little business is passing. Hold still the same confidence in the situation.

"18990214","ONE TRAIN CANCELLED The Delaware and Hudson New York train was three hours late last night on account of the snowstorm which is now raging in the states of New York and Maine. As for the Boston and New York, it had to be cancelled altogether, and the CAT3ED MUCH SUFFERING. Trains stalled, business abandoned and great discomfort was particularly severe in New York. New York, February 13 New York is almost snowbound. Traffic which was light today on account of its being a holiday will be necessarily so tomorrow. The snowstorm which began Saturday night today developed into the worst blizzard in the city's history. During the day a northwest gale blew through the snow banked streets at the rate of 25 miles an hour, driving the fine, icy blinding snow before it. Great drifts piled up in the principal thoroughfares and traffic on all the streetcar lines in the city except the Broadway and Third Avenue lines was practically at a standstill. The underground trolley lines were forced to stop early in the evening and only a few crosstown cars, drawn by four and six horses, made occasional trips. The railways running into New York are paralysed. The Pennsylvania attempted to get but one train through to the West today, while only one train from this city reached Washington. Local traffic has practically ceased. Disasters in the ice-filled harbors and rivers have multiplied. The huge drifts in the streets have produced a coal famine in parts of the city where it is impossible to make delivery. Coal, flour and staple provisions are rapidly going up, gas and water pipes are frozen in many parts of the town. The suffering from cold has never been so widespread in this city, it being estimated that at least 60,000 persons are in misery from cold and destitution. New York is the storm center, or rather the center of two opposing storms, one from the Gulf of Mexico and the other from the northwest. The storm which developed in the Gulf region Saturday night moved in a northerly direction. Another storm started on the Canada coast and met the one from the south over this city. The temperature is not so low as it has been, but the wind, which sends the blinding snow into great drifts along the thoroughfares, makes up for it. At no time since midnight Sunday night has the thermometer risen above nine degrees above zero. The ferry traffic to Jersey, Long Island and Staten Island is uncertain. Both the North and East rivers are filled with floating ice and navigation becomes hourly more difficult. The big Brooklyn Bridge is taxed to the utmost by the heglra from the ferries. The bridge trains are packed like herrings. The bridge is 30 inches higher in the center than the normal, on account of the contraction of the iron and steel work. Chief Engineer C. The coldest weather ever known in Kentucky was recorded today. At Louisville the thermometer only reached 10 below, but the state suffered much more. Lebanon showed a temperature of 39 below; Carlisle, 30; Princeton, 30, and the lowest recorded in reports from 26 stations was 13 below. At Paducah a negro woman and her child were frozen to death in the field. In many towns business has been suspended and coal shortage is reported from all parts of the state. The Ohio River is fast freezing. Atlanta, Ga., February 13 The temperature here today was 8 1-2 below, recorded officially. This was the lowest ever known here, the previous being 9 1-1 degrees. Street thermometers record 10 and 12 below, and this temperature, accompanied by a wind which showed a velocity of 13 miles an hour, made the cold almost unbearable. Great suffering was reported to the police early in the day and prompt measures were taken for relief. Fifteen and a half below is reported from Anniston, Alabama. IN BOSTON Boston, Mass., February 13 There regular old-fashioned snowstorm which has been raining throughout New England since early Sunday morning increased in intensity today and by night had developed into a blizzard with the usual accompaniment of stalled railroad trains, paralyzed streetcars and a general blockade. The storm, following the severe cold wave of last week, seems to have been a fitting climax for the severest weather that has been experienced in this region for many years. The main storm began at an early hour this morning and since then it has snowed incessantly, while the northwest gale at times reached a velocity of over 60 miles an hour. The steam railway companies wrestled all day with great drifts but by night the train service was practically suspended throughout New England. WE MISS THAT STORM Warmer today and still warmer tomorrow, say the Probs. Toronto, February 13, 8 p.m. The depression which was off the South Atlantic coast last night has developed into a storm of unusual violence which is now off the New England coast. A heavy gale has set in over the Maritime Provinces, attended by a snowstorm. Low pressure and mild weather prevails throughout the Northwest.

Ottawa Valley and Upper St. Lawrence Fair, a little higher temperature today and still higher on Wednesday. February 14 The heart of the town of Digby, the beautiful watering place on the Bay of Fundy shore of Nova Scotia, 160 miles from Halifax, by the Dominion Atlantic Railway, was wiped out by a destructive conflagration which broke out at 10:30 o'clock last night and was still burning at two o'clock this morning. The fire started while a howling gale was sweeping over the town, a heavy snowstorm having prevailed all day and left nearly two feet of snow on the ground. The inhabitants of the town turned out in the fearful storm to fight the flames and try to save their homes and places of business from destruction. The cold was not extreme, but the elements combined to make the night the most tempestuous and bitterest of the winter and there was terrible suffering among the women and children who were hurried out of bed and turned into the dark, and snow-laden streets, clad mostly in light and insufficient apparel. The fire broke out in the dry goods store of Letteney Bros, one of the principal stores in the town and situated on Water Street, the main thoroughfare. The high wind favored the flames, which spread with exceeding rapidity and the facilities for combating the conflagration, which the outbreak soon became, were far from adequate. The gale, blowing furiously from the northeast, swept the fire through the main street despite the desperate efforts of the firemen to stay it and before the hunger of the flames had been satisfied and they reached a point where the citizens could fight them with success, a score and a half of the principal buildings and as many more small structures were smoldering and smoking heaps of ruins. The Dominion Atlantic Railway station and freight houses, immediately in rear of Water Street, were for two hours in imminent danger of destruction, but by hard, determined work the property was saved, including two trains, one a through freight and the other a suburban, which it had been impossible to move on account of the snow blockade. At 2 a.m. the fire, having long before hurried through the principal part of the street and having little beyond in the way of important business structures to devour, seemed to have received a check at the Dufferin House, one of the largest hotels in the town. Both sides of the street were covered by the sweeping flames up to this point and at the hour named it was thought that the worst was over. The Dufferin House has probably been saved, as well as the Bank of Nova Scotia, but only a few more of the larger business buildings were spared. The burning structures include Letteney Bros' dry goods store; Jenner's drug store; Mayor Shreve's office and store building. February 13 The American schooner Lizzie Griffin, which left Gloucester on Thursday last for the Banks, was picked up off the harbor this morning in a helpless and foundering condition. She had encountered tremendous weather. When sighted the crew were at work removing ice from the vessel and had stripped her of about 15 tons. When she entered the harbor, she was iced up to the masts, her hull resembled a block of ice. The crew suffered intensely from frostbites. A hurricane accompanied by a blinding snowstorm was experienced on Thursday night, continuing all the next day and night, foresail and jib were carried away and mainsail split. The schooner was in the middle of the Bay of Fundy, great seas swept over her, and the crew expected her to founder. The boats were frozen hard and fast and the vessel was covered with a coat of ice over a foot thick. She was down to the rails and had the storm not abated, she would have sunk. Two of the crew were badly injured. Those who were at the wheel had to be cut from the ice when relieved."

"18990217","THE CATTLE MARKET Glasgow Trade Bad-Cattle Lose Three Pounds per Head-Local Trade Active -Prices Firm On Tuesday private cable advices were received from Glasgow reporting sales of Canadian cattle, es steamship Atcides. The market was very bad as the prices realized netted the shippers in some cases a clean loss at $15 per head. The Amarynthia has arrived out with a loss of 64 cattle and the balance of 48, Kurgo is badly bruised. The steamship Virginia, which sailed from Portland to Liverpool, landed her entire shipment of Canadian cattle, which was about 800 head, but she lost some 230 head of American cattle. Latest advices received from Winnipeg state that owing to the recent severe cold weather and heavy snowstorms experienced in the range country throughout the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, there have been some heavy losses of cattle which amount to as much as 50 percent in some sections. Mr. Ironside stated that his advices were that all the cattle on the ranges were doing splendidly previous to the cold wave, but since they have failed considerably, which means, he says, they will take two months longer to get into condition and they will all have to be moved at the tail end of next season. That returns relating to the carriage of cattle, sheep, and horses by the White Star line from New York during 1898 are of a most satisfactory nature. Out of 44,417 cattle shipped, only 25 were lost on the voyage, a percentage of 0.056; 28,038 sheep were shipped, of which only 290 were lost, a percentage of 1.03. At the East End Abattoir market this morning the receipts of live stock were 400 cattle, 25 sheep and lambs, and 60 calves. The supply of cattle was a little larger than on Monday, but in spite of this fact the undertone to the market was firm and prices were fully maintained. The attendance of buyers was large, including one or two shippers, but the latter did not buy as there was no suitable stock offering. The demand from butchers was good and, on the whole, an active trade was done. The best stock sold at 4 1/4c to 4 3/4c; good at 4c to 4 1/4c; fair at 2 1/2c to 3 1/4c; and lower grades at from 2 1/2c to 1 1/4c per lb live weight. Receipts of sheep and lambs were exceedingly small; consequently, prices ruled firm. Sheep sold at 1 1/4c to 3 1/2c and lambs at 4 1/4c to 4 3/4c per lb live weight. There was an active demand for calves, of which supply was also small, but there was some choice stock among it, and they sold at $12 to $11 each, while lower grades brought from $2.60 to $10 each."

Children Cry for Castoria. The Weather in California. A correspondent from California, writing under date of 10th February, says: ""I took a walk last Sunday afternoon down through the fields, and I am sure you would be surprised to see all the wild flowers that were in bloom, California poppies, buttercups, baby blue eyes, heartsease, and any number of others. And this was at the time when we were reading about the terrible cold and snowstorms on your side of the continent. But for all that we have had a very cold winter for California. December was very cold and dry, instead of rainy, and I have seen ice several mornings; but since the middle of January we have had delightful weather. The worst of all is we are threatened with another dry winter, and unless we get good, generous rains from now on until April it will mean ruin to a good many people. However, there is time enough yet, and there are lots of people praying for rain, of which there is a great shortage so far, and we live in hopes. What do you think?

"18990316","FURY OF THE STORM: Streets Blocked by Snow Last Night CAB SERVICE IS DEMANDAGED Belated Pedestrians in Outlying Portions of the City Experience Difficulty in Getting Home Montreal was battered by its severe snowstorm yesterday. It came suddenly and, despite warning, very few were prepared for the hazard in store for them. It was as much a surprise for the officials of the Street Railway as to the public. The everyday artisan who labors from early morning delights to walk home at night for the purpose of working up an appetite, but last night he gave up this luxury, and his sole idea was to catch a car. As the storm grew stronger, the rush for shelter became an epidemic with the result that many persons had narrow escapes from being thrown under the cars, which were following each other in quick succession. Later in the evening the wind changed to the northeast, with the result that the cars had to fight the drift. The whole of the east end cars were at a standstill for a few minutes shortly after 7 o'clock, but a telephone message quickly brought a sweeper to the scene. After moderate work the line was cleared and, with a view to making up the time, extra cars were placed on the service. There was also considerable drift in the west end of the city and the company were, at times, at a loss how to deal with the storm. Auxiliary sweepers, however, were telephoned for and despite the high wind, the line on St. Catherine Street was made clear. At Point Charles the lines were remarkably clear. This is due to the sweepers running on the Craig and Centre and Wellington Streets. They met early in the evening, with the result that the regular cars were enabled to pass Wellington Bridge without any delay. For upward of two hours last night the streetcar service between Craig and St. Catherine Streets and the northern section of the city via Bleury and Park Avenue was completely at a standstill. On probably no other route throughout the Street Railway system was the severity of the snowstorm more keenly felt. Everything went smoothly until about 9 p.m., when cars making the ascent of this hill, which in many places is by no means easy, even under ordinary circumstances, did so with rapidly increasing difficulty. So greatly was their progress impeded by the soft snow which clung to wheels and rails alike that it was only by dint of exerting the greatest energy that it was possible at all to surmount the hill. When it is stated that it took one car forty-five minutes, that is from 9:10 to 8:55 to force its way from the corner of Craig to the intersection of Prince Arthur and Park Avenue, some slight idea may be gained of the difficulties under which the motormen labored, and incidentally, the annoyance and discomfort to which scores of passengers were subjected. The particular car mentioned above met its first obstacle on the steep gradient just before Sherbrooke Street is reached and succeeded in attaining the comparative level above Sherbrooke Street after a performance which resembled nothing more closely than the space-gaining plunges made by the players in American football. How interesting this mode of progression was for the passengers can easily be imagined. After reaching the north side of Sherbrooke Street, everything went well just long enough to allow the passengers to gather themselves together, calm down and once more entertain hopes that they would get home in comparative comfort. But, alas! for their hopes; ere Milton Street was reached the car was again forced to succumb to the elements, and again had resource to ""bucking"" the drift, with so little success, however, that the passengers despaired completely, and were meditating facing the storm, when another car loomed in sight through the snow, and they hesitated, hoping against hope that with the aid of the new arrival they would make better progress. After a good-humored consultation, carried on in French, and at the top of their voices, between the conductors and motormen of two cars, about 60 yards apart, wherein they communicated with each other, and the world in general, and debated upon the wisest course to pursue, it was decided to hitch the two cars together and try with their combined efforts to make headway against the snow, which became deeper each moment. The ""hitching"" process was at last accomplished with infinite trouble to the men in charge, amidst the amused and suggestive comments of the passengers who had by this time resolved to see the thing through to the end, at all hazards. With the two cars and three others which had meanwhile arrived upon the scene and were also ""hitched"" on, and after a series of miniature collisions which shook up those who had the hardihood to remain on board, and who were already in many cases, shaken. A man has to have pluck to make a success of any calling. A man must have the backbone to take knockdown blows and get up again and again and fight on. Pluck and stamina are largely a question of good health. It only takes one knockdown blow to finish a man with a headache. It only takes a small setback to disconcert a nervous and shaky man. A bilious, headachy man goes into bankruptcy at the first embarrassment. A nervous man who does not sleep at night and gets up shaky in the morning gives up the battle of business at the first discouragement.

"18990318","T. EUN, Munich, February 1 - The pawnshops here do no business except in the months of January and February; that is to say, during carnival time. Then they are so overworked that they have to employ extra help. A Bavarian will not pawn his goods if he is hungry, or if his wife is, but to get money wherewith to dress himself out as a clown, and to pay for his entertainment during the great celebration of the year, he will hypothecate everything he possesses. Jewellery and clothes go first, as yielding the larger sums; thereafter come furniture, feather beds, and kitchen utensils. Often, after carnival is over, the Munich household is as bare of chattels as if a tornado had swept through. Even more pleasurable than the carnival, the Bavarian has no fewer than twenty-three holidays a year set apart for him, not counting Sundays, which are the greater holidays of all. Only one month, July, is without a holiday; in June, on the other hand, there are six. In Bavaria, too, a holiday is a holiday; the law defines strictly to what extent a man may work and what shop may keep open and how long. Aside from the designated holidays, there are really three moods in the year, the days of which it is called holidays; here carnival begins on Twelfth Night and ends with Mardi Gras; Galbafor, which is in March, ushers in Salvator (or bock) beer, and the Octoberfest, which is harvest home, bringing together the peasants from all parts of Bavaria. There are many places in the world where the carnival is celebrated, but most travelers agree that there is none where it is celebrated with any degree of enthusiasm, and that place is Munich. The Roman and Parisian festivities are tame and colorless compared with the almost riotous Munich festival. Then, too, the unique feature of the latter lies in the fact that the most joyous part of it does not take place in the streets, as in other cities, but in the cafes, which permits of a continuous performance, day and night, fair weather or foul. Munich cafes do not close their doors once during the whole carnival week; all of them remain open without a break for the last four days. It is a singular meteorological fact that the Munich weather, which is not especially good in winter, almost always becomes the most beautiful weather imaginable during the carnival—warm as in summer, with cloudless skies and dry footing. This, in itself, has something to do with the success of the festival, because when most people are running around in fleshings and low-necked gowns they are better able to preserve the ebullition of joyous spirit necessary for the occasion when they are not nip-nipped with the cold. The balminess of the air also is conducive to the acquirement of that thirst which makes beer the beginning, the middle, and the end of all Bavarian festivals—the most prudent and often a little slow. He does not begin his carnival in a hurry; he knows that it lasts a long time, and wonders how tired he is to get before it is over. Therefore, a stranger arriving at the beginning would have much to indicate what was in; he would make note of the fact that there were marked balls without number—not number—not as yet uproarious in their proceedings—and that everybody he met would have something of expectancy in his look. He would also remark that the cafes were a little more crowded, a little German band to wheeze out things. Then, as the evening wore on, he would grow conscious that the pace was quickening. This he would remark first at the Redouten, or balls. When these begin, each seems to be little ashamed of starting the ball rolling, and it asserts itself. To start with, carnival has its privileges; one may kiss whom one pleases without interference—although not always without scrapes; one may pull whiskers and knock off hats; it is even permitted (and this is the ultimate index of the entire freedom of the time) to lift the lid of a man's beer mug and put confetti into his beer. In a word, carnival has no restraint. Most American and English women go to see a Munich Redoute for the experience, just once. They always describe them as disgusting. If they are pretty, they are kissed, perhaps many times; but so are the German women, drinking, much stopping of service, some objectionable costumes, although vigorous, dancing. In no other country, perhaps, could such balls be given without the risk of their becoming disorderly; and that, in Munich, they never are. German women of the lower classes do not go to them; they prefer private entertainments, where the men do not drag them into corners and put their arms about their waists. It is in the cafes after the balls are over that the fun begins. As each masker enters, she is greeted with howls and cheers and the stamping of feet; anyone may go up and speak to her, and often there is no seat left at the table at which she sits for the man who accompanies her. Everything, however, at this stage of the carnival is still comparatively decorous. But there are few livelier sights to be seen anywhere than one of the larger Munich cafes at 6 o'clock in the morning, with perhaps a thousand masqueraders bubbling over with animal spirits, seated in it. And, more wonderful still, neither policeman nor the individual known as bouncer is in sight; Bavarians do not get drunk; they do not pick pockets and only rarely exchange overcoats; they are lovers of law and order as well as of beer, and their tempers are of the angelic mold. Munich is a city of half a million people. In the period of the carnival, averaging six weeks, there are from ninety to a hundred masked balls, in addition to a score or so of fancy dress orders, public and private. Among these latter, many are exceedingly picturesque—notably one where everybody goes in a leading peasant costume. Often there are as many as fifteen balls on the same night, yet they are always crowded. All this is preliminary and preparatory to the final week of the carnival when the staid people who have country houses leave town and those who haven't buy costumes to put in their Sunday best before Mardi Gras approaches. One remarks in the streets a number of small boys dressed as clowns, previous to like the children of Christmas morn, although in Germany, the presents come on Christmas Eve. They are the heralds of the feast. They display masks and gaudy raiment and curly wigs and all the things necessary for disguising. The cafes become noisier, the streets gayer, and every incoming train brings people from the surrounding country on pleasure bent. For many weeks the Carnival Society, which is composed of businessmen and artists and has charge of most of the celebration, has been busy arranging the details of the Masken-Zug feature of the festivities. This consists of more than a hundred floats, some very large and elaborate, and comprises 2,000 persons. Its treatment is looked after by a committee of artists, sculptors, and architects, and every float is passed upon as a work of art; if it does not come to the standard, it is rejected. Naturally, such an affair is exceedingly costly, and nearly everybody in Munich contributes something to defray the expense. The Government does its share; all the elaborate costumes and fittings come from the Court Theatre, and the bands furnishing the music for the procession are the regular regimental band of the army. The two great days of the year in Munich are Christmas and the Sunday before Mardi Gras; if there be any preference, it is in favor of the latter. A Münchener will postpone the most pressing business journey in order not to miss it. Everybody prays that it may be fine; and when it dawns and is fine, there is little left to be asked for. And, really, to anyone who has passed it in Munich, it is one of the most remarkable days in the calendar. On this day, anyone who respects himself and his neighbors must exemplify by some change in his costume that he understands and appreciates the meaning of it; if you but turn your coat wrong side out, it is sufficient. Most people merely wear a colored paper cap, but if a person has the money to buy it, a complete carnival costume is the thing. These costumes run the gamut of everything under the sun, and some others. Many young men don women's clothes of fashionable make, and they are so perfectly made up that it is difficult to distinguish them from the real thing; often people are startled to see a stylish young woman walking the streets with a cigar between her teeth. On the other hand, many of the women dress as men, and the effect, although not often so good, is sufficiently startling. The other favorite costumes are those of the Tyrolean peasant, with bare knees for the men, and those of courtiers. Of clowns and pierrots, there are always thousands. The children, even the babies, put on carnival togs, not to speak of the dogs. The regulation costume for a dog is a ruff about the neck and a small hat on the pate, and it is only they that look ashamed of themselves. The route of the procession is always handsomely decorated, with all the open windows crowded. As the procession passes by, the scene is nothing short of pandemonium. The air is filled with confetti and flying serpentines, and all is chaos. This lasts the whole afternoon, and when it is over, it looks as if there had been a heavy fall of pink and white and blue snow; while from all the telegraph wires and trees and house cornices, there are serpentine streamers flying in the air. The celebration is kept up with hardly a break all through the night, and the next day and the next, which is Mardi Gras. On the Tuesday comes the second procession—the so-called corse. This consists of several hundred carriages, decorated with flowers just as in the Flo Carnival at Nice; the occupants are all in carnival costume, with masks. This takes up another whole afternoon, and then, on the night of Mardi Gras comes the climax. The masqueraders have been in costume for the three days, and few of them have slept; nevertheless, they have preserved enough energy to make one think that they are imps incarnate. There are no balls on the Tuesday night, as everything must be over at midnight. Everybody, therefore, goes to the cafes, which are obliged to charge an admittance fee to keep down the crowds. From 8 o'clock in the evening until midnight, in every cafe, there is an unceasing riot. Most of the people at the tables are sightseers; the maskers, on the contrary, merely run around through the aisles, visiting cafe after cafe in regular order. For this one night in particular, there is no restraint of any kind. If you want to drink beer, you will have difficulty in doing so, for the moment you order it, your glass is pounced upon by a clown and drained before you can tell what has happened. If you wish to eat, you have the same experience. The maskers kiss every woman they see, without preference; there is no avoiding it. In the meantime, the air is a perfect snowstorm of confetti; bushels upon bushels fly in every direction; your eyes, nose, mouth, and ears are filled with them. If you protest against being blinded, choked, and suffocated, that is the signal for a general onslaught; a score of maskers will surround you and pelt you until you are either convinced that you are dead or else wish that you were. The scene in one of these cafes at midnight, the time for closing, is like nothing that has ever been seen elsewhere by men, unless it be like that after a gas explosion. Nothing is ever broken except glassware, but the confusion is worse than that of an upset box of picture blocks. No one is ever hurt, no one is ever robbed, and no one is ever in anything but the best of humor. When it is all over, everybody goes straight home, doffs his rumpled finery, and snatches a few hours' sleep before early mass. He usually has no money left and must economize for the week to come; but he is not sorry, and when the next carnival comes around, he is ready to begin afresh with more zest than ever.

"18990506","V Heroerx, ancubiuiii-i- Tn i-k iuli service, who was one of the prisoners, thus described the journey: ""It lay through a snow-clad country in severe frost with snowstorms and bitter winds. I saw at least 400 men drop down, taken as if they were no much offal, to die of starvation and exposure, or to be devoured by prowled round our column. Over each line hid a crowd of crows, many ravens, and vultures hovered, until he was sufficiently attacked with impunity. A pasha's army, which originally numbered 80,000, only 16,000 reached their homes. It is estimated that 60,000 Turks died in captivity. From the foregoing it is evident that the causes of the aftermath are manifold. Let me briefly summarize them: (1) The character and climate of the country in which the campaign takes place; (2) the insanitary condition of the army, and the inefficiency of the hospitals and the medical and surgical departments; (3) the food, drink, and clothing of the troops, and the degree to which troops are exposed; and (4) the individual constitutions of the soldiers, and the general hardships to which they are subjected. The staying power of an army in average health will depend on the physical features of the campaigning ground, whether it be mountainous or simply hilly, whether it contains alluvial plains, swamps, or unbroken forests, or whether it be checkered by frequent rivers. All these characteristics have been illustrated in the different campaigns I have summarized. Probably the worst for breeding deadly fevers are swampy and alluvial plains. Then as to climate, that depends in some degree on the season of the year in which the campaign is undertaken. A rainy season is dangerous because productive of the worst class of fevers and rheumatism. Great heat is exhausting. Frost and snow are prolific sources of mortality and impaired constitutions. What is called ""enteric fever"" seems to be the most constant scourge. The garrison of Erzeroum in the Russo-Turkish war numbered 17,000. One day in January 1878, no fewer than 301 deaths took place from fever; and the daily rate for weeks was 200. Nor were the investing Russians in better case. Gen. Melikoff declared that his army of 60,000 lost 40 percent from typhus fever and exposure. Gen. Kitroipatki, the Russian historian of the war, declares that after the third battle of Plevna, on September 11, the loss from among the Russian infantry was 200 per day, which, adding 10 percent for the cavalry, artillery train, and staff, would present a loss from sickness induced by hardships, exposure, and indifferent food of 50,000 in the three months preceding the fall of Plevna. In war, all armies have suffered from the neglect of ordinary hygienic precautions; and some armies have been all but destroyed in consequence. The improvements in hygienic conditions in the health army within the last thirty or forty years have been significant. The most elaborate provision is now made for maintaining a high standard of sanitation, but if the drain pipe in your house clogs up, what is the result? You must remove the stuff or it will decay and fill your house with evil odors of putrefaction. That's precisely what happens in your own body when you become constipated, and the poisonous matter is taken up by the blood, because you are unconscious of the effect. I know, slightly, two ladies, both of them amiable and attractive women otherwise, who are veritable walking charnel houses. Could I use a more expressive or truthful term? These ladies are so saturated with the poisonous effluvia from their internal economy that they are habituated to it; their sense of smell is blunted. I wonder how their husbands endure them. Both of these women suffer from constipation; their complexions are muddy and their breaths nauseating to sensitive people. I wish I knew them intimately enough to advise them to try Karl's Clover Root Tea, the most wonderful medicine I have ever known for the regulation of the bowels, purifying of the blood, and sweetening of the breath. My dear sisters, I wish to tell you that your health depends entirely on the state of your blood. Your blood makes you whatever you are, for through the blood every organ in your body is kept in repair. If your blood is poisoned by the waste material that is retained in your body because of your constipation, you are not being built up as you should be. Karl's Clover Root Tea is a truly wonderful tissue builder. It produces healthy digestive organs, allowing your food to nourish you, and induces sound, refreshing sleep.

"18990708","THE CORNSTALK BALL On the bell of a small village church in the east of Germany there is carved the figure of a cornstalk. The cornstalk has an interesting story connected with it. When the bell was built the poor people had spent all their money and had nothing left with which to buy a bell to hang in the tower. One day, when the schoolmaster was going to the service he saw growing out of a crack in the old crumbling wall of the churchyard a green stalk of corn. The idea suddenly struck him that perhaps this green stalk of corn, on what we call ""the snowball plan,"" which grows bigger as it rolls on, might be made the means of getting the coveted bell. He waited till the cornstalk was golden ripe, and then plucked the tufts that were on it, and sowed them next spring in his garden. In the autumn time he gathered the little crop thus produced, and sowed it again, till at last he had not room enough in his garden for the harvest. So he divided the seeds among a certain number of farmers, who went on growing the produce until in the eighth year the crop was so large that when it was put together and sold they found they had money enough to buy a large and beautiful bell. And they carved upon it the story of its origin, and the stalk of corn to which it owed its existence. A story of another kind is told of a bell in one of the churches at Cauenburg, Germany. A little ago, about A.D. 1513, a young lady of the noble family of Slekingen was returning home to Ladenburg from a visit to a neighboring village. An unexpected snowstorm brought on darkness before she could reach the town. At that period there were still remains of forest in the wide surrounding plains.

"18991002","L. Beaudry filled the mayoralty. Owing to the redistribution of aldermanic seats in Montreal, in virtue of the new charter which will find its first application in the civic elections of 1900, a state of affairs is created that, to the True Witness, appears at the very highest importance in as far as Irish Catholics are concerned, and it emphasizes the necessity for thorough organization. It advocates meetings of Irish Catholics in each of the following wards: St. Gabriel's, St. Ann's, St. Anthony's, St. Lawrence, St. Louis, West, Centre, St. James, St. Mary's, Hochelaga, and St. Denis. It adds, the Irish Catholics (on the mayor question) must either awaken at once to the full realization of the situation or else for all time close up their voices and silently bow down to the fate that will be of their own creation. In urging a just claim, the True Witness says, we have no desire to clash with the rights and interests of any other section of the community. All we seek, as far as the civic situation goes, is to secure a fair share of that representation which is the birthright of every class in the country; all we desire is to be allowed to do our part in the grand work of building up this city's future, to be permitted to enjoy a proportionate opportunity of contributing to the advancement, glory, and prosperity of our native, or our adopted land. We wish to cooperate with our fellow citizens of every race and of every creed in the magnificent enterprise of making Montreal the city of great commercial, industrial, and educational achievements. To gratify this legitimate and patriotic ambition, we cannot afford to sacrifice one iota of our rights in matters of civic representation! It then quotes Mayor Prefontaine's observations, delivered in February last, on the subject of a second term: It was honor enough for him to serve Montreal as mayor for two years, and as far as he was concerned he would insist upon the observance of the tacit understanding between the various sections of the community under which representatives of the various nationalities filled the office of mayor in rotation. It was the turn of the Irish people to elect a mayor after his term had expired. Then, in juxtaposition to this utterance of eight months ago, our contemporary states that when asked last week what his present attitude was regarding the Irish people and their claim to the coming term, he replied: I have no attitude towards the Irish people; I have been their friend and wish to continue so. It has been advanced that there should be a French mayor, an English Protestant mayor, and an Irish Catholic mayor every two years; this I do not admit is a fair way of dealing with the question, as in that case the French-speaking people, which represents seventy-five percent of the citizens, would only be represented every six years. It concludes by urging unity of action in securing the cooperation of that large and influential class of French Canadians which has ever been friendly towards Irish Catholics, and the sympathy of the fair-minded Protestants so numerous and active in the city and with the combined forces of these three great factors in public affairs, to demonstrate in a practical manner to Mr. Prefontaine that it is a dangerous thing to attempt the creation of a precedent the consequences of which must ultimately prove disastrous to existing harmony and general prosperity.

"18991020","AN ALPINE TRAGEDY: How Gallant and Skilful Mountaineers Died and Their Bodies Were Recovered, London Chronicle. Owen Jones was but thirty-one. He was born at Barmouth, and was a science master at the City of London School. But climbing had become with him a devouring passion. He climbed through all his holidays; he went where no other men would go. He had become easily the best rock climber in England. His feats in the lakes and North Wales are known to every member of the Alpine Club. I have several times had the pleasure of climbing with him, and never was there a surer foot or hand, never a braver, cooler head on the mountainside. As there will be many versions of the accident, I will give here the account which I have received from the sole witness and survivor Mr. Hill. He was at the funeral in spite of the terrible experience through which he had passed, three days without food on the Dent Blanche. The accident was no fault of Jones's. The party had reached the west ridge and were making their way along the rocks. They had reached a ""gendarme,"" or tower of rock which had to be surmounted. Furrer was leading, and in order to reach a hand-hold had been pushed up onto an ice axe, which was being held steady by Jones and Zurbriggen. Mr. Hill watched Furrer searching for a hand-hold, and then suddenly saw him collapse backward. He fell onto the two men below him and swept them off the ridge at once without sound or cry. Mr. Hill tightened his grip and looked away for a moment. Vuignier was about thirty feet from him, and he heard him go. He waited for the inevitable end, when, with amazement, he found that he was still there. The rope had broken just beyond Vuignier and was dangling down the mountainside. Far below him he could see the bodies falling from rock to rock with outspread, motionless hands until he turned away that he might see no more. Mr. Hill kept his nerve and saved his life. Perhaps it was the thought of his wife that nerved him to the tremendous task through which he passed. All alone he climbed the west ridge, climbed but twice before by fully equipped parties and reached the summit. Then he began to descend, but was caught in a snowstorm before he left the rocks. There he remained all Monday night and until midday Tuesday, roped to the rocks and jammed in with an ice axe. Then the mist suddenly lifted, and he climbed down all the afternoon and night of Tuesday without food, half delirious with exhaustion, now sleeping as he stood, then shouting ""Come on, you fellows!"" to the companions whose loss had become a dream to him until, on Wednesday, he staggered into the Staffel hut and at last broke his fast. Then he descended to Zermatt, and there Herr Seller gave him of his best. He is still rather dazed, but seems to have suffered no permanent harm. There is nothing to be said except that it was an accident. The finest climbers fail sometimes; Furrer gripped that hand-hold before he was quite sure of it. There is this margin of accident in all sports, and the best are liable to it. And these four were all of the best. When I arrived here, at 8 o'clock on Wednesday night, I certainly had intended to take a few days' rest before even thinking of mountaineering. But at 8 o'clock a telegram arrived making it certain that my friend Mr. Owen Glynne Jones had been killed, along with three guides, on the Dent Blanche. It seemed to me right that an English friend should throw in his lot with the gallant band of guides who immediately determined on a search for the bodies. And so it was that at 11 o'clock I found myself tramping through the pitch darkness, one of a long column of some thirty guides. The night was clouded, and there were very few stars visible. For hours the gloom was profound and only a few lanterns lent light to the long line of figures, tramping forward in silence, and winding in Indian file along the mountain paths. No one had any sleep, and some of the guides had spent all the day hunting for the body of the Tyrolese guide Keinstadler on the glacier below the Pigne d'Arolla. Poor fellow, he had come far from that quiet Tyrolese valley, only to perish in an obscure and trivial accident! We passed the lighted church, where his poor body lay, and every man removed his hat. This sad incident behind seemed to add to the melancholy of the taciturn procession, moving through the night. The darkness hid all landmarks. We passed Handetes without seeing the houses; then, as we turned eastward and climbed the Valley of Ferpecie, the torrent shouted at us out of the darkness on our right, an invisible enemy. The dim lanterns just lit the narrow path which skirts the torrent, but one slip, one moment of sleepiness, would have hurled anyone to certain destruction. At Ferpecie, the column halted and scattered to collect wood and nails to fashion trestles, on which to place the bodies. With admirable deftness the guides tore down fences and even took beams from the chalets. Thus laden, they resumed their march to the high Bricolla hut, each one with a great beam on his shoulder, like giants on the warpath. As we climbed upward, the glacier on our right began to grow more clear, and above it the circle of snow peaks, glimmering through the half light. We reached the hut, a little shepherd's cottage, at 3 o'clock, and the weary guides lit a fire and ate. At 4 the column resumed its way. Rain had begun to fall, and a dense mist was closing down upon us. But it was soon light enough to put out our lanterns, and courage came with the dawn. We rounded the Alp, and then began to climb the long, dreary moraines which lead up to the glacier. The guides went at a terrific pace. But it was good to be taken into this noble fraternity, to be accepted as a comrade and not as a ""climber,"" to be honored by a share in this generous quest. But the pace soon slackened. We halted on the edge of the glacier, roped in fours, and began to scramble singly for a way through the treacherous icefall of the glacier. We were mounting by the old approach to the Dent Blanche, up the icefall, now long since abandoned. The glacier was, of course, quite changed since any of these guides had last visited it. The ice was split and rent into every conceivable shape. We were surrounded with leaning towers of ice, threatening at any moment to fall on us and crush us. A great pile of seracs on the northern icefall across the ridge fell with a mighty crash. Away to the right we could hear the thunder of avalanches. But never for a moment did the guides hesitate. Steadily and unflinchingly they threaded their way between the menacing seracs, crossing broken fragments of ice, balancing between profound crevasses, now thwarted, but ever searching for a way. At last we suddenly struck upon the tracks of Jones's party, away to the north side of the glacier, close to the rocks. Here we scrambled up, half by the rocks and half by the ice, and then at last, after many hours, found ourselves on the great plateau beneath the long snow couloir running down from the West Ridge. There, if anywhere, they were likely to be. And there, high up among the rocks, we could just see, with the aid of a good telescope, some dark objects which were not rocks. ""There are our friends,"" said the guides. ""Yes, there was no doubt of it."" It was now 10 o'clock, and the sky had cleared. A party was formed and mounted the rocks to fetch the bodies. As they climbed, suddenly another army of men appeared below us above the icefall, advancing swiftly. They were the party of the Hermatt guides. They came on unroped, climbing fast. It was a magnificent sight to see this troop of climbers in their own element, a troop of equals, masters of peril. They halted below the rocks and sent up another small band to join the Evolena guides. There was a long pause, and then they all began to descend, bringing the bodies. I will draw a veil over what was found. Men cannot fall many thousands of feet and lie in artistic attitudes. They had died like men, and even in these poor shattered corpses there was a certain nobility. They were placed in sacks, and then began the terrible march down. The sacks had to be dragged down every step of the icefall. They fell into crevasses and were dragged out. The guides worked in relays, and every man was wanted. It was a task for the sons of Anak. Below the glacier we were met by men with a sledge, and then the work grew easier. But it was 4 o'clock before the Bricolla hut was reached and darkness had fallen before the bodies came to Handetes."

"18991113","T CAMPBELL Captain Baisley resided in St. John and had a wife and child here. Maxwell is also a St. John man and had sailed several voyages with Baisley as his mate. Point Lepreaux reports a heavy sea on, and parties on shore think the two men left in the schooner have run her ashore, and Maxwell has taken to the woods. The vessel will probably be a total loss, as a high wind is blowing with a blinding snowstorm this evening. The weather, as far as football is concerned, was about as unpleasant as could be. Ground frozen hard and a driving snowstorm are not ideal conditions, and it was no wonder that only a handful of spectators decorated the bleachers. They managed to keep themselves warm by the vigor of their language, which sometimes was red hot and sometimes blood-thirsty. In the matter of play, the teams were very evenly matched, though in the first half the splendid showing made by the Brits, with all the conditions against them, made them appear the superior team and justified their friends in the expectation that they would win out in the second half; but it was not to be. The teams lined out as follows: Brockville Position Britannia Richardson Full-back Rankin Jones Half-backs Brown Martin METROPOLITAN GOLFERS The Bowling Alleys Being Kept Busy Athletics - Turf General. The first point to note is that hounds taunted at all on Saturday last, for the ground was deemed hardly possible and pronounced by one and all before embarking on the special train for St. Annes, positively dangerous for jumping. But how inconsistently all acted upon this unanimous dictum will be briefly shown, for later on everyone was quick enough to scurry after hounds in as sharp a little burst as had decked the calendar of this good season. Of course, the country was not fit to ride on, much less to jump, but hounds went so fast that the fact passed out of recognition for the pleasant time being, and few suffered from the temporary forgetfulness. St. Annes was reached shortly after 11 o'clock, and here, as usual, a warm welcome awaited the hunt from the sporting members of this little village, among whom was Col. George Dowker, whose cheery presence and kindly recollections of past days with the Montreal Fox Hounds is never absent and always looked forward to at this meet. The Abbott wood was the first drawn and soon a fox was afoot, which led the field up over the hill to the open on the north side, for about a mile and a half, when just beyond the golf links he bent left-handed and made a large ring back to covert. Hounds went more than a fair pace most of the way, and obstacles in the shape of stone walls and timber came freely. Once again in covert, the pack hustled him about, while the field kept to the newly-made rides, until a ""view halloa"" on the east side proclaimed that the wily one had broken covert. All hurriedly pushed on through thick unyielding underbrush and over such gaps and fences as came in the line, only to find that he had doubled back. Here hounds were called off for a falling temperature made it cold work hunting what appeared to be a true ringer. In Paul Caty's spinny, the next tried, a bursting fox gave a sharp five-and-twenty minutes' run. The pack raced him easterly to nearly Allard's wood, over proper pasture and sticky plough, a fine gallop forward, which all could see and enjoy, and each and every one could take his own line. When near a little cedar bush on the aforementioned farm, Reynard came in view, not one hundred yards ahead. But dooming through this covert, he just evaded the gaze of the busy pack, and next he was gone. But ""hark!"" they have hit off his line again, and the thin chain of white, black, and tan comes shooting forth from the cedars, and the field is once more in their wake, struggling through icy cold water in the low-lying land, and over slippery ditches, ridge, and furrow. ""All on,"" hounds and men with heads straight for the distant starting point, which they reached, only to find that the pursued had eluded his pursuers, and the increasing chilliness which made it necessary to keep moving and not dwell in covert hunting about, saved him his brush. The belt of woods on towards Pointe Claire were next drawn, and when about halfway, a blinding snowstorm cut short the day's sport."
"18991115","C. Fraser reports meeting a snowstorm off Bird Rocks on the 12th, with high wind from southeast and heavy sea. In the evening the wind increased to a gale and hauled around to east northeast, while the sea got higher and the snowstorm became blinding. By 10 p.m. wind had veered to northeast, and snow cleared up. From that to Quebec, Quebec wind was moderate."

During the storm of Friday night, when twenty-five miles off Cleveland, Evan Robson, the mate, was knocked overboard by the foreboom. His brother, Captain Robson, launched the yawl boat to save him. The night was very dark and the wind blowing hard from the southwest at the time. The vessel dropped anchor and laid there till morning but saw no sign of the boat, and it is feared both men are drowned. The vessel lost all her canvas and drifted down the lake, and was picked up and brought in here this evening by the tug Snowstorm. The cargo is safe."
"18991124","NICHOLAS STREET, BOARD OF TRADE BUILDING, Bell Tel, Main 1141, concerning this product. It appears to have been generally successful where grown. Beans The bean crop has felt the effects of drought severely, and the returns are very variable. Where produced in eastern localities, it appears to have yielded better than in the western counties. Clover seed A very large proportion of the clover crop was winter-killed, and drought has so injured the second crop that very little seed has been secured. The midge has also proved destructive in many neighborhoods. Potatoes The potato crop is for the most part of excellent quality, having been housed in sound condition and free from disease, except in a few localities where the rot has appeared which in some cases attacked the crop after it was taken up. The plant has been remarkably free from injury from insect pests. The effect of the drought in numerous neighborhoods has been seriously to diminish the yield. Turnips The drought has seriously injured the turnips in common with other crops, and the yield as a rule has been light in all sections. Mangels The yield of mangels has been on the whole satisfactory, more especially in the Lake Erie counties. The quality of the crop is first-class, and the great bulk of it has been safely got under cover. Carrots Reports as to carrot crop indicate a fair production. In some of the western counties considerable damage by grasshoppers is noted. Fruit and fruit trees The condition of fruit trees and vines as a rule is excellent. The principal drawbacks are the effects of drought in a few localities, injuries from winds and recent snowstorms, and, more especially the damage inflicted by tent and forest caterpillars, which has been severe where spraying has been neglected. These and other insects, notably the codling moth, have seriously affected the apple crop, much of the fruit being wormy and inferior. Apples, pears, plums, and grapes in excess of home requirements were produced in some parts, although the early frosts spoiled the grapes in some instances. Owing to the wholesale destruction of peach trees last winter, the output of this fruit was very limited. There was an abundance of small fruits. But little mention is made of the San Jose scale, and curculio and black knot are hardly as much in evidence as formerly. Pastures and livestock Fall pasturage as a rule has not been good, the fields in most localities being dry and bare until a comparatively late period in the season, when they were revived to some extent by the heavy rains. Livestock are reported in a healthy condition, though thin for the most part in consequence of short pasturage, but there is no allusion to any form of animal disease. A great many cattle have been sold off as blockers at good prices, so that there is a decided scarcity of saleable cattle in many parts, especially in eastern Ontario. Hogs are plentiful and are being continually shipped to market; but present prices are low, and, if continued, will have a tendency to discourage hog-raising. There is plenty of fodder in nearly all localities for the winter's supply, especially of corn and coarse feed, but the hay crop has been light, and it commands a high price in many places. The Dairy The dairy industry, though injured to some extent by the dryness of the season, has on the whole been flourishing under the stimulus of good prices. In many parts, more particularly in the West, the manufacture of butter is gaining upon that of cheese, though the latter still generally maintains the lead as a factory product. Poultry The returns regarding the poultry industry are generally of a highly encouraging character. The profits have been good wherever fowls have received proper treatment. The egg production has been above the average, and prices have been remunerative. Poultry generally are in fine condition, and there has been but little disease of any kind. The Apiary Bees wintered badly, many hives having been lost. The season has been very unfavorable for honey production, there being little nectar available, and the supply of honey will be a good deal short of the average, and the quality is frequently inferior. Fall Ploughing The fine autumnal weather has enabled farmers to make good progress with their fall ploughing, as the ground for the most part was in splendid condition, excepting in a few localities, where operations were delayed somewhat by drought. Labor and Wages Except at harvest time, when there was a scarcity of help in many quarters, the supply of farm laborers has been sufficient for the demand. Yield of Crop Fall wheat, 14,439,827 bushels; spring wheat, 7,041,317 bushels; barley, 14,830,891 bushels; oats, 89,897,724 bushels; rye, 2,284,846 bushels; peas, 15,140,790 bushels; buckwheat, 2,203,294 bushels; beans, 651,009 bushels; potatoes, 19,933,366 bushels; mangel wurtzels, 20,898,387 bushels; carrots, 3,674,035 bushels; turnips, 57,878,390 bushels; corn for husking (in the ear), 21,673,234 bushels; corn for silo and fodder (green), 1,697,755 tons; hay and clover, 3,498,705 tons; apples, 19,126,439 bushels; tobacco, 2,241,562 pounds. None of the crops vary much from the August estimate of yield, except beans, which have fallen off over one-fifth. Of the root crops, potatoes is the only one going over the average. LIVE STOCK Trade in Cattle Dull at Toronto, but Prices All Round About the Same. Toronto, November 23. Cattle market today was about the same as Tuesday. Fat cattle were scarce; trade was very dull; sales were effected slowly. Receipts were light, being 25 loads, including about 700 sheep and lambs; 1,000 hogs, and 10 calves. None but good veal calves were wanted. Prices all round were about the same as last time quoted. Export cattle Very little was done in this branch. A few loads were sold at $4.40 to $4.65 for heavy cattle, and $4 to $4.25 for light weights. Butchers' cattle Some demand was shown for really choice butchers' heifers, but few were offered; most of the stock was common to medium and good, and sold at an average of about $3 to $3.40 per cwt. Picked choice lots sold around $4 to $4.12 1/2. Export bulls A few heavy export bulls sold at $3.75 to $4.25 per cwt. Milch cows were not so firm today. Moderate offerings sold at $30 to $50. Feeders were in fair demand at moderate prices, of $3.40 to $3.75 for heavy feeders, and $3 to $3.25 for light weights. Really choice short keep cattle sold a trifle higher. Stockers The demand was not strong; steers weighing 600 to 700 lbs. sold at $2.20 to $2.60 per cwt, and heavier stockers from $2.75 to $3. Bulls weighing about 900 lbs. held at $2 to $2.25; 1,000 to 1,100 lbs., $2.20 to $2.75 per cwt, and heavier weights around $3. Light bulls for Buffalo sold at $1.75 to $2 per cwt. Sheep and lambs Market was not brisk; prices ruled as quoted in table; surpluses of poor quality were left unsold. Hogs Small run, with unchanged prices of $4 for hogs, 360 to 200 lbs., market weight, and $3.02 1/2 for culls. The probability is that firmer prices will develop shortly.

They informed me of a plot which was being secretly laid by my relatives to entrap me, put me out of the way, and gain possession of my jewels and belongings. The countess ignored these letters; but going to Copenhagen shortly afterwards with her adopted son, who was ill, she was kidnapped by her brother and kept in an asylum for five weeks, receiving the most brutal treatment. The boy was put out of the asylum in a terrible snowstorm and left to die. He managed to crawl to the house of a niece of Bima, told where the countess was, and thus secured her release. She returned immediately to her work on the Baltic coast. The demand upon her time became so great that she purchased the Duen, in order to reach her people more easily. And thus the work of this remarkable woman began and developed, finding its beginnings in the little hut on the sea coast. From the Scandinavian harbors, the Duen, or Dove, found her way across the seas. Her owner's mission has been a thoroughly successful one. As the Duen quietly drops anchor in the harbor, the news of her arrival spreads from ship to ship, and in a short while her decks are filled with sailors of every nationality. Countess Schimmelmann's success in reaching what the Church considers, perhaps, the most hopeless class of people, the sailors, is due to three things: a strong and attractive personality, the preaching of a practical Christianity, and an intuitive and sympathetic understanding of the class of people toward whom that preaching is directed. In the countess's own words: The Bible has to be tried and tested through practical experience, then it will be found true, but it cannot be tested through philosophy and science. In the constant daily recognition of Christ, the perfection and power of life. The aim of my life is to do the will of Jesus, by ministering to the body and soul of the tempted, the oppressed, and the suffering brethren for whom He died. The Duen is a training ship for young sailors. It is also used as a free coffee and tea kitchen. Bible classes and services are held on board. Countess Schimmelmann not only receives the sailors from the neighboring ships in her own yacht, but visits them as well. She boarded last year a hundred ships. The spiritual condition of some of the sailors is astounding. They are the rankest atheists, not from choice, but from absolute ignorance. During one of her talks on Christ and His life work, a young Russian asked, in a very interested manner, for the gentleman's address. And it is this pitiable sort of ignorance which she meets at every turn. Only her woman's patience and belief in the power of Christ enable her to cope with the crying evils of the day. Countess Schimmelmann is an unmarried woman. She has three adopted boys, and her young secretary is the son of a Prussian general. Her life for the last thirteen years has been one of sacrifice and selflessness, and it is safe to say that no one woman has ever done more toward the bettering of mankind; she deserves the sympathy and encouragement of all American women. WOMEN OF AKBAR'S COURT The very last place where one would expect to find domestic peace and equity would be in a harem, that dim and dreadful prison house of eastern womanhood. Zenana life has been harrowingly described from every pulpit in Christendom, yet the mystery shrouding its existence stimulates, in the average listener, a desire to know still more concerning it. A glimpse of Akbar's harem may be interesting. It was the most extensive, as well as the best appointed, in Asia, and indeed, some authorities place it foremost at all times. It contained 5,000 inmates, and the premises were so extensive as to afford a separate room for each individual, exclusive of the general appointments, such as baths, balconies, assembly halls, and terraces. It was remarkably beautiful in construction and workmanship, one of the handsomest piles in Fatepur-Sikri, that dream of Oriental magnificence which Akbar solidified in marble. Abul-fazl, the Persian scholar and counsellor of Akbar, states that proper employment was assigned to each woman according to her rank, and as Akbar caused part of his priceless library to be placed at their command and these books were obviously designed for the exclusive use of the harem, it follows that the inmates were familiar with several languages, for the books were written in Persian, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Hindustani. The harem, writes Abul-fazl, was divided into sections called companies, each presided over by a daroga, or trustworthy chief, who, in turn, was subservient to a superior, always a woman of great moral excellence and ability, who was not only the ruling head of the harem, but a confidant of the Emperor and his dewans or ministers. The harem regulations were carried out with great precision and equity; there was no disorder, no open quarrels or discord. Each inmate had the privilege of bringing her grievances before his majesty, who never failed to redress a wrong, no matter how trivial, and to punish the wrongdoer. Each of the 5,000 women received a regular salary in proportion to rank. Princesses and daughters of indigent nobles received from 1,028 to 1,610 rupees; tire-women and serving girls from 2 to 10 rupees, and slaves still less, with chances of advancement conditional on good behavior and usefulness. The women drew their salaries at pleasure. They first made known their wants to the inferior treasurer, usually a eunuch, who made a memorandum of the monthly stipend and sent it to the Palace treasurer, who validated the bill and sent back the desired amount, always struck for the sole purpose of defraying harem expenses and therefore not valid for other uses. Its value tallied exactly with the currency of the state. Although the greater part of their salaries was usually expended in jewels and embroidered stuffs, a woman could, if she chose, set aside her allowance for future use or investment; for, in addition to the regular stipend, it was Akbar's custom to make quarterly presents of entire costumes to all the members of his noble family, and these garments were invariably of the finest material and workmanship procurable, for Akbar was extravagantly fond of personal adornment in women. The harem proper was very strictly guarded both from without and within by ""culmic women of reputation,"" who guarded the gates of the royal apartments; then by eunuchs. Immediately outside were Rajput soldiery, and lastly, mounted troops in numbers corresponding with the needs of peace or war. When the begum, or wife of a prince, or any other woman of rank, wished to pay her compliments to the women of the harem, she had to notify the eunuchs, who sent a written request to the palace officer. He issued a permit in the name of the Emperor, which allowed her the freedom of the harem for a stipulated length of time. It was not unusual for a permit to cover the period of one month, especially in the case of a princess or wife of a favorite officer. Some of the favorites, notably the Rajput princesses, the aristocracy of Asia from the time of Manu up to the present day, had apartments outside the harem proper, but within the walled enclosure, where they lived in true Oriental magnificence and comparative seclusion. They were privileged to enter the harem at will, and also to receive the harem inmates or not, as they chose, and they were also allowed to return out, always under an armed escort. All women were admitted to the prayer house at certain hours, and to the palace daily, shortly after sunrise. They were also permitted to attend musical entertainments in the palace. Special days were set apart for their attendance at fairs, upon which occasions men were excluded. The Emperor was a finished musician; he composed no less than two hundred modes, all of which the women prided themselves upon performing accurately. They kept themselves correctly informed of state affairs, and many a princess left the seclusion of the harem virtually to rule in her new capacity as the wife of a Rana, so that though jealously guarded from sight and social intercourse, the Indian women wielded a tremendous power for good or evil. Akbar owed his early training to a sagacious and most admirable woman, who presided over his harem, to whom he confided his hopes and fears and received in turn the counsel of wisdom, tempered with ripe experience. It was Akbar's policy to arrange marriages between women of Mogul families and Rajput princes of outlying provinces, by which he succeeded in strengthening the ruling power of the state. The Rajput men were model soldiers, fearless, upright, honorable; the princesses court beauties, proud, independent, high-spirited women, who made exemplary wives for his nobles. His Majesty's ideas of marriage were centuries in advance of the times; he disapproved of marriage before puberty; considered the consent of both bride and groom of equal importance with the parents; forbade extortionate marriage portions, and strenuously opposed polygamy and marrying of near kin. Neither would he permit the pairing of youth with old age, especially in the case of a young man and old woman. Widows were allowed to remarry, and sati-widow burning was abolished. Although the outward forms of alliances were arranged by court officials, the actual transaction was committed for the approval of the harem, for it is declared that Akbar never forced an unwilling marriage, but respected the reasonable wishes of all his subjects alike, both men and women."

At the Protestant House of Industry and Refuge, on Dorchester Street, 160 men received a Christmas dinner of roast beef and plum pudding. Messrs. Charles Alexander, James Moore, James Wilson, and George Hague were present. After a few words of prayer and gratitude by Mr. Alexander, the men fell to and speedily cleared the tables. On Friday last in St. George's schoolhouse, 120 bountiful dinners were given to the same number of families of the poorer members of this church. These seasonable meals were provided by the generosity of members of the congregation. A Heart as Sturdy as an Oak. But what about the blood which the heart must pump at the rate of 70 times a minute? If the heart is to be sturdy and the nerves strong, this blood must be rich and pure. Hood's Sarsaparilla makes sturdy hearts because it makes good blood. It gives to men and women strength, confidence, courage, and endurance.

A snowstorm, accompanied by a 45-mile gale, has been raging throughout Northern Ohio and over Lake Erie for the last twenty-four hours. The thermometer registered 16 above. In this city, streetcar traffic is badly impeded as a result of the heavy snowdrifts piled on the track. The trains of the trunk line railroads are nearly all late.
