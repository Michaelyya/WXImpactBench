Angela,0,0,18800116,historical,storm,"K, iTMO, asked if the Board thought the unpaid capital could be collected. The Cashier replied that under the Act MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 16, 1880, the stock of all those who did not pay up their calls could be confiscated. Mr. Baebsac asked on what basis was the valuation of the real estate made. The Cashier said the property owned by the Bank was on St Joseph and Seigneur streets, and gave a return of 5 per cent. The valuation was its actual worth. Mr. Babeiac entered into a lengthy charge against the management, contending that the Bank had not sufficient capital to do a profitable business, and that the shareholders had not been sufficiently consulted. A general meeting, he argued, should have been called after the Paquet defalcation, and also when the fusion with the Jacques Cartier Bank was under consideration. Had the latter been accomplished the result, he contended, would have been ruinous to the bank. Hon. Mr. Thibaudac replied to the charges made by Mr. Barbeau. The argument of the latter in relation to the circulation and reserve fund of the bank was absurd. As to calling a general meeting of the shareholders after the defalcation of Mr. Paquet, that would destroy the credit of the bank, for the shareholders under the excitement of the moment when rumors were afloat detrimental to various monetary institutions, would have caused precipitate action. As far as the fusion with the Jacques Cartier Bank was concerned, no measure to that end could have been passed without the consent of the shareholders and without an Act of Parliament to authorize it. It was not customary in the consideration of such questions for the directors to call a meeting until they had the scheme fully digested. Mr. Bxiqcx stated that if the fusion with the Jacques Cartier Bank was not proposed to the shareholders, it was because the directors of the Hochelaga Bank did not consider the terms offered by the Jacques Cartier Bank satisfactory. As to Mr. Barbeau's complaint that the defalcation of Mr. Paquet was owing to insufficient precautions having been taken by the Jacques Cartier Bank, he might say that the Jacques Cartier Bank's system in this respect had been the same as those then followed by other banks, and that the City and District Savings Bank had adopted further precautions in relation to its officers since Mr. Paquet's defalcation had been discovered. The Hochelaga Bank had also taken greater precautions and measures since that incident. Aid. Labebgi said that he had entered this meeting with views opposed to the management of the Hochelaga Bank, but since Mr. Barbeau's speech, he had altered his views and considered that the directors had done all in their power to provide against losses. He was, therefore, fully satisfied with the conduct of the directors and considered they should be re-elected. After some further discussion, the President made a speech which fairly carried away the audience and enlisted their sympathies and support on behalf of the directors. He sketched a history of the Bank, which was started in 1873, just as the years of financial crisis were opening, and gave the Bank great credit for maintaining its credit while other institutions were crashing around it. Four Banks, each with much larger capital than this one, had been obliged to close their doors, and yet the Hochelaga Bank weathered the difficulty, and probably with careful management would, now that the crisis was over, succeed in recovering lost ground and causing its shares to be rated at par. But to do this, its shareholders should give it every support by giving it the support of their business instead of transacting their affairs with other banks; and in this respect he cited the example of the butchers, who deposited their receipts with it as one worthy of emulation. Aid. JXAXXOTTX said he had a delicate question to ask of the directors, and amidst a storm of hisses, asked the directors if it was true that they made their deposits with other banks. The President was about to reply, when Hon. Mr. Thibaudean said it would be an insult to a meeting of the respectability of this one, for the president to answer a question of this kind, and the answer was not pressed for. The Cashier, in reply to a shareholder, said the shares of the bank stood today worth 87 per cent. The usual votes of thanks to the directors, cashier and officers were then moved and carried, without dissent after which Aid. Grenier moved, seconded by Aid. Jeannotte, that the old Board be re-elected. This motion was also carried unanimously, after which the meeting was declared closed. The new Board of Directors therefore consists of the following gentlemen: Mr. DISABLED STEAMER. On Monday last the steamship Plainmeller, Capt. Ford, from Newcastle, England, and bound to New York with a cargo of pig iron, put in here in a disabled condition. She left Newcastle on the 9th of December, and on the 16th encountered a hurricane by which the two starboard boats were carried away and the cabin was stove in. On the following day, the wind still blowing with terrible violence, Capt. Ford was coming out of the chart room, when a tremendous sea struck the ship and he was carried overboard and disappeared almost instantly. On the 22nd another storm arose, and the sea swept the decks, smashing the bulwarks from the bridge aft, destroying the steering gear and carrying overboard a seaman named Anderson. Next day the storm abated and the ship's course was shaped for this port. The hull is much strained, and it is thought the cargo will have to be landed to admit of the necessary repairs being effected. We are once more reminded of the necessity of a graving dock in a port such as this, lying near the track of the trans-Atlantic steamers, which, as in this instance, are frequently disabled and require repairs. It is calculated that had there been a graving dock here, the S8, Arizona would have paid in dock dues not less than 2,000, and the Plainmeller would have added a handsome sum. CHRISTMAS Christmas Day is honored here by a strict observance by all classes and denominations. Nearly all the churches were open for service both morning and evening. Charity to the poor was dispensed with a liberal hand; family gatherings and quiet and sober enjoyment marked the festive season, and were in accord with the spirit of the day. Reviewing the year now gone, we have reason for thankfulness that a fair share of prosperity has been awarded to us; there is no great amount of poverty, and our working classes are in comfortable circumstances. THE S3, rXAraXELUR. The steamship Austrian is behind time, and I add a few particulars regarding the steamship Plainmeller, whose captain was unhappily lost overboard before she reached this port. Captain Ford, who was only 28 years of age, was a resident of Bristol, England, and, by all who knew him, was highly esteemed for his manly qualities, his courage and generosity. He was a fine specimen of a true British sailor bold, skillful, cool and self-possessed in danger. In November last he was mate of the steamer Fernwood, on her voyage from Baltimore to Liverpool, when she fell in with the ship Forest Belle in a sinking condition. By great gallantry and daring he succeeded in rescuing the crew, ten in number, by means of his lifeboat, risking his life in the midst of a heavy gale and stormy sea on this mission of mercy. For this gallant deed he received the Royal Humane Society's medal just before leaving on the present voyage, which unfortunately proved to be his last. In a tremendous gale, on December 16th, a heavy sea struck the Plainmeller, which shifted the cargo and gave her a bad list to starboard, so that the rail was under water, and the vessel strained and labored heavily. On the following day Captain Ford had just taken his observation at noon, and was returning from the bridge to the chart room when a heavy sea struck the vessel and carried him overboard. Only two men were on deck at the wheel, and on the alarm being given the steward threw a life buoy to the captain who was struggling in the water. The buoy was only 30 yards from him, and being a splendid swimmer he made towards it, when the force of the wind, as it rose on the top of the sea, carried it right away from him. He then turned towards the ship, but almost immediately disappeared. The sea was running mountains high, and nothing could be done to save him. He was to have been married on his return to England to a young lady in Bristol. The chief officer, Mr. Matthews, and the chief engineer deserve great credit for bringing the steamer safe to this port, after battling with a succession of fearful gales, with a wrecked vessel and such a dangerous cargo as pig iron. The Plainmeller now lies at the wharf of the Hon. A. Shea, agent for the Allan Co., who has entire charge of the vessel, and is pressing on the repairs with all due speed. The want of a graving dock to effect such repairs as she requires is once more demonstrated, and it is to be hoped initiatory steps will soon be taken to secure such a desideratum. Since a week before Christmas the weather has been unusually cold and stormy, the thermometer, on one or two occasions, having been four degrees below zero, a very uncommon occurrence so early in the winter. On New Year's Day we had a heavy snowstorm. OUB LONDON LETTER. A Christmas to The Sheffield election Conservative demonstration in Le Tlehnorne claimant Loss of the Borsnsln The small birds, from our correspondent LONDON, January 24, 1879. Christmas day has brought the densest and most disagreeable fog that we have experienced in London for some years. In this suburb St John's Wood which is generally comparatively free from fog, it is impossible at mid-day to make out even the outline of any object on the opposite side of the road, and the condition of the central parts of the metropolis, where the fog usually contains a considerable admixture of smoke, must be much worse. Diners out will have some difficulty in reaching their destination, for all traffic, except on the underground railway, is necessarily suspended, and few undertakings are so dubious as to result as the attempt to find one's way, in a dense fog, to a particular house in an unfamiliar quarter. Consequently there will be many vacant chairs at Christmas dinner tables today. The result of the Sheffield elections has been a surprise for most of us, not because the Liberal candidate has won, but because the Conservative party made such a gallant fight for the vacant seat. To poll within five hundred votes of their opponents in such a hotbed of Radicalism as Sheffield is unquestionably a triumph for the Government; and there can no longer be any doubt that a very large number of electors in the large constituencies who formerly supported Mr. Gladstone, are now followers of Lord Beaconsfield. It should be remembered that this is the first opportunity we have had of testing the relative strength of parties in the great boroughs since the Manchester election three years ago; and opinions were very much divided as to the effect which subsequent events have produced upon the minds of the independent section of electors whose votes decide every close contest. The Conservatives were by no means confident of making even a creditable spar, although they assumed a bold front to the last. They had been disappointed by the refusal of their most promising candidate, Mr. Mark Addy, to contest the seat; they had to put up with a young man, Mr. Stuart Wortley, a nephew of the Earl of Wharncliffe, of no local influence, without experience or distinction except in connection with a noble family; and on the other side was arrayed an organization which ever since Sheffield received the franchise, has monopolized the representation of the borough, and signally defeated every attempt to dispute its supremacy. Mr. Waddy, moreover, was a strong candidate. If, as a temperance man, he alienated the sympathies of the publicans, on the other hand he secured the adherence of the Permissive Bill party, who muster strongly in Sheffield. His opinions were advanced enough by securing the support of the Radicals to prevent the division of strength which has often been so fatal in Radical constituencies. He was especially recommended to the deluded idiots who still believe in the innocence of the Claimant; and on the Saturday before the election, the Irish vote, strong, was pledged in his favor. Three Irish members of Parliament Sullivan, Finigan, and Justin McCarthy strongly urged their fellow-countrymen to support Mr. Waddy. They said that he had given satisfactory assurances, that he had promised seriously to consider Irish questions, and to vote for an alteration of the land laws; and their exhortations were supported by a telegram from Mr. Parnell, calling upon every Irishman to aid in defeating the Government upon their chosen ground. The effect of all this was to throw the Irish vote en bloc into the Liberal scale at the last moment, and there can be no doubt that it decided the result of the election. How many moderate Liberals were disgusted by this coquetting with the Home Rule party we have no means of ascertaining, but it is probable that the loss was far inferior to the gain. Mr. Waddy owes his seat, therefore, to the Irish element in this constituency, and it is probable that Mr. Parnell and his influences will be able, as they had boasted, to influence the elections in about a dozen of our largest constituencies in the same manner. At the last elections in 1874 the Conservatives deemed themselves so weak in Sheffield that they ran no candidate of their own and supported Mr. Roebuck in order to keep out Mr. Chamberlain, now the radical member for Birmingham. They succeeded. In 1868 they started a candidate who only polled about 5,000 votes against a gross total of 42,000 on the other side. At the next general elections they may or may not be successful. The battle will then be fought on the new register, which has added some 3,000 votes to the Liberal strength; but there is a delightful uncertainty about the ballot which falsifies the most careful calculation. It is needless to remark that the result of the election has cast a gloom over the councils of the opposition. If they can only just manage to win in Sheffield, what hope have they of carrying the constituencies in Lancashire and Yorkshire, where, if public opinion has changed in the same degree as at Sheffield, their prospects must be well-nigh hopeless, with or without the help of the Irishmen. The Conservative demonstration at Leeds organized to give Sir Stafford Northcote an opportunity of replying to Mr. Gladstone's criticisms upon his financial policy, was successful, not only in point of numbers, but political effect. The Chancellor of the Exchequer showed himself thoroughly capable of defending his measures, and met Mr. Gladstone very fairly upon the statistical argument. It is significant, however, that he claimed the right to set off against the deferred extraordinary expenditures, which last April were already nearly four millions, the reduction effected in the national debt by the extended creation of terminable annuities and the new sinking fund, from which it is inferred that the Government will meet their difficulties next year by boldly transferring that portion of the floating debt for which they are responsible to the funded debt, just as the special appropriation from the Indian Exchequer for the Famine Fund has been recklessly expended upon the Afghan war. This would certainly not be an unpopular measure, for the taxpayers quake at the prospect of having to meet a deficit in the ordinary budget and the payment of deferred liabilities together, would otherwise be the case; and they will be thankful for relief in whatever shape it comes. The Tichborne Association propose to put the Claimant in candidature for Nottingham at the general election. That interesting criminal has almost completed seven years of his term of penal servitude, and his friends are endeavoring to upset the sentence upon a writ of error, and thus obtain his release. The objection taken is purely technical. The power of the Judge to sentence him to penal servitude for seven years is not disputed, of course. The contention of the Claimant's friends is that that term exhausted the punitive power: but inasmuch as the Lord Chief Justice passed the sentence, it will probably prove to be duly supported by legal authority and precedents. We have very meager accounts of the loss of the Borussia, the Dominion Line steamer which foundered in the Atlantic but it is suspected that she was not seaworthy, and more than hinted that the crew left the passengers to their fate. The statements of the survivors are conflicting, one of them admitting at first that there was a panic on board the ill-fated vessel, and that the crew lowered the boats without orders; the others earnestly asseverating that nothing of the kind happened. There were no passengers in the boat that was picked up. Her crew consisted of three of the officers and half a dozen seamen, a fact which points not so much to a save as the deliberate abandonment of the passengers. A Board of Trade enquiry is to be immediately held upon the disaster. It has been remarked that our stock of small birds has greatly diminished since last year. The hard winter killed a good many of them, and the survivors were again thinned by the wet weather in the summer, which, moreover, prevented them from breeding. The woods and hedges are now comparatively deserted. Last winter, too, during the cold weather, numbers of small birds were driven to seek for food in the gardens of the London suburbs, where ordinarily speaking nothing but smoky sparrows are to be seen. This year, instead of a small flock of linnets, finches, robins, thrushes, starlings and other winter residents, there is scarcely even a house sparrow. Perhaps our feathered friends took timely notice of the approaching frost and migrated to summer climes; but it is generally thought that most of them are dead. ",A story report,

Mays 121 New Job Printing House We take much pleasure in announcing to our friends and the public that we have added to our Binder and Stationery business well and our PRINTING OFFICE, which will be under the special charge of Mr. Hugh Caverot Jr., who was admitted a partner in our firm, January 5th from 1st September. With new type, the latest improved presses and steam power, we are in a position to turn out first-class work with promptness and reasonable rates. The combination of Bindery, Stationery and Printing departments under one roof gives us unprecedented facilities for executing orders in all the branches to the satisfaction of our customers. STON, PHILLIPS & Co. Job Printers, 128 Notre Dame Street, Continued from second page some of them had paid a much higher price than they should have done for their wagons, etc. It is a great mistake for immigrants to take heavy articles with them; the carriage costs more than they are worth. We started for THE PRAIRIE DISTRICT, crossing the Assiniboine, which will rail lay for 40 miles along the banks of the Red River. For ten miles or so to the La Salle River the road passes through a rather low and wooded country, most of the timber being in small copses. We then emerge on open prairie, most of the river lots being settled and under cultivation. This continued, with intervals of unbroken prairie, all the way to Morris, which we reached at dusk. The prairie west of the road was mostly unbroken and had been swept by fire. We saw a good many stacks of prairie hay and some cattle. Prairie chickens were pretty numerous, and we shot 25 brace on this journey. The land at Morris is hardly so heavy as nearer Winnipeg. Winnipeg. Crops were reported to average 18 to 20 bushels per acre. Next day we struck west along the second base line, and ten miles out reached the Lowe farm, the only house for 25 miles. We were kindly entertained by Mr. Lowe, Jr., on our return. This farm consists of 19,000 acres, which Messrs. Lowe intend farming on a scale similar to the Dalrymple farms. They have erected a fine house and buildings and have 500 acres broken for next crop. They have had some losses among their horses, the work of breaking being severe, and the hay and water not suiting horses from Ontario at first. Oxen or mules do better for breaking. They have also had some difficulty in getting good water, and have put down a bore of 90 feet in the rock, where they hope to find a good supply. Meantime they have to draw supplies some distance. Water is one of the first considerations with the settler. It is rare that water is so difficult to get as in the case we have mentioned. The water of the creeks is good, and we made a point of tasting the well water at a good many places we visited. Sometimes it was sweet, and sometimes it had an alkaline or sulphurous taste, but stock take to it readily enough. The Lowe farm is all level prairie, with a little marsh, on which you might drive a plough for miles in any direction. It is intersected here and there by small channels or coulees, which carry off the water in spring, but do not impede a plough or reaper. The soil is a rich, black mould, eighteen inches deep on a clay subsoil. Our trail for several miles lay through the south corner of the big marsh, consisting of many thousand acres, which is flooded by the Boyne River in the rainy season, but could be drained with little difficulty. It was covered with most luxuriant grass, in some places three to four feet high. In some places it was still soft, and the horses went up to the knees and pulled us through with some difficulty. We travelled over 40 miles, and reached Messrs. Bidder's farm on Tobacco Creek just in time, as we were hardly well inside when a thunderstorm, with heavy rain, came on, and a very dark night. Next day we drove over Messrs. Bidder's farm and some of the surrounding country. Messrs. Bidder have several thousand acres of nice dry land, well situated on the creek, along which there is some fair timber. They have not yet cultivated much wheat, as they are some distance from a market, but they expect ere long to have communication with Winnipeg by the Pembina Railway branch, which will add greatly to the value of their land. Their wheat has averaged fully thirty bushels per acre. This and the Pembina mountain district is considered one of the finest parts of Manitoba. The Pembina mountains are terraces of some 200 to 300 feet high, well clad with timber, their summits being an immense plateau of level prairie, which is thickly settled nearly as far west as Rock Lake. This district is fairly well wooded and grows the wild dog rose, a sign of good dry land. We re-crossed the Atlantic with a young man who had bought 320 acres, with a log house and some improvements, for $800. We had fine weather for our return to Winnipeg, and witnessed a Red River dance at Morris. We also drove out to Mr. Gerrie's farm on Sturgeon Creek, eight miles northwest of Winnipeg. Mr. Gerrie owns 40,000 acres in different parts of the Province, and has here a block of 5,000 acres, nearly all dry and well situated. The soil is a black loam of 12 to 18 inches deep, on a friable clay loam. A crop of oats, sown on breaking, had been very bulky; but the quality of the oats grown on new land is generally poor. Mr. Gerrie has sold a part of this block at $1 an acre. Returning to Winnipeg we passed through a considerable breadth of lower land on which hay had been cut. We saw loads going into town, where it sells from $6 to $8 a ton in quantity. Six dollars is about the lowest price; and as the cost of cutting, stacking, and delivering in town does not exceed $3 to $3.50 per ton, it seems to be a profitable business on land which yields two tons per acre, and which can be bought at less than $5. We also drove out with Mayor Logan and some other gentlemen to Bird Hill, east of the Red River, from which we had a fine view. The country east of the river is more rolling and broken than the west side, and more wooded. We saw prairie fires to the south and west. The railway from Winnipeg to Selkirk is now finished, and we saw here some large deposits of gravel, which by-and-bye will be of great use in road making. We passed through the settlement of SILDOXA, which skirts both banks of the Red River north of Winnipeg. It was settled by Highlanders from Sutherlandshire in 1812. The claims are from 5 to 12 chains wide, and go four miles back. Only a small proportion along the river is cultivated, the rest being used for hay and pasture. We saw land which had been in wheat for 35 to 50 years, and took samples of the wheat, soil, and subsoil. We also saw some first-rate turnips. We did not see any signs of manure being applied, though we saw manure heaps, the accumulations of 50 years. As there is no decrease of crops the natives do not think it necessary to use manure yet; indeed it has been customary to draw the manure on to the ice of the river in winter and allow it to go off in the spring freshets. Others who had not this facility had found it necessary to remove their barns rather than remove the manure heap. The cultivated land was clean and seemed in good condition. On the banks of the river we could see a depth of 12 to 14 feet of soil, all alluvial deposit. The settlement of Selkirk, farther down the river, was settled in the same way, and is similar to Kildonan. Returning to Winnipeg we saw a start being made on the first section of the Canada Pacific Railway west of the point. The construction of this section is contracted for at $6,000 per mile, being little more than the cost of rails, sleepers, and ballasting. The cost of working will also be light, as the steepest gradient from Lake Superior to the Rocky Mountains does not exceed 1 in 100. When in Winnipeg a banquet was given to the Ministers Aikins and Bowell, to which the delegates were invited, and at which a great future for the Northwest was confidently predicted. Mr. Cowan, from Wigtownshire, who visited the district west of the Portage, as far as Rapid City, kindly favored us with his notes on that section. He says the land for 12 miles west of the Portage is good, similar to the land of High Bluff. Twenty miles west is low and rather marshy, then changes to a sandy loam, and then very low for 16 miles past Gladstone, and no use till drained. The trail here strikes White Mud River, a clear, and in places rapid stream. From White Mud River to Stoney Creek and over Riding Mountains, the land is light and sandy in parts, but generally good rolling prairie, fit for mixed husbandry, till the Prairie City on the Little Saskatchewan is reached. From Prairie City to Rapid City the trail is along this river, the banks of which are light and gravelly, but a mile back the land is good rolling prairie, not quite so heavy as the land near the Portage. The south trail from Rapid City to the Portage passes through land similar to that we have described. In this big plain, 23 miles east, Mr. McKenzie has a farm of 4,000 acres. This gentleman, who came from Ontario eleven years ago, gave Mr. Cowan some useful information. He owns about 18,000 acres of land, selected very judiciously in various parts of the province. One of his sons is on a farm of 1,700 acres on the Beautiful Plain, and has 300 acres under crop. He has also a grazing farm, 60 miles northwest of the Portage, on which he says 800 acres would yield enough hay to winter 2,500 cattle. He lives on a farm of 2,400 acres, 9 miles west of Portage-la-Prairie, some of which he has cultivated for nine consecutive years. His wheat yielded 41 bushels per acre in 1877, 36 bushels last year, and he expects 40 bushels from this year's crop, all of the fine variety, and 60 to 62 lbs per bushel. He sows wheat from 15th April to 12th May, and reaps in August. Oats may be sown till 20th May, and barley as late as 10th June. Oats yield 75 to 80 bushels per acre, 34 to 36 lbs; barley, 40 to 45 bushels, 50 to 53 lbs. He drills in about 1 bushel of each. His land is a good black loam, 18 inches deep, on a subsoil of 3 or 4 feet of loamy clay, and grows excellent crops of roots of all kinds. Potatoes, with very rude cultivation, grow 7 to 10 tons per acre, and turnips as high as 30 tons without manure; swedes frequently weigh 16 to 20 lbs. One exhibited last year weighed 36 lbs. Good water is found at 16 feet, and stock do well. Mackenzie has a stock of very useful well-bred cattle, the best in the Province. He finds a ready market for all his produce in settlers coming in, and expects to need no other for some years. He pays $40 a year and board for white labor; and $2 per day and board for Indian labor. He had an Indian ploughing one of his fields. Mackenzie must be considered a good authority on the matter of crops, but his results are relatively considerably better than the average, and it would not be safe to calculate on his figures. Though we spent nearly four weeks on our journey to and from Manitoba, including the time we were there, we only saw a very small proportion of the 1,000,000 acres it contains; and as Manitoba is only the beginning of the immense extent of fertile country which extends to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, we can hardly do more than say that we have had our foot in the Northwest. The British possessions in North America are larger than the whole of Europe, and larger than the United States, without Alaska; and as the wheat region through which the Canada Pacific Railway will pass is estimated to contain 160 million acres, the Canadians may well be enthusiastic over their possessions. None of the delegates went west of Rapid City, but the country south to the Assiniboine is reported good dry land, water good, and timber scarce. At Shoal Lake, 40 miles away, the land is similar, and on to Fort Ellice and the Touchwood Hills. At Edmonton, 850 miles, the land is said to be undulating and of the highest cultivation, and those who have visited the Peace River describe it as the finest country of the whole, and say that notwithstanding its high latitude it grows richly, while owing to its situation on the east slope of the Rocky Mountains, the climate is much milder than in the much lower latitudes. A diagram to a man, on which isothermal lines of winter and summer are marked, will illustrate this. But I may say that while it is in the same latitude as Scotland, the summer is similar to that of Belgium. Most of the land in Manitoba is now taken up, and emigration is moving westward to the free grant lands. The land is surveyed in sections of a mile square, or 640 acres; half of these sections, corresponding to the white squares of a draught board, are reserved as railway lands, and sold at fixed prices according to distance from the line of railway. The sections corresponding to the black squares are reserved as free grant lands, each settler receiving 160 acres on payment of a nominal sum, and with power to buy 160 acres more on easy terms, the price varying from $1 to $2.50 per acre. The policy of the Government is, if possible, to build the railway ahead of settlement, but we hardly think it will succeed. The Government also wish to prevent speculators getting possession of large breadths of land to hold on speculation, but in this they have hitherto failed, as many men own from 10 to 40 thousand acres within 100 miles of Winnipeg. These lands at present bring in no revenue to the owners; indeed it is probable that some are paying interest on the purchase money at high rates. These lands are all for sale at prices from $1 to $5 per acre for unbroken land, and in some cases improved lots might be bought for much higher sums. There are many men who have taken up homesteads and preemptions who will sell their rights for a small profit, so there is no likelihood of land being scarce for many years to come, and settlers who can pay the prices I have named do not need to go far west unless they choose. On the whole, I was favorably impressed with Manitoba, and the other delegates whom I met expressed the same opinion. No one who sees the immense extent of fertile soil and the excellence of its products can doubt for a moment that there is a great future before that country. Nearly everyone we met who had seen anything of the Northwest spoke of it in glowing terms; and though it is necessary to allow considerable discounts of the statements of those who have not much experience in agriculture, we were satisfied that settlers with industry, experience, and some capital could not fail to do well. A man with $100 can make a start on a homestead; a man with $200 to $300 can start well; but as a rule men with more capital have the best chance. Stock do well, but require shelter and hay in winter. There is a good home trade in cattle, large numbers being imported at present from Minnesota. The cattle we saw in Manitoba were good and strong, rather short of breeding, but infinitely superior to the Texas and native Colorado cattle we afterwards saw in Chicago market. We think Galloway cattle would suit the country well. Yearling cattle were selling at $12 to $16; two-year-olds at $20 to $25; and three-year-olds at $40 to $45. Draft oxen bring $90 to $180 per pair according to size, condition, and training. Most of the settlers at present are avoiding the low lands and taking up the dry lands for wheat-growing, which gives a quicker return than cattle; but as soon as stock-raising is more general, we think these lands will be found very valuable. We saw some few flocks of 50 to 100 sheep. In some districts a spear grass grows, which gets into the wool, pierces the skin, and kills the animal; but this only occurs at one part of the year, and when the land is cultivated this grass disappears. Like cattle, sheep require shelter and hay in winter. The disadvantages of Manitoba are at present bad roads, especially in the rainy season; the long winter of fully five months; the scarcity of wood and of water in some parts; the mosquitoes and black flies, which for a couple of months in summer, and especially in marshy places, are very annoying to man and beast, and particularly to new settlers. The opening of the railway will help to get over the first difficulty, and also bring in supplies of timber where needed. Care is required in selecting land where good water can be had. The winter is long, and the temperature often very low; but we were assured by Governor Morris and others that the cold is not severe, as the air is generally still and clear, and that even invalids with weak lungs find the climate healthy and pleasant. There is no cure for the insect plagues, which, however, disappear as the land is drained and cultivated. It is well for the emigrant to be prepared for these difficulties, which we would be careful neither to exaggerate nor conceal. As a field for money-making and enterprise, we consider the Northwest decidedly the best part of the Dominion; and those who are willing to face those difficulties and disadvantages of pioneer life, difficulties and disadvantages which will be rapidly overcome, and which are nothing to those which the early settlers in Ontario had to contend with, have every prospect of success and independence. It would be a great mistake to suppose that I recommend Manitoba to all who think of emigrating. The propriety of going there depends very much on the means and habits of the emigrant. There are many whom I could not recommend to make a change which would involve the loss of a good many of their present life comforts, and which might be especially hard on the female members of the family; but young people with health, energy, and some means, accustomed to work, would certainly improve their condition and do well. There are many families, too, who may be working as hard here, without making things any better, as they would have to do there, for whom the change would be a good one. We left Winnipeg on Tuesday, 21st October, and, travelling night and day, reached Chicago in 48 hours. We passed over the St. Paul and Michigan Central Railways, a distance of 1,200 miles, on free passes. These railways carry most of the emigrants who go to the Northwest at present, and the arrangements are very satisfactory. During the whole of the first day we traversed the expanse of burned prairie we have already described, which often stretched away for miles to the horizon unbroken by a house or tree, but strewn with numerous bones of buffalo, deer and other animals, scattered over the surface, or half buried in the soil. Near Emerson and Cookton we saw some farms of considerable size; on one there were excellent buildings, and five or six teams were returning from work. On another we saw ten horses at work driving a thrashing machine; there were more than 100 large stacks of wheat in the fields and at the buildings, and it struck us that there was work enough for a steam thrasher, and that the horses would have been better employed ploughing. At night we passed some extensive prairie fires, which were tearing along before a brisk wind, and where the grass was high, leaping to a great height. It was a grand sight. We heard that many settlers had lost house and crop by recent fire. We spent two weeks in Ontario, which was not sufficient to see it thoroughly, but our visit was cut short by an early fall of snow. We visited some farms near Toronto, on one of which we saw stumps extracted by an ingenious machine. Two men and a boy and a pair of light horses were pulling up large pine stumps expeditiously. These stumps are not ripe for pulling for seven or eight years after the trees are cut; and in passing through the Province the patches of land under stumps and the snake rail fences were the strangest features. We visited Guelph, and were kindly entertained by Messrs. McCrae, natives of that place, and several other gentlemen. This is one of the best-farmed districts of Canada, the stock of cattle on several farms being exceptionally good. The chief attraction here was the Ontario School of Agriculture and Model Farm, an excellent institution, partly supported by Government. They have at present 88 pupils, and have had to refuse many applications for want of accommodation. The pupils study and work half time. They are paid for their labor according to industry and ability, and it is possible for an active lad to make the payments for work nearly cover the charges of the school. We were shown over the farm by the Professor of Agriculture, Mr. Brown, a Scotchman. We saw a fine field of turnips tested to average 20 tons per imperial acre. 10 or 12 sorts of swedes had been tried. Experiments were also being made with different varieties of wheat. The pastures were sown out with clover and timothy, and were fairly good, but rather patchy in places. The land is a good, deep, gravelly loam, heavier than similar land here, and not so red in color; some parts were rather soft and heavy, but clean and in good order. The stock included good specimens of Shorthorns, Hereford, Devon, Polled Angus, Galloway, and Ayrshire cattle; and of Southdown, Lothwold, and Leicester sheep, a good many of the animals having been imported from this country. Several of the horses were very nearly pure Clydesdale. They are at present carrying on experiments in cattle feeding with animals of different breeds, and test the increase of live weight on the scales from time to time. Professor Brown expects each animal to gain 2 lbs per head daily. He has found it profitable to reduce the allowance of roots to 30 and 40 lbs daily, and allow a larger quantity of grain, say 6 to 10 lbs, according to circumstances. He has tried steaming and chopping all the food, but found the stock do equally well on the raw food. In experimenting with various forms and kinds of food he found that pigs made most progress on peas supplied whole, although a considerable proportion seemed to pass through the animals undigested. The results of these experiments, as well as a general report of the affairs of the school and farm are published annually, and form an interesting and instructive volume. We saw parties of students engaged on various farm work, attending stock, and thrashing out experimental lots of grain. We think this is a valuable institution and worthy of imitation in this country. We visited several farms in this district. At Mr. Stones' we saw some very good shorthorn stock and Cotswold sheep. At Mr. McCrae's, we saw good turnips and a nice herd of Galloways, including some of the principal prize winners at Ottawa. At Mr. Hobson's farm we saw some excellent shorthorns. Mr. Hobson feeds a good many cattle, buying half fat cattle in December and January, and feeding till June. He allows 12 to 15 lbs meal daily and 60 lbs roots. He also feeds off 400 lambs on rape, selling them in August at 10s to 12s each, and making them worth 22s to 24s by middle of December. The rape is sown in drills and worked the same as turnips. On this farm of 300 acres, 240 cleared, four men are employed in summer and two in winter, and some extra help at busy seasons. Mr. Hobson estimates the necessary capital for such a farm at $3 per acre. Of course where pedigree stock is kept it is much higher. We visited a farm of 180 acres, all good land except 20 acres, which was for sale at about $13 per acre. It was a nice place, near a railway station. The house was new, had cost $800; and the buildings were fair. Another farm of 200 acres, let at 12s an acre, was considered too dear. The soil was a fair sandy loam on a clay subsoil, intersected by a gravelly ridge. The turnips were a very good crop. The divisions of crop on this farm were as follows: 70 acres hay, 60 acres pasture, 15 turnips, 20 fall wheat, 20 peas, 20 oats. The taxes payable by the tenant were about $13, in addition to eight days' statute road labor. This farm was part of a block of 800 acres for sale at $12 per acre. Near Guelph we saw two farms of 400 acres farmed by two sons of the late Mr. Gerrand, Marchfield. They pay about $200 a year rent and taxes, and are said to be doing well. These seemed very desirable, in a good situation, and were for sale, price $12 to $13 per acre. We passed through part of the Paisley block, a district settled a good many years ago by emigrants from Paisley, few of whom had been brought up to farming. They have, in nearly all cases, been successful, and possess very comfortable residences and tidy, well-managed farms. We next visited Gait, where a large proportion of the people are of Scotch descent. Mr. Cowan, a native of Dumfrieshire, has a good farm of 540 acres in the neighborhood. Mr. Cowan is a member of Parliament, and well known as a breeder of Leicester sheep. We saw a first-rate flock of ewes. He also breeds shorthorns. The land is mostly rolling, a deep sandy loam, and free from stones. We went to Bow Park, near Brantford, where we met an old acquaintance, Mr. John Clay, Jr., of Kerchesters. Bow Park belongs to Mr. George Brown, of Toronto, a gentleman of much spirit and enterprise, who founded the splendid herd of shorthorn cattle there. Mr. Clay had just returned from Chicago, where they had sold 40 head of shorthorns at an average of 60 guineas each, and some Clydesdale horses at handsome prices. After luncheon we inspected the splendid buildings and the stock they contained. There are at present about 340 head of shorthorns and one or two Clydesdale horses on the farm. We first saw a very fine lot of one and two-year-old heifers, including some very stylish animals. We then passed through the stable for 24 horses, the immense barn filled with crop and hay, and root-house underneath. In a shed containing 44 loose boxes we found a splendid collection of cows and heifers of the Oxford, Princess, Duchess, and other famous tribes. Many of the animals were very fine, and had been imported from England at a great expense. Some had just returned from a round of shows, where they had carried all before them. In other sheds we found more cows and heifers and the bull 'Fourth Duke of Clarence', a magnificent bull of great style and substance. Mr. Clay informed us that they found a ready market for their young stock chiefly in the States. Now that Canadian cattle are shut out, they will have to find a market in Canada; but judging from the impetus which has been given to cattle-breeding by the export trade to England, we would expect the home trade to increase and by-and-by pay the proprietors. The importation and breeding of such a class of cattle is calculated to be of untold benefit to the province, and indeed to the whole Dominion. Bow Park estate contains 800 acres of fine sandy land situated in a loop of the Grand River, and grows excellent crops of Indian corn, rye, barley, and oats. A large breadth is cut for hay, and the 150 acres of Indian corn are also cut green and stand in stook till required for stock. The stock consume all the produce of the farm. We drove from Brantford to Paris through a very nice country. On the way we visited a very nice farm of 540 acres, 80 acres in wood, nicely situated and well laid out. The house was fine but buildings inferior. The land was a deep sandy loam, easily cultivated, but not in good order. We saw a 60-acre field of grass sown down five or six years ago, which was the best sward of grass we saw in Canada. This was a most desirable farm, and was for sale. We next went from PARIS TO WOODSTOCK, in Oxford Co., and visited Mr. Donaldson's farm of 300 acres at Zorra. Mr. Donaldson is a native of Cumberland, and had excellent farm buildings and very good turnips. He feeds a good many cattle and gave us some details of expenses and returns. He allowed 60 to 70 lbs turnips, and 8 to 10 lbs meal and bran daily, which he estimated rather low; we thought at 3s a week. His cattle paid 13s per month for grazing without cake, and from 22s to 30s per month for house feeding. He estimates grazing sheep at 3d per week, and wintering at 6d, or 20s 6d per annum. Ewes kept in this way should pay nearly 30s each in wool and lambs. He estimates the cost of fattening sheep in winter at 3d per week, including an allowance of grain. Sheep, like cattle, require to be housed in winter, and do well, if not too crowded; 40 in a lot being sufficient. Sheep in Canada are not affected by scab, foot-rot, or murrain. We stayed a night with Mr. Dunlop, a native of Ayrshire. Mr. Dunlop has his farms let at about 12s per acre. He also owns lands in Dakota, and furnished us with useful information. He estimates the necessary working capital for a farm of 200 acres in Oxford County, where 15 to 20 percent of the land is still under timber, at $40 to $60 per acre, but of course many start with much less. The annual labour bill would amount to 16s to 20s per acre if hired, but on such farms the farmer generally takes an active part in the work. He estimates the cost of raising fall wheat, including rent and taxes, at $75 per acre, and of spring wheat at $50. Barley sometimes pays as well as wheat, but prices are more fluctuating. Oats are only grown for home consumption. We visited a large cheese factory at Strathallan station, recently erected on the best principles. The storing room is placed some 20 feet from the making room, and is connected with it by a tramway. The piggeries are about 80 yards off. The balance of cheese on hand had been sold at 6陆d per lb. At Stratford we met Mr. Ballantyne and visited his factory at Black Creek, 8 miles off. This factory was started in 1864, and was one of the first in the neighborhood. Mr. Ballantyne is largely engaged in the cheese trade, is connected with a good many factories, and is probably as good an authority on cheese making and the cheese trade as we could have met with. He has devoted great attention to the scientific principles of cheese making and overcome the main difficulties which American makers have to contend with. He is of the opinion that in many cases the milk is tainted before it is drawn from the cow, owing to water pasture or other subtle causes which affect an article so susceptible of taint as milk. In dealing with such milk (which is indicated by floating gaseous curd), Mr. Ballantyne sets it at a temperature of 80 degrees; he maintains this temperature and draws off the whey as soon as possible, even at the loss of a little curd, as he holds that he gets rid of much of the taint in the whey and that allowing the whey to remain on the curd simply fixes and increases the taint. He allows the curd to ripen well before going to press during a period of from 1 to 5 hours, which the oxygen of the air brings the curd into proper condition. The fitness of the curd for press is tested on a moderately hot iron. If it is sufficiently ripe it should adhere to the iron and draw out in a stringy fashion. I do not know enough of cheese making to make any remarks of my own on these points, but no doubt many of you can appreciate these hints, which I simply repeat as Mr. Ballantyne stated them. July and August, when the weather is hot, is the most critical season with Canadian cheese makers, and we saw some August cheese made on a principle from tainted milk, which were perfectly sweet. At this factory they receive the milk of 1,000 cows, and make fully a ton of cheese daily. The cows yield most milk in June, some 26,000 lbs daily producing 2,600 to 2,700 lbs cheese. The worst yield is in July. The milk is richest in October, when 8陆 lbs milk will yield 1 lb of cheese. Farmers sending milk to the factories do not as a rule feed their cows highly, and consider $6 per cow a fair return for the season. Mr. Ballantyne said it would not pay them to make good cheese under 6d per lb, and that in consequence of the low prices prevailing for some time, many had fed off their cows. The make of American cheese was therefore short, and would probably continue so for some time. He expected to see prices maintained, and did not think makers of the English cheese would be affected as they had been by American competition for a good few years to come. We visited Niagara, and were much
