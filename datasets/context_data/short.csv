The fire thus far is confined to the Doughty tract, which covers over 30,000 acres. A thunderstorm is looming and it is thought that if it strikes here with any force it will put out the fire.

As Poupart explained how the software for this lightning-tracking system was developed in Florida and purchased four years ago by Hydro, how the lightning strikes are detected by half a dozen antennae erected across the province that triangulate a lightning strike to within 200 metres of the point of impact, the counter on the screen behind him showed more than 1,000 strokes recorded over a 22-hour period. ""They haven't figured out how to make lightning-proof equipment at Hydro, but newer, sturdier, better insulated equipment has reduced the damage toll.

Caille would not say what Rochon recommended to the cabinet, or whether he would recommend changes to the plans, which were drawn up by the province's 16 regional health boards and approved by a provincial advisory committee. The plans became controversial when some Parti Quebecois members complained they would require the hiring of too many bilingual employees at French health-care institutions, and that would conflict with the right to work in French. Rochon then agreed to allow the Office de la Langue Francaise to review the plans, sparking an angry reaction from some anglophone groups, who said they feared the government would try to reduce access to English-language services. The Office told Rochon in March they did not have enough information on how the plans would be put into action to give an opinion.

When lightning strikes, they're ready to repair damage total, blamed on thunderstorms. Levasseur said the amount of time it takes for power to be restored to an area depends on the circumstances of the blackout. Levasseur acknowledged that however sophisticated the utility's damage-control policies become for dealing with lightning, so far there's been no breakthrough in the war against freezing rain, which left some North Shore Hydro customers without electricity for days last winter. He said the utility is working on a system that could monitor the weight of freezing rain forming on power lines, but the technology was not yet in use across the power distribution network.

And even then, the only way Hydro can know if something as earthbound as windblown branches has knocked out power lines serving only a small percentage of their clientele, is when the affected customer picks up the phone and calls the problem in. In an effort to reduce the time customers spend waiting for repairs to be carried out, Hydro has publicized its 24-hour, toll-free number for reporting power outages - it's (800) 790-2424. It also provided several tips on what to do if your electricity is interrupted. They are: Turn off and unplug appliances, particularly sensitive equipment like computers or microwave ovens.

STELLA TZINTZIS The Gazette An ammonia leak that killed a 33-year-old worker and injured 22 others at an east-end veal-packing company in March 1997 was the result of carelessness by their employer, coroner Paul Dionne said in a report issued yesterday.

Xianda,218,"Montpak Ltd, the scene of the fatal accident, was filled with booby traps and safety hazards, Dionne wrote in his report. He said many of the company's 80 employees didn't know where emergency exits were located, oxygen masks were scarce and there was no alarm to sound in case of trouble. POORLY INSULATED PIPE The report also points out that the cooling system's main pipe could not be turned off to stop the leaking ammonia. When inhaled, the colorless gas burns holes through the lungs, which then swell and clog breathing. That's exactly what happened to Herculano Froias on March 21 last year. A poorly insulated pipe filled with liquid ammonia burst in the basement when someone dropped a heavy box on it. Froias, a Portuguese immigrant, was trapped in the basement electrical room with steel bars on the window. Several workers outside heard him screaming and ran across the street for help. They unsuccessfully tried tearing out the bars with metal chains attached to a nearby vehicle. Firefighters finally freed Froias more than 30 minutes later. He died of asphyxiation soon after arriving at the hospital. ""Mr.",0,19980522,modern,None,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Froias's death, the coroner added, was completely avoidable. Two people have died on the job in Quebec from ammonia inhalation within the last 10 years, and another 60 were compensated for injuries. Because it's cheap and less toxic than freon, ammonia is used in 270 cooling systems all over the province.

You'd barely entered the store when she greeted you with a cheery ""bonjour"" and asked if there was anything she could help you find. Now that you're in the changing room, she keeps stopping by to ask how you're doing, bringing along extra items which she thinks would go perfectly with the clothes you'd already tried on. You normally shop alone but find the extra pair of eyes useful.",0,19980522,modern,None,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Xianda,218,"You normally shop alone but find the extra pair of eyes useful. If it was up to you, you'd have ruled out that skirt, sure it made you look too hippy. But she insisted it looked great, and why would she lie? Perhaps because she isn't really your friend, just a not very well-paid employee anxious to keep her job, which hinges on selling a specific amount of merchandise per week, on good days and bad, whether it makes the customer look like Princess Diana or a beluga. And because she has no way of knowing that you aren't a spy, one of those mystery shoppers bosses hire to make sure staff are friendly, courteous and pull out all the stops to make a sale. ""Retail sales is a scam these days,"" said a veteran Montreal saleswoman disgusted with the hard-sell techniques which Canadian retail chains have imported from the States over the last couple of years. ""It's like being a telemarketer. You just keep pushing the customer until you hook her in.""",0,19980522,modern,None,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Xianda,218,"""It's like being a telemarketer. You just keep pushing the customer until you hook her in."" MORE AGGRESSIVE SALES PITCH The woman, who was so nervous about speaking out that she refused to give her name or the company she worked for, said salespeople aren't pushy because they're earning a commission - in fact, most of them are part-time employees who earn little more than minimum wage. But she said that with fierce competition for retail sales, many local stores, especially national chains, have adopted a much more aggressive sales pitch. Sales staff are trained to greet a customer within 30 seconds after she or he enters the store. If the customer insists she's 'just looking,' the clerk will give her a two-minute reprieve before moving in again - before someone else beats her to it. A chart posted at the back of the store monitors which employees are meeting weekly sales targets. ""It doesn't matter if there's no traffic or no electricity, there are no excuses,"" she said. ""If you don't meet your quota, they put a big red mark beside your name. If you exceed it, they might mark it in yellow. Some places put a star beside your name.",0,19980522,modern,None,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Xianda,218,"""If you don't meet your quota, they put a big red mark beside your name. If you exceed it, they might mark it in yellow. Some places put a star beside your name. It's so childish, like we're in kindergarten."" It's certainly a big change from the old days, when service, Canadian-style, was a bit of a joke. Years ago, a colleague who had lived in Chicago and Miami once mentioned the rude awakening he got the first time he wandered into a downtown department store 20 minutes before closing time - only to be hustled to the door by bored workers who'd already closed their registers. In a national survey conducted over the Christmas holidays, twice as many Quebecers as other Canadians complained about the service in retail outlets, citing salespeople who were rude, too friendly or overly aggressive. SPOT THE SPY However, as the Canadian pendulum swings toward the Wal-Mart formula, workers have a new worry - corporate snitches hired to guarantee service with a smile. Still, an experienced salesperson can often spot a spy. ""They keep looking at their watches, to see how long it takes you to come over.",0,19980522,modern,None,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Xianda,218,"Still, an experienced salesperson can often spot a spy. ""They keep looking at their watches, to see how long it takes you to come over. Or they'll ask really stupid questions or insist on trying on 25 items."" Given the flap over McDonald's workers fighting for better working conditions, the disgruntled saleswoman suggests it's time to give a thought to non-unionized retail personnel. Often middle-aged women who don't have other marketable skills, they can't afford to complain when the store manager raises their sales quota, cuts their hours or gives better shifts to young, inexperienced students who only plan to stay a couple of years and are prepared to do what they're told. As for herself, although she works for a mid-sized clothing chain, she shops in department stores. ""There's no service, but at least nobody bothers you.""

The June issue of Golf Digest reports that more than 200 Americans are killed by lightning every year and it's estimated that five times that many people are struck. Of the total number killed, half are golfers. Statistics Canada says that 13 Canadians were killed by lightning over a three-year period from 1986 to 1988. It's not known how many of those deaths occurred on golf courses or how many people actually reported being struck. Still, the only thing worse than playing golf in a thunderstorm is flying a kite in it with a steel line. It's an open invitation for catastrophe.

Xianda,220,"PGA Tour veteran Lee Trevino, along with Jerry Heard and Bobby Nichols, were involved in the most publicized lightning incident in golf history during the 1975 Western Open at the Butler National course in Oak Brook, Ill. A week before that incident, Tom Watson caused a controversy when he walked off the course at nearby Medinah during the 1975 United States Open because of a threat of lightning which officials had deemed was not immediately apparent. As a result of such incidents, the United States Golf Association adopted Rule 6-8a (ii) in its Rules of Golf which allows any player to discontinue play if he feels lightning threatens. Montreal-area golf courses are far from a safe harbor from the storm when it comes to lightning. Montreal averages 25 electrical storms a year, but 20 of those are recorded during the most active golf months of June, July and August. ""We've already had five, including Monday's of this week,"" said Steve McCuskey, weather information specialist at Dorval. ""We've entered the busiest time of the year for lightning."" Lightning is commonly described by laypeople as either ""chain"" or ""sheet,"" but both types present a risk.",0,19900622,modern,thunder,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Xianda,220,"""We've entered the busiest time of the year for lightning."" Lightning is commonly described by laypeople as either ""chain"" or ""sheet,"" but both types present a risk. McCuskey explained the chain variety as the oftentimes spectacular jagged bolts from the sky towards the ground and sheet as the flash of lightning going from cloud to cloud. ""Chain is the more dangerous,"" said McCuskey, ""but sheet lightning can come towards the ground at any time."" It's also incorrect, for the most part, to say someone has been ""struck"" by lightning if they've lived to tell about it. A miracle aside, no one can survive a direct hit of the millions of volts of electricity in a bolt of lightning. What actually occurs is that they've suffered the effects of the bounce of the energy charge when it has struck something nearby. ""They may have received enough of the electrical current to experience a shock, but they certainly were not the main conductor,"" said Professor Geoff Austin of McGill University's radar observatory in Ste. Anne de Bellevue. ""If you are hit by lightning directly, you've run out of luck,"" said Austin.",0,19900622,modern,thunder,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Xianda,220,"Anne de Bellevue. ""If you are hit by lightning directly, you've run out of luck,"" said Austin. McCuskey said golf courses are prime targets for lightning because of the terrain, trees and water and because a golfer is usually the highest point. ""Lightning seeks out the highest point,"" he said. Major golf associations like the USGA have taken precautions against lightning by purchasing a lightning sensor capable of detecting the menace up to 200 miles away. The Quebec Professional Golfers' Association recently bought a similar device for use during its tournaments. Some public and private clubs, such as Beaconsfield in Pointe Claire, have ways of warning its golfers that lightning is near.

West Germany's parliament was set to follow suit, after a debate in which Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Germans in both states should seize the historic opportunity to unite, accepting the permanent loss of territory to Poland as part of the price. ""Germans in West Germany and East Germany are now once again inseparably bound together,"" Kohl declared. He appealed to West Germans to accept economic sacrifices to help East Germany's disintegrating economy. Formal recognition of the Oder-Neisse border, renouncing claims to land which Germany lost to Poland after World War II, was a key condition for international acceptance of German unification after 45 years of division.

CRK In quiet Bievoiuiosi born 30 years ago today Lesage changed course of history CLAUDE ARPIN THE GAZETTE It was 30 years ago today that the late Jean Lesage ushered in Quebec's Quiet Revolution. But if he'd had his way, he would have been a simple actuary, according to his son, Jules. ""Politics wasn't his first love,"" the 50-year-old lawyer said this week.

Xianda,220,"""Dad enjoyed counting so much he would have been quite happy doing it for a living."" Instead, the Quebec City youth was talked into a legal career. Too poor to send him to Montreal to study accounting, his parents enrolled him in the faculty of law at Universit茅 Laval. That decision was to change the course of Quebec's history. When Lesage's 脡quipe de l'Action (Thunder Team) of Liberals won power on June 22, 1960, it spelled the end of a stifling 16-year reign by Premier Maurice Duplessis, whose tenure was referred to as La Grande Noirceur (the Great Darkness). Reminiscing over the momentous June 22 vote, Jules Lesage recalled that much of the Quiet Revolution was fashioned in his father's house on Bougainville St. in Quebec City. ""I'd say the big decisions were hammered out on our dining-room table,"" he said. ""That's where his father and a handful of cabinet ministers and advisers hatched their most daring plot to seize Quebec's education system from the clergy.

First of a two-part series JONATHON GATEHOUSE The Gazette LA BAIE - As the heavens open up, people run for the cover of front porches and cars. The rivulets trickling in the channels between rounded boulders quickly expand into cataracts of roaring white foam. In the gathering darkness, roofs and trees begin to float by on the wall of water and the dull thump of helicopters fills the air. The 2,300 people crammed into the stuffy community centre on a hot July night squirm in their seats and murmur, unsure how to react to the dramatic depiction of the most devastating flood in Quebec history, as thousands of gallons of water flow across the enormous stage in front of them. But when the grand historical pageant they're watching comes to its singing-and-dancing finale a few minutes later, they leap to their feet and deliver a sustained round of applause. The $100,000 the city of La Baie spent on rain-making machines to add last summer's deluge to its main tourist attraction, La Fabuleuse Histoire d'un Royaume, didn't go to waste. It's only one short year since a huge storm dumped 277 millimetres of rain on the Saguenay region in three days, unleashing torrents of water that caused more than $700 million in damage, but the events of July 19-21, 1996, have already become part of the local mythology. Now, as life in the flood-ravaged communities slowly returns to normal, the region has been hit by two far more welcome waves - an economic boom and an inundation of tourists. ""We've had a lot of tourists since the floods, and that's great,"" says Cyprien Gaudreault, La Baie's deputy mayor. ""We want to prove to people that the residents of the Saguenay have recovered and are strong."" Last summer's flooding killed 10 people, drove more than 15,800 across the region from their homes, and destroyed or severely damaged the homes of 3,500 families. The ""once-in-1,000-years"" storm unleashed the full fury of nature on the area bordering the Saguenay River Fjord, which is 175 kilometres northeast of Quebec City. Two reservoirs serving communities in the region overflowed or gave way during the sustained downpour, releasing as much as four times the normal water flow into rivers and streams. Entire villages were left underwater as rivers ate through dikes or carved beds around dams that would not give way. Sections of the area's three major cities - La Baie, Chicoutimi and Jonquière - that had never been flooded in more than a century of settlement were wiped off the map in a matter of hours. Please see FLOOD, Page A3 Fatal floods in Europe, Page A4 QUOTE Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but rising every time we fall. Confucius DNA tests exonerate Milgaard Murder case reopened after man jailed for 23 years is cleared STEPHEN BINDMAN and JOHN IBBITSON Southam Newspapers TORONTO - The Saskatchewan government has apologized to David Milgaard after science proved what he and his family have been claiming for almost 30 years - that he spent most of his adult life in prison for a murder he didn't commit. Sophisticated DNA testing completed at a British laboratory yesterday confirmed Milgaard did not rape and kill Saskatoon nursing-aide Gail Miller in 1969 and appeared to point to the man he and his supporters have long said was the true killer. ""It has been 27 years for all of us, and we are glad it is over now,"" a subdued Milgaard said in Winnipeg. ""Waiting for today has been a struggle."" The startling developments in the 28-year-old murder case prompted Saskatoon police to reopen their investigation and led to a contrite apology from Saskatchewan's justice minister. ""It appears that a wrong of the most serious kind has been done to Mr. Milgaard by our justice system,"" John Nilson said. ""For this we owe him and his family the most heartfelt apology."" Nilson said he is ""actively considering"" an independent inquiry into all aspects of the case and discussions would begin immediately on compensation for Milgaard and his family. The federal justice minister, Anne McLellan, expressed her ""deepest sympathies and regret"" to Milgaard and his family. ""The (DNA) results show that a terrible wrong was done to David Milgaard by his wrongful conviction."" Milgaard was released from prison in 1992 after 23 years when the Supreme Court of Canada overturned his murder conviction following an unprecedented review, but the top court did not exonerate him. The Saskatchewan government said too much time had elapsed to retry him, but has since steadfastly refused to call a public inquiry or compensate him for the years he spent behind bars.

Page E1 ALLEN McINNIS, GAZETTE Target: language police Boy, 14, plans to deluge OLF with empty complaints letters CAROLYN ADOLPH The Gazette Message to the Office de la Langue Française: beware of 14-year-olds carrying pamphlets. Liosha Kenjeev, tired of hearing so much angry talk about the language watchdog's stepped-up enforcement campaigns in English-speaking areas, has decided to mount a campaign of his own. ""I was thinking - if I know everyone is upset with the OLF, and I do, it's hard to get people to speak up,"" he said yesterday. ""I'd have to make it quite easy."" Kenjeev's idea is this: as a protest against the sudden outpouring of enforcement activity that has recently hit anglo merchants and municipalities, people should flood the OLF with complaints letters - letters with nothing in them. ""It's a political statement,"" he said. ""I already wrote the OLF to explain what it meant."" Kenjeev gets an A for industry. First he borrowed enough cash from his parents to print 500 posters exhorting people to rain empty letters upon the Office. Then it hit him that people would hardly be able to remember the mailing address he had put on the posters. So he went to Alliance Quebec, which agreed to pay for 1,000 fliers. Kenjeev is delivering them himself, to mailboxes all over the west end. Alliance Quebec president Michael Hamelin said he was impressed and hopes Montrealers will participate. ""What you've got there is a dedicated, angry young person who clearly wants to make a point. We need to make a statement about this harassment."" But OLF spokesman Gerald Paquette was unimpressed by the empty-letter campaign. ""Empty letters go in the garbage - that's what happens. You're shooting the wrong dog,"" he added in English, saying the OLF is merely an administrative organization. Hamelin said Alliance Quebec receives four or five complaints every day from merchants angry about petty infraction letters from the Office. One such complaint came from Brenda Levy, who co-owns a restaurant in a north-end shopping mall. Last month, an OLF inspector nailed her for three signs with equal-sized French and English words and for a unilingual ""hot club roll"" sign. ""I didn't think you could translate that. I don't know of any translation,"" Levy said yesterday. So she called the Office bureaucrat who wrote the infraction letter. ""He said: 'You'll have to find out yourself.'"" Paquette confirmed that complaints officials do not have to help people with translations. Other OLF officials will help, but charge $5 per consultation unless the question is related to a complaint. The address of the Office de la Langue Française is: Post Office Box 316, Tour de la Place Victoria, Montreal H4Z 1G8. ""We need to make a statement about this harassment."" Alliance Quebec president Michael Hamelin accuses vandalism Fire chiefs find office doors glued shut LYNN MOORE The Gazette The dispute between the city of Montreal and its firefighters took another nasty turn yesterday over what the city contended was another wave of vandalism in a conflict tied to contract negotiations. According to city and fire-department officials, disgruntled firefighters vandalized the vehicles and seven offices used by the department's 35 chiefs of operations. ""They have escalated their tactics to a level that is totally unacceptable,"" said Saulie Zajdel, the executive-committee member responsible for the fire department, who claimed fire hoses were used to flood vehicle interiors and glue or caulking was used to seal office doors and locks. ""The city is in the process of moving its chiefs to other sites and yesterday fired off a legal letter to the firefighters' association, informing it that it will have to pay for damage and moving costs."" Gaston Fauvel, president of the Montreal Firefighters Association, acknowledged yesterday there was ""one isolated incident"" of mischief at one fire station in which caulking was used to seal doors. But he insisted the city was seeking to manufacture a ""public-relations campaign"" to smear firefighters. ""It is just a big balloon (of propaganda) that they are trying to blow up."" What has incensed the city and ""has made (Mayor Pierre) Bourque crazy"" is the firefighters' most recent publicity campaign, which features Bourque as a devil with the phrase ""gestion d'enfer"" (administration from hell) across his chest. While yesterday's contest between the two feuding parties played out, the provincial Essential Services Council continued its deliberations on whether to put a stop to the firefighters' pressure tactics. A decision is expected next week, a spokesman said yesterday. The city's contract with its 1,617 firefighters expired in December but negotiations are at a standstill. The hottest point of contention is the city's plan to cut $9.25 million from the fire department's budget and eliminate 124 firefighters in 36 stations over the next two years. Operating on the principle that seeing is believing, Zajdel and assistant fire chief Andre Brunelle took reporters to Station 9 in Montreal's north end, where a substance that appeared to be caulking had been used to seal two interior doors and an exterior door. The substance had also been applied to the locks and one lock had a piece of metal in it. Similar damage was done to the six other offices in stations that house operations chiefs and their vehicles were vandalized, Brunelle said. ""It differs from one (station) to another but this (damage) is representative,"" he said. Fauvel hotly disputed that statement, saying he had visited five of the seven stations and the only damage he had seen was at Station 9. ""At the four other stations there was absolutely nothing,"" he said. ""There was no vandalism, there was nothing broken. There was nothing."" Fauvel's claim was later disputed by Zajdel, who responded: ""Give me a break."" Fauvel said the metal-jammed lock at Station 9 was caused when the chief of operations broke his key in the lock. He ordered that the caulking be removed from Station 9 doors, calling the situation ""an isolated incident that is a symbolic gesture that indicates that we'd prefer that (the chief of operations) stays in his office and doesn't mix with station personnel."" Firefighters at the station - most of whom were wearing Bourque-as-devil T-shirts - said the doors were like that when they arrived for their shift. Firefighter Karen Degagne said she and her colleagues are not allowed to strike and have limited means to make their positions known to management. ""They want to cut everything (the number of firefighters and trucks) and we want to make sure the public has proper service and they aren't in danger, and we aren't in danger,"" she said. ""At the four other stations there was absolutely nothing. No vandalism."" Firefighters' association boss Gaston Fauvel Royal Montreal greens getting greener Call it the greening of the greens. The Royal Montreal Golf Club, site of the coming Canadian Open and home to the oldest golf club in North America, is in the process of doing something groundbreaking: making the fairways safe for small creatures without cleated shoes, motorized carts or expense accounts. We're talking about the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees. The elite club, which began in 1873 when Alexander Dennistown and his friends took turns putting against the stone wall surrounding Hotel Dieu hospital, has spent two years and considerable effort getting back to nature. Already considered one of the nicest courses in Quebec, the 800-acre property on Ile Bizard is on the verge of being certified by Audubon International as an Audubon Cooperative Nature Sanctuary, a program designed to help landowners ""preserve and enhance the environmental quality of their property for the good of people and wildlife."" ""The open space of a golf course is utilized not only by golfers, but is habitat for a variety of wildlife species,"" says Maria Briggs, senior staff ecologist for Audubon International. ""We are pleased with the efforts of Royal Montreal to become certified in wildlife and habitat management, integrated pest management, water conservation, water-quality management and environmental planning. We look forward to receiving the certification request for their final category: outreach and education."" Two weeks ago, the Hillsdale course in Mirabel became the first in Quebec to be certified by Audubon International. Golf courses have often been singled out for their heavy use of pesticides, which help keep the turf bright green and weed-free but can have a harmful impact on the habitat, and the people who use it. A study by researchers at the University of Iowa identified a potential link between pesticide use on golf courses and higher-than-normal instances of cancer among golf-course superintendents. In recent years, however, some golf-course managers have joined forces with environmental groups, particularly Audubon, to find less potent ways to keep weeds and insects under control. At Royal Montreal, that has meant leaving half the golf course's terrain au natural - woods, wildflower zones and grassy areas which are mowed only once a summer. Other prime habitat areas include dead trees, which provide food and shelter for insects and birds. Blake McMaster, course and property manager, has also promoted integrated pest management. Staff members monitor for pest problems daily and determine what measures, if any, are needed to control them. ""With diseases, a change in the weather will normally bring relief without the need to apply fungicides so we rely heavily on the weather,"" McMaster explained. When a pest problem must be treated, Royal Montreal does its best to spot-treat. ""This is especially true with insecticides, as they will kill all insects including the beneficial ones in the soil,"" McMaster said. ""Last year, we treated a total of 400 square metres out of the 3,237,600-square-metre property - or 0.01 percent."" The project has also meant keeping track of the wildlife that lives in and around the course - so far Royal Montreal has identified foxes, a great blue heron, wood ducks with their young, turtles and a variety of birds. To make sure those animals and others continue to feel welcome, the club has built 46 houses and boxes for bats, bluebirds, purple martins, wrens, flickers and wood ducks. A pond ecologist has been hired to test the course's five ponds for pesticide and nutrient pollution. Royal Montreal proudly cites studies by the United States Golf Association which herald the economic and ecological benefits of golf courses to a community, including research which suggests a turf area of 2,000 square feet produces enough oxygen for one person per year. By that calculation, Royal Montreal is producing enough oxygen for more than 8,700 people a year, which is good news for the birds, and for the birdies.

Forecasters predicted the storms would continue through the weekend. On what was proclaimed a day of national mourning for the dozens of flood victims, more heavy rain pelted this cultural centre's watery streets, already lined with sandbags piled up to the windowsills. In Poland, 48 people have been lost to the overflowing, fast-moving Odra River, which grew to monstrous proportions over the past 10 days. At least 38 deaths in the Czech Republic have been blamed on the deluge. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in both countries, and factories, roads, farmland and animal stocks appear to have suffered massive damage. Meanwhile, in adjacent Germany the Oder River spilled over its banks into the centre of Frankfurt an der Oder, 90 kilometres east of Berlin. A 160 km dike, waterlogged but reinforced overnight by sandbags, prevented more serious flooding. ""Nature has done us in. I've lost 6 kilos in five days because I've been working to protect my home,"" said Janusz Siennack, an engineer who stood, hands caked with mud and pants legs ripped and flapping in the wind, outside his two-storey Wroclaw house. The agricultural tally alone in Poland, where about one-third of all people make a living from the land, is daunting: About 900,000 chicks and ducks, 4,825 pigs and hogs, 1,353 cattle and 90 sheep were carried downstream, according to preliminary farm ministry estimates. Dead horses have been seen floating by farmhouses. In the Czech Republic, the country's largest steel mills - Nova Hut, Vitkovice and Trinecke Zelezarny - cut back on production because raw materials are unable to reach the plants and finished steel couldn't move out. Losses are soaring into multibillion-dollar estimates. Both countries' markets have slumped from fear of flood losses. The storms have sparked legislation and high-level borrowing to cover the emergency. In Poland, the government sought a $110-million credit line from the Polish National Bank and a $300-million World Bank loan. The disaster also has engendered political gamesmanship two months before parliamentary elections.

Xianda,222,"It takes 6 to 9 kilograms of corn or soy to produce one kilogram of edible pork. And the difference ends up mainly as a whole lot of waste. While past agricultural methods have used manure as a natural soil conditioner, the boom in chemical fertilizers has shifted that balance. Now excess manure is creating pollution problems. In some cases, the waste seeps into local waterways causing not only water pollution but encouraging the growth of algae. This depletes the water's oxygen and reduces or destroys its aquatic life. The problems don't end there. Around the world livestock contribute to deforestation, soil erosion and desertification. Like all environmental issues, EARTHWEEK: A DIARY OF THE PLANET the answers to this problem are not always simple or obvious. The Worldwatch report says the solution lies in different directions including taxing or regulating environmentally destructive farming practices and restructuring development strategies. But it also goes on to say, If livestock are to live in balance with the environment again, First World consumers will have to eat less meat, while Third World citizens will need to keep their meat consumption low. Many of the articles being written on the subject lately state or imply that if you really care about the planet you must become a vegetarian. Durning, a vegetarian himself, doesn't agree. It's not true that to be an environmentalist you have to be a vegetarian. That's like saying to be an environmentalist you must never ride in an automobile. But, he adds, there is a strong environmental argument for reducing meat consumption fairly dramatically in North America and Europe perhaps cutting it in half. The decision to eat meat or not is a very personal one. Nevertheless, there can be little doubt that eating lower on the food chain benefits not only ourselves but the planet. By Steve Newman The warm water ocean phenomenon known as El Nino appears to be producing widespread climatic disruptions that are responsible for unusually severe weather from California to the Caribbean. Three savage storms lashed California, unleashing destructive flooding north of Los Angeles. At least four people drowned and about 20 recreational vehicles were swept away when the Ventura River suddenly surged over its banks. About 160 km of beaches between the Mexican border and Ventura were closed because of a health hazard caused by runoff and sewage spills. El Nino also is being blamed for some of the worst flooding ever to strike Havana. Storms around the Cuban capital whipped up high tides and large waves that flooded many low-lying areas. Government meteorologists predict that cloud cover and rain caused by the phenomenon may stunt crop development across the island through early April. The driest January in 30 years has destroyed at least 75 per cent of South Africa's maize harvest and threatens food supplies across many neighboring countries. Zambia and Zimbabwe also are in the grips of a severe dry spell, but they may not be able to rely on South African farmers to make up for crop losses as in previous poor harvests. The worst drought to affect Ecuador in 30 years has caused a critical shortage of hydroelectric power and forced the government to purchase electricity from neighboring Colombia. The Paute generating plant, which supplies 85 per cent of the electrical power to the national grid, has recently been operating only two of its 10 turbines. It has sometimes been forced to halt operation completely due to the extremely low water level of the Paute River. For the week ending 14 February 1992 A1992 Chronicle Mideast Storms A winter-long string of storms continued to lash the eastern Mediterranean with a variety of destructive weather conditions. Torrential rains caused the Jordan River to flood for the first time in 40 years, and half of the crops in the Jordan Valley have been destroyed by the inundation as well as blizzards, freezing temperatures, and high winds. Transportation, communications and electrical power have been disrupted by the storms from Turkey to the Red Sea. The nearly continuous winter rainfall ended a severe drought across the region by filling reservoirs and replenishing groundwater supplies. A strong earthquake struck the remote Vanuatu Islands, but there were no reports of damage. Earth movements were felt in the Aleutian Islands, Kuril Islands, and Northern California. Tropical cyclone Cliff lashed French Polynesia with winds of 130 km/h and pounding high surf. Forty homes were destroyed on Pukapuka Atoll, while two airfields and a few houses were damaged in the Marquesas Islands. In the Indian Ocean, tropical cyclone Celesta formed briefly east of Mauritius. Villagers living around Indonesia's Mt. Merapi Volcano were warned to be ready to evacuate as the volcano gushed hot lava and burned 10 hectares of forest. Ash fell 30 km away from the 777-metre mountain. Wide areas of New South Wales were deluged by drought-breaking rain that caused serious flooding. Sydney was one of the worst-hit communities, with more than 254 mm of rainfall during a weekend of downpours. Farmers welcomed the rains which should reduce the state's declared drought coverage from 65 per cent to about 20 per cent. Three South Africans who went for an early morning dip in a coastside swimming pool were jolted awake by the realization that they were sharing the water with a visiting shark. The men, splashing around in a tidal pool in False Bay near Cape Town, alerted a nearby lifeguard who used nets and poles to force the 1.5-metre-long shark through a drainage gate, back out to sea. Tidal pools are popular walled-in structures built near the shore along the coast of Cape Province. An especially high wave must have washed in the shark. Additional Source: Meteo Franca, U.A.

The deluge left rivers bulging and roads flooded anew. It was the third destructive storm system to hit the state in a week. The storms have left at least eight people dead and five missing and caused $23 million in damage. Almost 40 centimetres of rain have fallen in some areas. Yesterday's storm, born in the Gulf of Alaska and fed by tropical El Nino conditions over the South Pacific, did not pack the river-bloating punch that came with storms earlier in the week. Still, it dumped more than 30 centimetres of snow in the northern Sierra Nevada, putting at least a dent in the state's 5-year-old drought and promising a big cash injection for ski resort operators.

Xianda,223,"THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 16, 1998 A9 WORLD Clinton signals he had affair with Lewinsky Will admit inappropriate relationship ZHANG YONGHONG, XINHUA Chinese news agency photo shows students from the Nanchang Military Academy working on the embankment for Jiujiang City on the Yangtze River yesterday. Catastrophe cover-up? Chinese flood toll much higher than officials are saying LIZ SLY Chicago Tribune JIAYU COUNTY, China - On the night of Aug. 1, a portion of the dike protecting the small town of Paizhou and half a dozen surrounding villages from the mighty floodwaters of the Yangtze River caved in, sending a wall of water cascading into adjacent villages. Moments earlier, citizens keeping guard over that portion of the dike had realized it was going to collapse and fled. Word reached the town's party secretary and mayor, who telephoned the army to send reinforcements. Then he hopped in his car and also fled. For those living in villages nearest to the dike, there was no warning. Many were submerged almost instantaneously. Between 8,000 and 10,000 people are missing, presumed dead. When the dike burst at 8 p.m., hundreds of the soldiers who were arriving to reinforce it also were swept away. Only one village was far enough away from the deluge for its residents to escape; a small group of them taking refuge in the county seat of Jiayu gave the above account of what appears to have been a major human tragedy in this flood-stricken corner of China's Hubei province. Two women rescued from the town of Paizhou told a similar story. Even though Paizhou was 19 kilometres from the spot where the dike burst, the waters quickly rose around it, turning the tiny town centre into an island surrounded by a vast lake. Zhang, one of the two women, also said that 10,000 people and at least 200 soldiers had died. On her boat journey to safety, she said she saw no sign of the six villages that had once surrounded the town. Although refugees' stories can't be officially confirmed, it seems clear some kind of catastrophe occurred. Yet there have been no reports of any such disaster in any Chinese news media. Newspapers have briefly reported that 13 people were drowned when a dike burst in the area, but an official with the local flood control office in Jiayu county insisted no one died when the dike burst. As millions of Chinese citizens engage in an epic battle to hold back the still-rising floodwaters of the mighty Yangtze River, another battle also is being waged, to hold back the truth about the human toll being exacted by the worst flooding in nearly 50 years. Foreign journalists have been denied permission to visit flood-stricken areas, and journalists attempting to visit without permission have been detained. Chinese media make no mention of disasters, preferring to focus on individual tales of heroism, such as that of a handicapped man dubbed ""the human sandbag"" by newspapers because he used his body to protect a hole in a dike. The government has announced with precision the number of hectares of farmland inundated (21.5 million), the number of houses destroyed (5.58 million), and the number of sandbags (2 million) and wooden piles (7,800) being deployed to protect dikes in one particular county in Inner Mongolia, also affected by flooding. The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Friday that floodwaters were threatening China's largest oil field and described how Heilongjiang, an industrial and agricultural province that borders Russia, mobilized one million civilians and soldiers for a ""round-the-clock fight"" against the flooded Nen and Songhua rivers. More than 200,000 people were reportedly fighting flooding in Daqing, where the oil field is located. About 20,000 people were evacuated from the breach in the dike, which expanded to 1,650 feet at one point, Xinhua said. But when it comes to human losses, details suddenly become elusive. Officially, the nationwide casualty toll in flooding stands at a vague ""more than"" 2,000 people. In the latest flooding near the oil field, miraculously, there were no casualties, even after a second dike broke yesterday, according to government media. Yet as floodwaters continue to rise along the river, it seems certain that the final toll from what is fast turning into a nationwide catastrophe also is going to rise. Water levels have now exceeded records set in 1954, when 30,000 people died, and with heavy rains forecast in the coming week, the situation is getting worse. Now, a major crisis also is looming in northern China. State media report that a 24-hour curfew has been slapped on the northern city of Harbin as the level of the Songhua River rose to 390 feet. The flooding on the Yangtze also threatens to worsen. As the season's fourth flood crest rolled downriver toward the sea, a fifth crest was barreling through the river's middle reaches threatening dikes and embankments already weakened by more than a month of flooding. A sixth crest was reportedly forming upriver. Though it is impossible to confirm officially the stories told by the refugees rescued from Paizhou, it seems clear some kind of catastrophe occurred. Some 24 kilometres away, a vast watery lake stretches as far as the eye can see. Only the occasional rooftop or factory chimney protruding from the water offers proof that not so long ago this seemingly placid lake was home to houses, factories and farms. ""The government told us not to say how many people died,"" said an elderly woman evacuated from her home alongside the dike, who is now living beneath a tarpaulin stretched between two beech trees. ""So I can only tell you that many, many people died."" Eventually, the waters will recede, allowing those who escaped to return home. The truth may never emerge, but it seems likely there are other Paizhous, other tragedies that have gone unreported. In the town of Shashi, 160 kilometres away, residents tell of 800 people who were swept away when a dike burst, engulfing a small village on the opposite bank in Gong'an county. A government official in Gong'an called the reports ""nonsense."" Shortly after the two-hour event, 1,000 anti-Nazi protesters gathered nearby. Police fired tear gas toward about 150 of them, who began throwing rocks and bottles and tried to pass police barriers to approach the Nazis. As the tear gas dissipated, bystander Axel Nielsen rubbed his eyes and said: ""You would think it was us who were the Nazis the way police treat us."" A clue to the government's coyness about civilian casualties is offered by a huge political poster that looms over the dike in the town of Shashi. It depicts Mao Tse Tung, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, the three generations of Communist China's leadership, standing shoulder-to-shoulder and gazing mistily across the Yangtze. ""Against the Floods,"" it proclaims. ""Bringing Happiness to the People."" A heavy toll in civilian life would represent a failure of that promise to the millions of people living along the banks of the flood-prone Yangtze River for whom happiness and combating floods are two sides of the same coin. The Yangtze River basin is one of China's chief sources of sustenance, supporting a third of the nation's population, supplying 40 percent of its grain, 70 percent of its rice and contributing 40 percent of its industrial production. ""The government told us not to say how many people died,"" Flood evacuee. But for a few weeks every summer, when the rains come and the river swells, it turns into China's biggest killer. Some 300,000 people have been killed by its floods this century. For hundreds of years, taming this unruly river has been a preoccupation of China's governments, and none more so than the Communist Party. ""The safety of the Yangtze River is tied to the state of the nation,"" the People's Daily sought to remind its readers in a front-page editorial Friday. Though the government can't be blamed for the extraordinary weather conditions that have caused this year's disaster, the devastation being wrought is also a symptom of the massive environmental problems looming over China after years of neglect. Erosion caused by deforestation on a massive scale along the once-pine covered banks of the river's upper reaches has increased the amount of silt the Yangtze carries on its journey to the sea, silt that is deposited along the way in the lakes that once served to hold its floodwaters and on the bed of the river. The pressure of population growth and the quest for improved yields has compounded the problem. Farmers have reclaimed land that properly belongs to the river, turning lakes that should serve as reservoirs for floodwater into farmland. The vast Dongting Lake has shrunk by more than half over the past century, to 2,600 square kilometres. In Hubei province, the number of lakes has declined from 1,332 in the early 1950s to 843 in the 1980s, the official Xinhua news agency said. Deprived of its natural sources of drainage, the swollen river seeks refuge wherever it can find an outlet, and this year its escape from its embankments appears to have been facilitated by the weaknesses in the crude earth dikes that offer the only protection against flooding for millions of people. Police detained about 20 Nazis and 31 anti-Nazi protesters for carrying slingshots, clubs or illegal weapons. Hess killed himself Aug. 17, 1987, at Berlin's Spandau prison. Past anniversary marches in Denmark, which was occupied by German troops from 1910-45, have ended in violence. ASSOCIATED PRESS WASHINGTON - President Bill Clinton will acknowledge an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky when he answers to a grand jury Monday, two advisers said yesterday. For the first time, the president signaled he had a sexual relationship with her, the advisers said. The advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Clinton let his lawyers and aides know late yesterday he had a sexual relationship with the former White House intern. ""He may not have used the word 'sex' but he has finally broken through that barrier,"" said one of the advisers. ""He has crossed the Rubicon,"" said the second. The second adviser, a longtime confidant, said the president had already disclosed the relationship to his wife, Hillary, even as he steadfastly denied the relationship publicly. The advisers cautioned the president could still change his strategy in the hours before his testimony. The advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Clinton still intends to tell the grand jury only that he had an ""inappropriate"" or ""improper"" relationship, insisting further details should remain private. But his lawyers expect Clinton will be forced to tell the grand jury he had sex with Lewinsky, the sources said. If Clinton makes a public statement, he would likely admit to an inappropriate relationship or encounters but would go no farther, said the sources. Clinton's lawyers worried any sort of concession to a relationship with the former White House intern would increase the president's legal jeopardy. The unprecedented grand jury testimony tomorrow will be a dramatic culmination of months of sensational and titillating revelations. Clinton's testimony could be a huge step toward political survival - or deeper peril. One adviser involved in preparing the president for Monday said Clinton is having trouble focusing on the chore - distracted by world events, late-night card games and a hankering for golf. After several hours with his lawyers yesterday, Clinton, in shorts and sneakers, stretched his legs with a jog on the South Lawn of the White House and tossed a ball for his dog, Buddy. Two advisers who have talked with Clinton or his wife in recent days said the atmosphere is somewhat tense when the two are together but she has shown no obvious signs of anger. Landslide Brenner Pass closed, Reuter BOLZANO, Italy - At least five people were killed early yesterday when a huge rock and mudslide hit cars on the Italian side of the main highway linking Austria and Italy, police said. The five dead were found in two cars. At least two of the victims were believed to be German tourists. A rescue worker told reporters the bodies in the two cars were ""horribly mutilated."" The Brenner Pass highway, the main road linking Italy with Austria, was closed. Rail traffic and a parallel secondary road were also cut. Police said the death toll could rise if URGENT PUBLIC AUCTION CONFISCATED AND UNPAID CARGO NEW HAND-KNOTTED PERSIAN & ORIENTAL CARPETS Rare 5ct Round Brilliant Cut Diamond Ring est.

Property identification required upon entry. Some reserves may apply. Additions of donations may vary. Legal sources confirmed Friday that Clinton was discussing with his advisers a possible strategy for describing an intimate, perhaps sexual, relationship with Lewinsky. These sources argued his sworn denial of ""sexual relations"" with Lewinsky is technically truthful under a tortured interpretation of the definition provided to Clinton during a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment case. Under their scenario, Clinton would refuse to provide details he considers private but would signal to the grand jury and later the country that the relationship went beyond mere friendship, the source said. Early yesterday, it was learned the scenario had taken hold among the president's hardline advisers. Advisers said the language of a possible explanation of the relationship was being discussed. Indeed, there was concern about using the phrase ""improper"" because Clinton specifically said in January he did not have an improper relationship; some advisers have suggested the word ""inappropriate."" ""Going down this road creates another problem for Clinton: why didn't he acknowledge it sooner? That's why some advisers think Clinton must also express regret for prolonging the presidential crisis."" Rahm Emanuel, a top White House aide, refused to speculate about Clinton's intentions late last night. ""I only know that he will testify truthfully and completely,"" Emanuel said, echoing Clinton's earlier statement. Even if he provides the public little or no new information about his relationship with Lewinsky, a legal source who consults with Clinton said the president may well be forced to tell the grand jury more. ""It's one thing to wink and nod to the press. It's another thing under oath to refuse to answer questions and be evasive,"" the legal source said. The president's lawyers will accompany him tomorrow and could try to limit the scope of questioning because he will not be under subpoena. Many of Clinton's political advisers assume if he provides intimate details to the grand jury, the information will eventually leak to the public. Their hope is by the time the details emerge, the public will have already accepted Clinton's explanation and be eager to move on. A familiar pattern.

Dated at Montreal on November 10, 2000 TD Trust Company, 600 de Maisonneuve Blvd, West, Suite 2920, Montreal, QC, H3A 3J2 WORLD BRITISH STORMS A rainy isle at best of times but now, SARAH LYALL New York Times YALDING, England - True, hordes of locusts have not yet emerged from nowhere in a demonstration of divine wrath. But after the rains, the floods, the wind storms and the torrents of raw sewage, the residents of this little country village would not be particularly surprised if they did. ""Do you want to be really depressed?"" asked Ian Scott, 55, beckoning down the path of his soggy garden, which did not smell very good, having been deluged by sewage-contaminated water three times in the last month. ""I'll show you what's left of our house."" It was a sobering sight. The floor was gone, stripped down to rotting wooden beams. The appliances were gone, having floated down the road or become so waterlogged by filthy water as to be unusable. And Scott and his wife are more or less gone, too. They are living in a rented house in a nearby village. Yalding is in a rolling valley in Kent, one of Britain's loveliest counties. Nestled picturesquely at the intersection of three rivers - the Teise, the Beult and the Medway - it is fortified to withstand the floods that come every year, spilling onto designated flood plains and lapping at doorsteps. But the village has not been at all prepared for the events of this fall: flooding so severe that firefighters have donned wetsuits and swam down the street, battling the current; flooding so severe that cars have floated away, houses have been destroyed and residents have had to be evacuated by boat. Were people in the rest of the country prepared for what happened to them? On and off since mid-October, Britain has been pummeled by rain, whipped by winds and buffeted by storms that have caused untold millions of dollars in damage, wreaked havoc with roads and trains, and left thousands of people without habitable homes. At least 12 people have been killed, mostly from trees falling on their cars as they tried to drive through the wind and rain. The army has been frantically distributing sandbags as communities try to shore up their defenses. In York, with water licking at the floor of his 13th-century residence, the archbishop of York said, ""I feel like Noah in his ark."" Meanwhile, government officials have begun to speak with a new plainness about the devastating effects of global warming, predicting that the freakish storms that have struck here and much of western Europe this autumn are harbingers of worse to come. So far this autumn, Britain - which was complaining of a drought two years ago - has endured 1.5 times the average autumn's rainfall, for the wettest fall since records began 273 years ago. ""The storms and floods being experienced across the UK are a wake-up call to the serious environmental threat posed by climate change,"" the environment minister, Michael Meacher, said Wednesday. ""Public opinion has underestimated just how drastic and severe these phenomena are, and it has brought it home to people better than a million political speeches."" The floods have had a domino effect. Train travel around much of Britain, already in chaos after a spate of accidents forced officials to cut train speed and to begin an emergency repair program, is now an improvisational prospect at best. On any given day, huge swaths of track might be closed for repairs. Some sections might be covered in water. Others might be littered with leaves and tree branches. And others might be buried in sludge. It has been doubly difficult for passengers because the train companies do not seem to know day by day, or even hour by hour, which services will be disrupted or for how long. ""Has this put people in a bad mood?"" asked a ticket agent at Victoria Station in London the other day, as the voice on the loudspeaker announced that the train to Gatwick airport had suddenly been canceled because of ""speed restrictions"" on the line. ""Everyone's always in a bad mood anyway, but now they finally have a reason."" ""I feel like Noah in his ark,"" the archbishop of York TOBY MELVILLE, AP An unidentified resident returns to her flooded home in York, England, yesterday, from the temporary accommodation where she had been living for the previous 10 days. The postal service has also been affected, with about 10 million first-class letters - one-eighth the daily total - delayed each day, mostly because the freight trains are running so sluggishly that the mail misses its next connection. In Lewes, Sussex, 35,000 letters and packages were soaked through when the post office was flooded, and then had to be destroyed after it was determined that they had been contaminated with raw sewage. At the Automobile Association, which monitors road conditions, operators have been scrambling to keep abreast of the latest dismaying information. ""It's been an absolute nightmare here,"" said Paul Scott, a spokesman for the group. ""A lot of main roads, minor roads and whole town centers have been completely cut off in some places. We're having to deal with flood warnings, road closures and trees falling, added to the usual rush-hour stuff."" None of this is really relevant just now to Kelly Bailey, 34, who wandered into the Yalding post office the other day to find out - as everyone in the village has been doing - the latest news. (A flood-damage meeting called for Tuesday night was canceled due to new flooding.) Bailey has been living in a strange suspended state since the first storm, in October, when the rivers burst their banks and began to roll down the street in an inexorable tidal wave that rose to her knees in a matter of moments. When that flood came, Bailey and her husband were just putting the finishing touches on the interior of the barn they had lovingly converted into a house. The kitchen had just been fitted; the carpets were on their way. The couple, who had been living next door in a trailer, planned to move in before Christmas. But as they stood, open-mouthed, a low growl turned into a roar, and a brown cascade of freezing water began to chase them down the street. ""We threw our rabbits and the dog into a truck,"" Bailey recalled. ""The kids - the 3-year-old had no underpants on, only a shirt, and the 10-year-old wasn't wearing shoes or socks. The rabbits were squealing with the water coming up into their cages."" The new house is ruined and the Baileys are back in the trailer (the rabbits and dog are living with Bailey's mother-in-law). But it seems that their troubles are not over. Meteorologists predict rain and more rain, and the feeling is that nothing is likely to return to normal anytime soon. As she looked up at the sky, Bailey was not at all happy to see the clouds gathering again. ""I'm keeping my fingers crossed,"" she said. ""But every time it rains now, I just feel sick."" Titanic's Winslet marooned, Page D13 Uganda's Ebola deaths rise to 100 KAMPALA, Uganda - Ugandan health officials say an outbreak of Ebola that has already killed 100 people is contained to two areas, but the death toll will increase as infected people die. Four people died of the virus in a 24-hour period. Authorities had hoped to keep the disease in Gulu, an area 360 kilometers north of the capital, Kampala, where the outbreak was first reported in mid-October. But last week, experts confirmed that a Ugandan soldier who had visited Gulu died of the disease in Mbarara, a town in the south. Yesterday, Alex Opio, the assistant commissioner for national disease control, announced that two men died of Ebola in Mbarara, 280 kilometers southwest of Kampala.

Xianda,225,"B3m i im u lil r THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, JULY 25, 1996 Obscene NBA salaries should face special tax GREGORY P. KANE BALTIMORE - Last Thursday, professional basketball star Shaquille ""Can't Hit a Free Throw"" O'Neal signed a seven-year deal with the Los Angeles Lakers worth a total of $120 million (US). Others also have done handsomely. Juwan Howard, formerly of the hapless and luckless Washington Bullets, jumped to the Miami Heat, whose owner will fork over $98 million over seven years. The Heat also re-signed Alonzo Mourning to a seven-year deal worth $105 million. According to Baltimore Sun sports writer Jerry Bembry, the Miami franchise is only worth $97 million. Allan Houston and Chris Childs - two guys not likely to make you forget the names Jerry West and Oscar Robertson - got $56 million and $24 million, respectively, from the New York Knicks. The Seattle Supersonics bestowed a seven-year, $85 million contract on Gary Payton. The Indiana Pacers will hand out $80.5 million and $38.5 million over the next seven years to Dale Davis and Antonio Davis, respectively. Dikembe Mutombo will get $50 million from the Atlanta Hawks over the next five years. Hakeem Olajuwon, who at least has two NBA championships and an MVP award, will get $55 million from the Houston Rockets over the next five years. This orgy of generosity on the part of National Basketball Association owners is not exactly guided by the merit system. Olajuwon, clearly a better player than either Howard or Mourning, will make less per year than each of them. With such dough to throw around, you'd think the NBA would sock some into the pension fund to reward all those old-timers who made the game great. I'm talking about guys like West and Robertson, as well as Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, John Havlicek, Bob Cousy and Earl Monroe. If the amount of money being doled out seems obscene, that's because it is. ""Money doesn't talk, it swears,"" that great songwriter, poet and philosopher Bob Dylan assures us. But let's not begrudge these guys their wealth, their obvious inferiority to players of the past notwithstanding. The money is generated by ticket sales and advertising revenue. I've heard people say it's a shame professional athletes make so much money while teachers make so little. It is a shame, but the analogy is weak. When was the last time you stopped by your neighborhood school and plopped down 50 bucks to watch an algebra teacher help a class master the finer points of a quadratic equation? It's just not done. But there is a disturbing connection about the NBA's willingness to dole out salaries in the megamillions and education: the trend over the past several years of basketball players leaving school early to jump to the professional ranks. In the past NBA draft, more than 20 players were underclassmen. A few were fresh out of high school - mere babes in the woods, their breath still reeking of Similac. There was a time when the NBA only drafted underclassmen who claimed financial hardship. That was when there was still the illusion that college athletes were actually getting the benefits of higher education. That was before college football and basketball themselves became big business. That was before the big-bucks deluge engulfed professional sports. The most galling part of the NBA money binge is that everyone knows these athletes haven't a clue about what to do with all that loot. ""What's the difference between $80 million and $90 million?"" Bembry reported Payton as asking. ""You can't spend it all, anyway."" It seems that the Miami Heat offered Payton more than the $85 million Seattle eventually agreed to pay him. Thank God at least one player had enough conscience to put a limit on his greed. That Payton guy is actually on to something. There may yet be a way to satisfy those who feel teachers should be paid more money and those who feel there's something a tad amiss with NBA players being rewarded so handsomely. Put a special education tax on those NBA players making those millions - to be designated specifically for teachers' salaries. BALTIMORE SUN We need to start thinking about how to spend RICHARD GWYN TORONTO - Two reports from the financial house Richardson Greenshields chunked onto my desk a couple of days ago, and, by luck, I read them in exactly the right order. The first was a chronicle of Canada's contemporary economic woes. Retail sales remain indifferent. Prices of new houses continue to fall. Full-time employment growth is sluggish. The second, about the Canada of tomorrow, might have been describing a different country. As a ""payoff"" for all the years spent fighting deficits and restructuring our industries to equip them to compete internationally rather than just with each other behind tariff walls, ""There is compelling evidence that Canada has entered a new era,"" declared this second report. Canada, it forecast, is set to outperform the U.S. A3 III), M It W M P h H M M M M li or hinder? Wrfiet dm morrow THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, JULY 25, 1996 I ma SARAH SCOTT THE GAZETTE The Quebec government is to report tomorrow on whether the operators of dams in the Saguenay region made mistakes that aggravated the disastrous weekend flood. Companies that operate the region's dams, including Abitibi-Price, Stone Consolidated and Hydro-Quebec, have been ordered to report to the province on how they handled the rising waters caused by a freak rainstorm that dumped enough rain to fill up lakes several times over. The report is being drafted amid allegations from local engineers, residents and politicians that the companies operating the dams might have contributed to the disaster. Serious questions are being raised about a dam at the mouth of Lac Ha! Ha!, operated by Stone Consolidated. During the deluge, water from the lake overflowed, crushed one of the dikes and surged down the river to La Baie, destroying houses in its path. RETURN Victims pick up $2,500 advance on aid program CONTINUED FROM PAGE A1 day and an equal amount today. But several hundred people in the Saguenay-Lac St. Jean region, most notably in the ravaged town of La Baie, will probably have to wait months before their houses are either repaired or rebuilt from scratch. Jonquiere mechanic Andre Dallaire, 54, was anxious to settle back into his home on du Barrage St. But a quick survey of his property revealed that it was badly in need of repairs. ""It's much worse than I thought,"" Dallaire said, estimating the damage at $15,000. ""I'll probably have to wait two months before I can move back in. That's a big problem because I work in my garage and it's half-full of water."" Local health authorities reported a surge in requests for psychological counseling. ""People are now beginning to realize the full significance of the devastation,"" said Luc Legault of the Saguenay-Lac St. Jean regional health board. ""Our social workers and psychologists are noticing that a lot of people are under great stress as they realize that they have lost their homes and will have to wait months."" Flood victims were able for the first time yesterday to pick up at banks an advance of $2,500 per household as part of a federal-provincial $200 million financial-aid package. Ottawa also is planning exceptional measures to provide unemployment insurance to people who have lost their jobs because of flood damage to stores and factories, federal Labor Minister Alfonso Gagliano announced yesterday during a tour of the region. Transport Quebec has reopened most main roads and Bell Canada has restored about half of the 26,000 disconnected phone lines. In downtown Chicoutimi, residents who had to leave their dwellings when their electricity and water supply were cut off were allowed to return on a street-by-street basis. Emergency officials checked their identification carefully and inspected each building for damage and fire risks before granting access. Many returning evacuees expressed frustration over the slow pace but said they were happy to be going home. In Laterriere, eight kilometres upstream on Riviere Chicoutimi, returning residents found extensive damage. ""The basement is a total loss,"" resident Jean-Francois Cote said. ""It's still filled with eight feet of water."" Defence Minister David Collenette flew over the region in the morning before arriving at Canadian Forces Base Bagotville. He praised the helicopter pilots who have carried out rescue operations since the flooding began last Friday night. In La Baie, the Saguenay's hardest-hit community, crews using heavy machinery worked round the clock to repair the devastation. During an afternoon press conference, local officials issued a final tally of the effects of the disaster, which killed two children and destroyed 199 houses and 13 businesses. Another 216 residences were heavily damaged and 4,500 people moved out. Officials said at least 2,500 evacuees will be unable to return to their residences for more than two weeks. For some returning residents, the devastation was too much to bear. One crying woman buried her face in her husband's chest. Another man, who would only give his name as Jerome, said he was just happy to be alive. ""My yard was washed away, but that's not serious,"" he said, clutching a garbage bag full of clothes. ""At least the house is still there."" An Ultramar gas station, a convenience store and a caisse populaire were among the neighborhood businesses that were washed away. Some residents grumbled when authorities were unable to tell them when they will be able to return home. ""There isn't any running water or electricity,"" one man said. ""It could be two more days or two more weeks before I can come back."" Chicoutimi engineer Jean Vallee, a geography professor at the Universite du Quebec a Chicoutimi, said yesterday that the company might have failed to open all of the floodgates in the dam that held the water in Lac Ha! Ha! Vallee said he visited the dam on Saturday, after helping rescue dozens of stranded people in La Baie, and he noticed that only one of three floodgates was open. Vallee said he thinks the failure of floodgates to open at Lac Ha! Ha! contributed to the mess because there was nowhere for the rising water to go but over a dike that subsequently crumbled because it was made of earth. If the floodgates had been opened, the flood would have been less severe, Vallee said. But Denise Dallaire, spokesman for Stone Consolidated, doubted the company could have prevented the damage. All the waterways in the area already were swollen by the rain before its reservoir emptied. ""What could you do? The water was coming from the sky,"" she said. ""The situation deteriorated so much so fast there was no way anybody could foresee it."" Civil-protection authorities could not confirm yesterday whether the floodgates at the Lac Ha! Ha! dam opened properly. But Marc Lavallee, an engineer with the civil-protection agency, said the floodgates wouldn't have made much of a difference even if they had opened. The storm dumped so much water into the lake that it would have overflowed whether the floodgates were open or not, he said. ""It's like emptying a bathtub into a sink. Whether the sink was empty or not, it would have overflowed anyway."" At Lac Kenogami, which feeds two rivers that run into Jonquiere and Chicoutimi, the floodgates were opened by remote control on Friday and Saturday. Guy Morin, a professor at the Institut National de Recherche Scientifique, said the floodgates operated properly and the dams reduced the extent of flooding. But historian Russel Bouchard, who has chronicled the region's history, said the flooding was unprecedented. MARCOS TOWNSEND, GAZETTE Internet, worked Montreal streets yesterday to collect money for flood victims. The Red Cross has amassed almost one-quarter of the $2 million it seeks. The total stood at $461,900 yesterday and the list of organizations rallying to the cause of the flood victims of the Saguenay area continued to grow. Even the ponies at Blue Bonnets are helping out. The Hippodrome de Montreal announced yesterday that it will hold a telethon this weekend with all proceeds going to the Red Cross fund. The telethon will be broadcast on the internal Hippodrome television channel and beamed to 18 betting parlors around the province. ""We'll be reaching an audience from Alma to Saint-Jean,"" said Hippodrome information officer Michel Beaudoin. Hardware chain Ro-Na Dismat will hand $100,000 to the Red Cross and provide $250,000 worth of tools, lamps and other household items. Clothing, sleeping bags, blankets and toys are being collected at the riding office of Liberal MP Clifford Lincoln in the Lachine-Lac St. Louis area. If you have any items you would like to donate, take them to 185 Dorval Ave., Suite 202, Dorval, between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. Monday to Friday. The items will be taken to Executive Forwarding in Old Montreal for transport to the stricken area.

Add the Bank of Montreal, the National Bank of Greece and Canada Trust to the list of financial organizations accepting donations to help the flood victims of the Saguenay valley.

The three alumni associations at Concordia University, which has launched its own fundraising campaign to help flood victims, appealed yesterday to alumni groups across Canada. ""People I've been talking to across the country all want to help - they just want to know how,"" said John Freund, who is coordinating Concordia's effort. In the Toronto area, a small freight forwarding company that appealed to Ontarians on Monday to donate emergency supplies has hired five extra employees to handle the calls, sort through the material and prepare it for shipping to the disaster area. ""The three phone lines have been going since 7:30 a.m.,"" company president David Aiello said yesterday. Freight Forwarders International is preparing to send several truckloads of clothes, blankets, sleeping bags and food. ""People are donating all kinds of things - we have three refrigerators, tea kettles, a television set,"" Aiello added. He said the response has been overwhelmingly positive.

Floods, sweat and tears in Europe Extreme weather continues AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE London - Extreme weather continued to hit Europe yesterday with the death toll from a heat wave in Romania, Austria and Bulgaria rising to 18 and hundreds facing another night of misery in flood-drenched England. A total of 11 people have now died in Romania amid a heat wave that led to five deaths in Austria and two in Bulgaria. In England, meanwhile, the problem was not heat but rain, causing the second serious outbreak of flooding within a month. People in many parts of the country were being advised not to travel. Rail company First Great Western told would-be passengers to stay at home, while thousands of motorists were stranded for hours as highways in some parts of the country came to a standstill. Weather forecasters had severe weather warnings for a thick band of southeastern and eastern England. In Worcestershire, in the badly hit west central region of the country, more than 1,000 people were spending last night in temporary accommodation. Military helicopters have rescued more than 100 people from rooftops, trailer parks and a bridge as well as strips of land cut off by water since rains hit on Friday. At Stratford-upon-Avon in central England, the Royal Shakespeare Company was forced to cancel two performances after its riverside theatre was flooded. More storms were expected late yesterday and today although on a less severe scale. After 141 flights to and from London's Heathrow Airport were cancelled on Friday and passengers were being reissued tickets yesterday, flights were running normally. Stewart Wortley, a government meteorologist, said 142.6 millimetres of rain fell in Pershore, Worcestershire, on Friday and 43 millimetres fell in one hour in south London on Friday. The latest bad weather came after four people died in floods in June, and thousands of people are still homeless after flood damage in central and northern England. A flash flood that tore through a remote mountain village in northwest Pakistan has killed at least 56 people and left dozens missing and feared dead, a local official said yesterday. Rescue workers were searching for more bodies after the flood on Friday, brought by torrential rains, swept away hamlets in the Upper Dir district in North West Frontier Province, said local official Subhan Khan. Four Afghan refugee girls died when the roof of their mud house collapsed in a heavy downpour in the provincial capital, Peshawar, overnight, said local official Ibrahim Qasimi. The death toll from fierce rainstorms and flooding in China continued to rise yesterday as the government scrambled to step up relief and prevention efforts, state press reported. In eastern Shandong province, the toll rose to 40 dead and nine missing as of Friday night, following a week of record rains that deluged the provincial capital, Jinan, and surrounding areas, Xinhua news agency said. By yesterday more than 559,000 people had been affected by flooding in Shandong and 112,600 evacuated as water levels on the nearby Yellow River and in surrounding reservoirs remained above warning lines, the report said. Meanwhile, the death toll in Chongqing in China's southwest rose to 42 people and 12 missing from torrential downpours that have affected up to 6.8 million people since Monday. More than 292,000 people have been evacuated in the mountainous region along the Yangtze River, with more than 100,000 homes damaged and crops on about 175,000 hectares of farmland destroyed, Xinhua said.

Baril insisted that none of the road floods were caused by sewer backup, as was the case on several occasions in the 1987 storm. ""We checked our system and everything was working fine,"" he said. ""We just had a lot of rain, that's all."" The fierce storm began about 3 p.m. and cut a swath between weather stations in Dorval and St Hubert - two cities where virtually no precipitation was recorded. Because the storm fell between the weather stations, where rainfall levels are measured, it may take a couple of weeks before it is known exactly how much rain fell. The Montreal area had already been enduring a week of wet, ragged weather before yesterday's outburst. The average weekly rainfall for Dorval is 19.3 millimetres, but by yesterday it had already hit 53.4 millimetres. By 3:30 p.m. yesterday, the westbound Bonaventure Autoroute underpass leading toward Nun's Island was submerged in almost three feet of water and had to be closed as cars began to stall and float. ""The water was coming up to my windshield,"" said Oliver Auvray, 28, a Nun's Island resident who was one of the last to make it through the underpass before it was closed. ""My car was about to give out,"" he said. ""But just as it was about to give out, I gave the gas a boost and it went out of the underpass."" About 20 vehicles had pulled over to the side of the road, fearful to use the underpass, he added. The water level was so high, Auvray said, it would have been impossible for him to open his doors without flooding the car. Provincial police moved in and closed the underpass, as well as the exit from Highway 15 north to the eastbound Bonaventure Autoroute, which leads downtown. Lucie Boult, a Sûreté du Québec spokesman, said that both exits were reopened by about 6:30 p.m. Transport-Quebec reported that the Mountain St. exit on the eastbound Ville Marie Expressway was also shut down for about a half-hour at the height of the storm because too much water was collecting. Around Montreal, city crews were also working to disperse floods on roads and in tunnels. The heavy rains knocked down some trees in the west end of the city, while several basement floods were reported in Rivière des Prairies.

Freak deluge hits Verdun, Montreal recalling '87 storm GEOFF BAKER THE GAZETTE Parts of Verdun, Nun's Island and Montreal were deluged yesterday by freak thunderstorms that caused floods in homes, offices and on nearby highway exits. Gilles Baril, public works director for Verdun, said last night that the flooding around his city was worse than the flood of July 1987 - which caused millions of dollars in damage to the Montreal area. ""From the results that we've seen visually, it's worse than in 1987,"" Baril said, adding that his office had already received about 300 complaints concerning floods in homes and buildings. ""There was so much water so suddenly and quickly that the whole sector was hit very hard,"" he said. ""There were several feet of water in places."" The commercial sector of Nun's Island, near Place du Commerce and Île des Sœurs Blvd, was hit particularly hard. Most of the indoor floods were caused by pipe problems.

""Every day in this country women are maligned, humiliated, shunned, screamed at, pushed, kicked, punched, assaulted, beaten, raped, physically disfigured, tortured, threatened with weapons and murdered,"" says the panel's final report, released yesterday. The panel, appointed by former prime minister Brian Mulroney, made 494 recommendations to further women's equality and eliminate tolerance for violence against women. Mary Collins, the federal women's minister, said the government would implement a policy and philosophy of zero tolerance for violence. But Collins would not promise to spend any new money on the problem and she played down the fact that the report recommended a number of policies her government has rejected or cut. Those policies include a national child-care program, core funding for women's shelters, sexual-assault centres and women's organizations, a program to fund court challenges by women fighting for equality rights and mandatory violence sensitivity training for judges. ""Our record is not bad,"" said Collins. But Mary Clancy, Liberal MP and critic for women's issues, said the report's recommendations aren't new, aren't specific enough and aren't based on hard data. Many contradict current government policy. ""I'd toss the report out the window,"" said Clancy. ""If the government wants to do something it can reinstate the court challenges program and ban military assault weapons."" The government has cancelled the program which funds legal challenges to assert women's equality rights, as well as cut funding for women's shelters and low-income housing and abandoned a national daycare plan. These are all things the report recommends. ""We can't continue to do this work if we don't have the money,"" said Karen Morehouse, who works at a centre for abused women and children in Ottawa.

Witnesses said about 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers crossed the border to reinforce Israeli troops in the zone. The drive, the biggest in Lebanon since Israel invaded its neighbor in 1982, raised fears of a ground offensive. In addition, Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded dozens of targets for the fifth straight day as diplomatic efforts intensified to arrange a ceasefire. The UN secretary-general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, criticized the Israeli attacks, which have reportedly devastated dozens of Lebanese villages and sent hundreds of thousands of people fleeing north. ""The policy of deliberately forcing people to abandon their homes must be stopped forthwith, and those who have been displaced should be enabled to return in peace and safety,"" he said yesterday. Nearly 500,000 refugees, more than 10 per cent of Lebanon's population, have fled north toward Beirut in a ""human catastrophe of tragic magnitude"" since the Israeli push began Sunday, Lebanese Health Minister Marwan Hamadeh said in Beirut yesterday. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin acknowledged that there had been discussions with the United States on ways to stop the fighting, but asserted that the army would pursue its campaign against guerrillas who yesterday fired new salvos of Katyusha rockets into northern Israel. ""The main objective is to ensure that the settlements and residents in Israel will not be hostage to the Party of God in its clashes with the Israel Defence Forces,"" Rabin said. ""As long as the objectives of the operation have not been achieved, there will be no halt to IDF activity."" The army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, said the offensive would continue until the rocketing of Israeli settlements was stopped.

Colin Atkinson sat in a tiny makeshift room he shares with four family members and softly strummed his guitar, The shy young man with the ponytail and gentle eyes is among about 400 flood evacuees from the Roseau River Reserve who have made the Ste Anne curling rink their temporary home, For two weeks, they've been close, sometimes too close, with whole families living in areas the size of a small bathroom, the lines of privacy drawn with blankets, towels and free-standing room dividers, They eat side by side at long tables, line up for showers at the industrial trailer outside and sign up to do their laundry at the single, constantly churning washing machine, If there's a quarrel, everyone hears it If it rains, everyone's inside, They all try to get along, They have to, They have another two weeks to go before they can return to their reserve in the flooded Red River Valley It's not bad for me, Atkinson said with a shrug, his music blending with the chatter of a nearby television, where a group of children are watching the Ricki Lake talk show, They must wait for the repair of roads washed away by floodwaters, The houses within the ring-diked reserve 50 kilometres south of Winnipeg are OK except for a few with sewer backup in their basements, The natives are among about 20,000 people who remain out of their homes as water from Manitoba's worst flood in a century gradually recedes, Like most of the other evacuees, half of the reserve was put up in hotels or in homes of friends or relatives, The other half of the reserve is in this predominantly francophone community of 1,500 about 35 km east of Winnipeg, About 75 local people have pitched in to make meals, organize outings, obtain supplies and entertain the 125 children, They've just been there, they've been great, evacuee Susan Powers said of the Ste Anne community, Town councillor Guy Deschambault added: At first, there was a certain amount of uneasiness because we were all strangers, But as time went on, people seemed to accept more and more, We've created a new friendship, a new bond between two communities which will last for a long time, Deschambault was proud to help in collecting willow branches to build a sweat lodge behind the grounds of the town's graceful spired church and old monastery, In the evenings, a campfire blazes in front of the low, round sweat lodge hut, with sounds of drumming and chanting coming from within, Even though I was raised around native people when I was younger, we didn't learn much, Deschambault Winnipeg kids predicted deluge in February study SCOTT EDMONDS Canadian Press WINNIPEG - Forget the highly trained flood forecasters-Just ask the kids, Eighty-one per cent of Grade 7 students at Winnipeg's Sargent Park school who took part in a national study said months ago their city might be in danger of flooding this year That compares with just 69 per cent nationally who felt a flood might hit their neighbourhood, said Kate White, who conducted the federally funded research as part of the United Nations decade for natural disaster reduction, Even in Toronto, where flood warnings had been issued about the same time as the survey, only 70 per cent of children at North York schools felt a flood might hit their neighbourhood, White said 20 per cent of the Winnipeg children thought a flood was very likely, compared with just 6 per cent in Toronto, At first blush, the results appeared puzzling, White noted that in February, Winnipeg schoolkids weren't being bombarded with flood news as they have for the last month or more as the worst flood in almost 150 years submerged the Red River Valley, The survey was done when emergency officials were concerned about the possibility of flooding but by and large not when it was in general public discourse, White said, She spoke at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine rivers in downtown Winnipeg where high water still covers the docks and riverside paths, The children themselves said they just had to look out the window to know what was coming, There was lots of snow, we had a large amount of snow, said Heather Brereton, 13, taking a break from class in the library at Sargent Park, MANITOBA FLOOD, JOE BRYKSA, CP Grande Pointe resident Ed Hanna, the third generation on the homestead, returned home yesterday afternoon to find 100-year-old photographs of his grandparents damaged by the Red River floodwaters, said, Now we're learning by leaps and bounds, A volunteer security force of about 20 reserve residents and townspeople works around the clock to guard against vandalism and other problems, So far, there have been no incidents, Jackie Mourant, the town's evacuation coordinator, was walking about briskly with a cellular phone in hand, pointing out the features of the mini-village that was thrown up overnight The arena snack bar has become a TV and game room, the trophy room is a daycare centre, a drink refrigerator is full of medicine, including tetanus vaccines that every member must receive before returning home, One storage room is devoted entirely to diapers and infant formula, There's no way I could have done this without training from the EMO (Emergency Management Organization), Mourant said, We had staged mock disasters, so you get the feel for it, In Winnipeg, Mayor Susan Thompson announced the establishment of a special fund to help the city pay for the disaster, And 60 more families evacuated from their homes in Winnipeg will be going home today About 4,600 people in Winnipeg are out of their homes, But more are expected to return over the weekend, The city also began removing a few layers from the top of sandbag dikes in some neighbourhoods along the river to prevent riverbank erosion as water levels drop, At Emerson, near the border with the United States, essential-services personnel were allowed to return to help prepare for the re-entry of the rest of the town's 750 residents, Snow was certainly the villain in the drama, Winnipeg already had almost twice as much snow as usual when it got hit with a record April 5 blizzard that was the final straw for an overloaded river After watching almost nothing but flood on television for the last month, Brereton and three classmates who also took part in White's study are a walking library of facts and impressions, They know how many troops were fighting the flood-8,500, Which town got hit the hardest - Ste Agatha And they're certainly not shy when it comes to saying who deserves praise for the flood fight - the army and volunteers - and who doesn't - Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Here, I'll shake your hand, said a grinning Lara Farthing-Nichol, 12, referring to Chretien's awkward visit to the dikes the day before he called the June 2 election, He didn't make any sandbags or anything, added Angelito Panganiban, 13, who said if there's another flood next year, he might get to do a little sandbagging himself, Farthing-Nichol was more impressed with those army dudes, All four admitted the idea of another flood was just a bit scary, As for the chances, Brereton said that's easy, It depends on how much snow we get, Charles Quinit, 12, also has advice for those who want to prepare: Store a lot of sandbags, White is going to get the Winnipeg children to take the survey again now that they've gone through the flood and compare the results, It's a chance researchers don't often get, she said, Among other things, she said her study of risk and how it is perceived can be used to prepare course materials for schools to help students cope better with natural disasters, It involved 1,000 children nationwide.",0,19970510,modern,Deluge,1,0,0,1,0,0,

But, they added, the risk of allergic reactions and infections was certainly higher in homes where cleaning was delayed. ""It's a big, big problem,"" said Maryse Harrison, emergency-services director at CLSC Saint-Hubert. ""A lot of people are not insured, and for those who are it takes an enormous amount of time to inspect the damage."" The result, Harrison said, is that ""people find themselves coping with walls or floors that they can't take out and furniture they can't get rid of."" They wonder whether they're going to be paid if they get rid of things. Harrison herself was hit by flooding at her Delson home - and it triggered her asthma so badly she moved out for a week while the damage was cleaned up and her home dried out and disinfected. ""I moved all my furniture outside, and disinfected the next day. But what happens under your floor you don't see, and that's where it's most dangerous."" The flooding last month was terrible. Deluged by record rainfall that also hit other parts of Quebec, 8,000 homes in 66 municipalities on the South Shore were damaged when more than 150 millimetres of rain fell in 30 hours between late Nov. 7 and Nov. 9. Saint-Hubert was among the hardest hit; 2,000 households have filed damage claims. Chambly had 600 claims, many of them from people too ill or poor to clean up the damage before it affected their health. ""The people who really had problems were those who didn't have the money to go ahead and do the cleaning promptly,"" said Chambly's executive director, Michel Merleau. ""Other people shot video and took photos of all the damage to their home and then just stripped the joint,"" he added. Insurance claims for the flooding are rising across the South Shore, and companies are coping with tremendous demand, said industry spokesman Anne Morin. ""We're talking several thousand claims; so far, it's up to $41 million, and we think it will wind up costing about $60 million by the time everything's settled."" Some insurance adjusters have been slow to get to every home early to inspect damage, but the problem should not lead to people falling sick, added Morin, communications director for the Insurance Bureau of Canada. ""I can't say it's impossible that adjusters have delayed visiting, because if you're an insurance company that is pretty concentrated in the market - say, that covers 2,000 homes - then perhaps, yes, there is a delay,"" she said. ""But people should not put their health in danger by holding on to their belongings. That is clear. They have a duty under their contract to protect their belongings, and that can mean avoiding any aggravation of the damage by leaving the home wet,"" she said. Before getting rid of things that are waterlogged, contaminated or rotting, homeowners should first photograph them or list each item, she added. ""Most homes are not covered for floods unless it's specified in their contract,"" she said. ""It isn't there automatically. At the high end, sewers backing up are often covered, but in basic contracts they aren't."" Linda Hansen of Chambly didn't have insurance. She and her husband awoke Nov. 10 to find the basement of their Gagne St. home flooded with sewer water. She and her husband, Tom, 47, used their swimming pool sump pump to get rid of most of the water, and set up dehumidifiers in the place. ""Then Tom started getting sick,"" she said. First it was a tightness in his throat, then ""smashing, instant"" headaches, then, after supper last Sunday, he felt as if his heart had seized. Tom is now in a hospital in St. Jean, under observation. ""Doctors don't know what he has, but Linda suspects bacteria from the flooding."" She got the idea after South Shore health officials sent out warning fliers this week. ""After the flood, we were running on exhaustion,"" Hansen said yesterday, admitting that her husband's health may have deteriorated because of simple stress. ""I can't rule that out,"" she said. But if doctors can't come up with a cause, she wondered, what better explanation than bacteria from the flood? Even in homes that have been cleaned and disinfected, mould and mildew can still be present and can ""cause or aggravate"" a number of health problems, the Monteregie regional health-board fliers pointed out. Those problems include coughs, congestion, runny noses, sneezing and noisy breathing; rhinitis, bronchitis and asthma; irritated eyes, throat and nose; skin problems; fever, headaches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Homeowners should use gloves when they clean up, and thoroughly ventilate parts of the house hit by flooding, the health board advises. Wet rugs should be thrown out and upholstered furniture thoroughly dried out - and if the smell of mildew persists, those items, too, should be junked. Objects that are kept should be disinfected with a solution of bleach and detergent, rinsed and dried out. ""People find themselves coping with walls or floors that they can't take out and furniture they can't get rid of. They wonder whether they're going to be paid if they get rid of things.""

Xianda,230,"A 12 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1996 A cable car in from labor mini Not enough safety checks, Rioux says by JACK BRANSWELL CANADIAN PRESS QUEBEC - Quebec's labor minister severely criticized a government agency yesterday for lax inspection of a cable car that crashed last weekend, killing one tourist and injuring 15 others. Matthias Rioux said he found it strange that the funicular, a popular tourist attraction, is only supposed to be inspected every five years. The Régie du Bâtiment du Québec has admitted that it was behind in its work and that the cable car had last been inspected in February 1990. ""A lift that carries that many people in a year - 400,000 - under normal circumstances should be inspected more frequently than every five years,"" Rioux said. Rioux also wondered about the quality of maintenance by Otis Canada, which serviced the lift. ""In my opinion, we have to also question the responsibility of Otis,"" he said. The funicular plunged the last 7 metres and crashed into the base of the ride after a restraining cable snapped last Saturday. Quebec law does not set out specific inspection schedules for lifts and elevators; that is left up to the judgment of the building inspection board. There are six ongoing investigations over the funicular crash, including one by a coroner who is investigating the death of British tourist Helen Toombs, 46. Rioux said he would wait for all the reports to come in before deciding whether to order changes in how Quebec's 14,200 lifts and elevators are inspected. ""If we have to toughen up the law or rules we will."" Rioux also ordered the building inspection board to come up with a new inspection plan for the province's more frequently used lifts. The board has called Otis inspectors into a meeting today to talk about their maintenance schedule. But Rioux said that according to a maintenance log, the company was up to date on its inspections. He also said the accident ""is sad and (one) is always too much,"" but it has to be put into perspective. Rioux said in the past 20 years, there has been only one other accident on all of Quebec's lifts and elevators. That incident concerned a teenager who had stopped an elevator between floors and then injured himself while trying to jump to a lower floor. Bureaucrats shrug off blame for July's flooding disaster by CLAUDE ARPIN THE GAZETTE CHICOUTIMI - Environment Quebec bureaucrats yesterday shrugged off all responsibility in last July's flooding disaster and virtually blamed local residents for courting danger by clamoring for high water levels in a government-run reservoir. The seven-member delegation from Quebec City emerged smiling and unscathed from a three-hour session before the Scientific and Technical Commission on Dam Management, a government body investigating the July 19-21 deluge that caused damage of $704 million and required the relocation of 15,000 people. With three mandarins in the witness box and another four seated in the audience, Quebec's dam experts systematically refuted every point raised by commission chairman Roger Nicolet and his five commissioners. The officials had testified last month but were ordered to face the commission again yesterday to answer more questions. This time, they argued that their management of Lake Kenogami was beyond reproach, even though all three dams on the 17-kilometre lake malfunctioned and some of its 10 dikes overflowed. Yvon Gosselin, director of the department's hydraulic division, said he'd been hearing for weeks that the cities of Jonquière and Chicoutimi might have been spared heavy flooding if Lake Kenogami's level had been low prior to the rainstorm. ""The fact of the matter is,"" said Gosselin, ""that when the lake's level dropped to 109 feet during the summer of 1995, we were pelted with insults by people who said we'd failed to anticipate the drought and had neglected to stock sufficient water supplies."" Gosselin added that a formal agreement worked out in 1982-84 between his department, local residents and industrial users required Environment Quebec floodgate operators to maintain the lake's level at 115 feet during summer months, ""to satisfy boaters and swimmers."" He said studies conducted by his department in recent weeks show that the lake's level would have had to have been at 87 feet to avoid flood damage when 27 centimetres of rain fell on the 52-square-km lake in a 72-hour period last July. ""But that wouldn't have honored the government's pledge to users along Chicoutimi River and Rivière aux Sables, with whom the summer-level management plan was negotiated."" Even if the lake had been at 94 feet and thus capable of absorbing much of the downpour, Gosselin said Environment Quebec would have been subject to harsh criticism: ""People simply would not accept that low a level in summertime."" He added that department studies show it would have taken 10.5 days prior to the downpour to bring the lake to that level without causing heavy flooding downstream. ""Whenever we have to raise the outflow rate to accommodate higher than usual runoffs, people are surprised."" ""Even if we'd decided to be at 103 feet on July 19, it would have taken 5.3 days to get there by emptying the lake at the rate of 960 cubic metres per second, or twice the flood ceiling, which is 480 cubic metres per second."" According to Bruno Robert, Environment Quebec's engineer in charge of the province's floodgate operators, Lake Kenogami is ""most difficult"" to manage in summertime. He likened it to a ""delicate balancing act"" that involves releasing just enough water but never too much. ""In the past 50 years,"" he added, ""the trend had been to minimize the effects of spring runoffs by gradually reducing the lake's outflow along the two rivers from 400 cubic metres per second to 250."" This kind of ""efficient management,"" he added, tended to make people feel more secure about building summer homes closer to the rivers. ""But whenever we have to raise the outflow rate to accommodate higher than usual runoffs, people are surprised and they say: 'See, they've mismanaged things again,' instead of saying, 'We shouldn't have built so close to shore.'"" Robert said that if Environment Quebec were to switch to a substantially lower reservoir level, ""summer sports and hydroelectric plants would take a beating."" He allowed that during the night of July 19, department officials could have opened the floodgates wider in anticipation of heavy rain. ""If we'd opened them at four or five in the morning, we would have drowned people in their sleep; that's not something we could do,"" Robert said. To a commissioner's concerns about the department's policy of managing water levels from Quebec City, Gosselin replied that similar ""long-distance"" techniques are common on other major bodies of water, including the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes. ""The duty engineer has access to all the pertinent data and when he goes home at night he takes his portable computer along."" Last July, he said, Roger Poulin - the duty engineer - had five operators on call at the lake's dams to open floodgates. ""You can be sure that he didn't sleep a wink Friday night (July 19)."" All three dams had malfunctioned, added Gosselin, because of the volume of water flowing over floodgates. ""The weight was simply too great for the electric motors that lift the huge wooden beams that act as doors on floodgates."" Robert told commissioners the mechanical breakdowns at all three dams were ""as unpredictable as when you take off for a trip and your car stalls by the side of the road."" The commission winds down today with a series of questions for managers of Stone-Consolidated Corp, a newsprint manufacturer whose Lake Ha! Ha! reservoir overflowed, flooding the town of La Baie. Lost handicapped boy found safe but hungry Jean-François Gagnon, a 16-year-old intellectually handicapped boy, was found safe yesterday after being lost for 19 hours in a dense forest near Mont Laurier, about 230 kilometres north of Montreal. ""He walked most of the night. He's tired and hungry, but otherwise he's alright,"" said Pierre Lemarbre of the Sûreté du Québec. Jean-François, who has the mental capacity of a child of 5 to 7, was taken to a Mont Laurier hospital, where he was reunited with his mother. He disappeared after leaving a Mont Laurier high school at about 4 p.m. Tuesday carrying a lunch and wearing only jeans and a windbreaker. The Sûreté launched a search with more than 30 police officers, 40 volunteers, a helicopter and a tracking dog. ""We were really worried for him because the temperature dropped to minus 6 overnight,"" Lemarbre said. ""You love for less Brand name women's fashions at discount prices.

consult your city hall for details Most supermarkets will be open but operating hours may vary Many retail stores will be closed It's one sort of drain problem when the expressway floods, another ""In the last three or four years, the phenomenon of flash-flood rain has become more common,"" said Andre Cantin, an Environment Canada meteorologist For the insurance industry, the new trend in rain is being watched very closely, because payouts to policyholders for water damage have risen in lock-step with the rising incidence of flash-flood rain While Huntingdon was weathering its storm, the principal director of the Insurance Bureau of Canada was in Quebec City ""It is imperative to build and rebuild our infrastructures with new climatic values in mind,"" Robert Tremblay of the Insurance Bureau of Canada warned delegates to the annual meeting of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities of the need to upgrade their infrastructures to take account of climate change ""It is imperative to build and rebuild our infrastructure with new climatic values in mind,"" Robert Tremblay said Chateauguay, St Constant and Chambly are among municipalities in the Montreal area that have been warned by insurance companies in recent years about the need to improve sewage drainage, according to Bertrand Marchand, director of government relations for the EBC's Quebec region In 2005-06, Quebec insurers paid out $500 million in water damages, or 45 per cent of $1.1 billion paid out overall This compares with just 21 per cent in 2001-02 This has resulted in the cost of insurance against water damage in Quebec rising steadily in the same period ""We've seen prices rise from $20 to $30 to $50 to $100, depending on the policy,"" said Norbert Bourgon of Assurances Bourgon of Huntingdon, established in 1887 Water-damage protection doesn't come automatically on residential home-insurance policies It has to be bought separately as part of an endorsement or a rider clause Even then, it only mainly covers flooding resulting from sewer backups Ordinary river flooding, like the kind of predictable flooding many riverside communities in Quebec see every spring, isn't insurable The jury is out on why rain is changing Some blame climate change; others say we're just going through a cycle The fact that eight out of the past 10 years in Quebec have been warmer than normal could mean that our rain has become more ""tropical"" in nature - more violent Or then again, maybe not It's really all just informed conjecture at this point ""Ten years is really a very short period of time in which to make judgments,"" said Peter Finlayson, an Ormstown farmer Start: 11 a.m. July 1 H Montreal CANADA DAY PARADE The streets that will be closed for St",0,20080630,modern,Deluge,1,0,0,0,0,0,

the words of British historian Donald Sassoon, The unleashing of market forces as a solution to mass unemployment is today a monument to human folly N HIS BOOK The Unconscious Civilization (which won the 1996 Governor-General's Award for non-fiction), John Ralston Saul portrayed the neo-conservative technocrats who clamor to cut the public sector as enjoying power without responsibility Their language becomes parodic, even nonsensical They will say that the nation is experiencing strong, real growth, and then, in the same paragraph, add that the nation is bankrupt Well, which is it? It is common today to run growth and bankruptcy together the way medieval Catholicism - through the Inquisition - would say God is strong, good and kind, therefore we must torture you Senior Liberals have stressed the need for Canada to be competitive in the global economy The prime minister has been insistent that in our foreign policy, trade must take precedence over human rights Opposing voices within the Liberal caucus and party are largely mute For in Chretien's words, The most important fact in the world of today is trade Hardly the stuff of traditional Liberalism But then, as former Tory prime minister Kim Campbell remarked on a visit to Montreal this year, Some of the policies they fought tooth and nail when we were in government are now their policies Estragon I sometimes wonder if we wouldn't have been better off alone, each one for himself We weren't made for the same road Vladimir: It's not certain Estragon No, nothing is certain Vladimir: We can still part, if you think it would be better At the year's last turning, Jacques Parizeau was still the premier of Quebec He left the job at the end of January, amid widespread relief Many sovereignists had been embarrassed by his offensive remarks on the night of the referendum Many federalists cordially loathed the man But the Lucien Bouchard who seized the reins of power was still, in certain respects, an unknown quantity His brilliant campaign during the referendum had made him not just the darling of Quebec nationalists, but also the only credible successor to Parizeau Famous for his short temper and his personal courage, he was also renowned for tailoring his loyalties according to the needs of the hour Now the hour was his What would he make of it? Against strenuous opposition from unions and powerful activists within the Parti Quebecois, he insisted on the urgency of reducing Quebec's budget deficit Left-wing ministers such as Louise Harel began to promise an overhaul of the costly welfare system In March, the premier delivered a speech in English at the Centaur Theatre before a crowd of invited anglophones; although the speech was devoid of specifics, Bouchard went on to resist pressure from within his own party to tighten the laws against the use of English Yet he remained committed to Quebec sovereignty And although his popularity slid from its Promethean levels, Bouchard is still by far the best-liked politician in Quebec His Liberal opponent, Daniel Johnson, looks flimsy by comparison In October, Johnson's predecessor, Robert Bourassa, lost a long and brave fight against cancer The reaction to his death highlighted the profound differences between French- and English-speaking Quebecers Among anglophones, the veteran premier had inspired only grudging respect; many of them suspected him of being a separatist in sheep's clothing The wounds he opened by the passage of Bills 22 and 178, which curtailed English linguistic rights, never entirely closed So in English Montreal, grief was muted But among francophones, Bourassa was widely mourned: as a leader with principles, not just a consummate pragmatist; as a man of informal charm and grace; and as a premier who had set Quebec's good before his own - even at great personal cost Among the trio of white, male, fatherly, French-speaking, late middle-aged Quebec politicians now at the helm of our lives (Jean Chretien, Lucien Bouchard and Pierre Bourque are all between 54 and 62 years old), it is the mayor of Montreal whose stature fell the furthest in 1996 Since his election two years ago, Bourque has displayed an almost touching incompetence The electorate has paid heavily for his lengthy on-the-job training But this fall, Bourque faced an allegation graver than mere ineptitude: that he took part in money-laundering during the 1994 campaign The charge, levelled by his former chauffeur, Maurice Brault, has not been fully answered When the city's interests were being ignored or downplayed in Quebec City, Bourque tended to keep his mouth shut According to the familiar rhetoric, Montreal is the motor of Quebec's economy; in truth, it makes up a good part of the bodywork, too The Montreal area, after all, has about 45 per cent of Quebec's population - but it pays roughly 60 per cent of Quebec's tax revenues Yet on issues like hospital closings, issues that touch the daily lives of his citizens, the mayor failed to intervene with any degree of success The city drifted, as though waiting for salvation - a salvation that like Samuel Beckett's Godot, showed absolutely no sign of materializing Bouchard appointed a bright lieutenant, Serge Menard, to look after Montreal; but Menard's expertise is legal, not economic And our economic problems are colossal Throughout the metropolitan area, the official unemployment rate has risen to nearly 13 per cent (the figure is even higher for the city of Montreal) In the last six months, Quebec has lost about 50,000 jobs - two-thirds of them in Montreal Over the same period, by contrast, 33,000 new jobs were born in Toronto And yet, as always, there's a caveat If you compare Montreal's quality of life with that in most other big cities around the world, you'll realize how lucky we still are In 1996, housing costs stayed reasonable Murder rates stayed low Air quality remained high Artistic life remained vibrant And of the Montrealers who left, most did so with regret The heavens opened; the earth gave way In the Saguenay-Lac St Jean region last July, more than 27 centimetres of rain fell in a 72-hour period Seven people died in the resulting floods Nearly 500 homes were destroyed Estimates of the damage now exceed $700 million The figures can't begin to suggest the human cost But was all this an act of God, as a shaken Lucien Bouchard suggested? In the Saguenay, few people believe it - especially in light of some damning testimony before a provincial commission in the fall Andre Fortin, an engineering professor at the Universite du Quebec a Chicoutimi, said that Quebec is riddled with potentially deadly dikes and dams - but people don't want to hear such news, because of the costs involved and the fact that too many homes in hazardous areas would be uninsurable We are still waiting to find out how steeply insurance rates across Canada will rise to meet the costs of the flood About $350 million is being paid out, much of it to companies like Stone-Consolidated - the giant papermaker whom many hold responsible for the damage downstream from Lake Ha! Ha!, where its antiquated dike gave way Yet under Canada's insurance rules, Saguenay homeowners will not be compensated We're also waiting for solid answers as to whether the clear-cutting of the region's forest, along with Quebec's haphazard maintenance of dams and dikes, were prime contributing factors in the disaster In a telling phrase, Jean Vallee, who teaches geotechnical engineering at Chicoutimi, called much of the flooding nature's revenge In the same month that the residents of Chicoutimi, Jonquiere and La Baie were battling the deluge, Hurricane Bertha flailed the Caribbean Large chunks of Rome, Bangladesh and southern China were also under water Maybe Waterworld-Kevin Costner's sodden epic - was better as prophecy than entertainment In 1996, it grew more and more clear that natural disasters are seldom purely natural any more Global warming, it appears, is no longer just a prediction One of its principal effects - an increase in violent, unpredictable storms - has already come to pass The consensus is that we are already outside the realm of natural variability, said Chris Flavin, vice-president for research at the WorldWatch Institute in Washington, D",0,19961228,modern,Deluge & tornado,1,1,0,0,0,1,
Xianda,233,"ELL ENTERTAINMENT Band's cult following a blessing and curse THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2000 CRIMSON Continued from Page EU King Crimson has maintained a connection to its past via a deluge of archival releases. A three-CD recording from the ConstruKction of Light tour's European leg has already been released. And then there's the King Crimson Collectors' Club, which distributes CDs of vintage Crimson to members. For details, visit the Web site www.disciplineglobalmobile.com. On stage, however, King Crimson is concerned with its present and future. When its current tour began, pre-Thrak material was absent from the set list. A few audience favourites have snuck in since then, but Gunn explains that the emphasis on new songs is a necessity in King Crimson's evolution. ""How do you get people to treat this as a new band? You don't do it by going out and playing the old hits. Also, if you don't play anything old, then you have a void and you have to write new stuff."" King Crimson's borderline-obsessive following is a blessing and a curse. It has allowed the group to pursue its own vision, free of the boundaries imposed by commercial considerations, but paradoxically keeps the group mired with one foot in the past. ""We have two kinds of fans,"" Gunn said. ""There are fans that know that the band evolves, and fans that don't want the band to evolve. I don't find it obnoxious, but people yell for us to play songs that this lineup could never play. It's only because the name King Crimson is there that they think we would play Cat Food (from 1970's In the Wake of Poseidon). We could have called the band something else. But they didn't, and the multitude of lineups that have operated with a common name validates Fripp's fondness for referring to King Crimson as 'a way of doing things.' And while the constantly mutating group offers little in the way of job security, Gunn actually uses the word 'fun' when talking about the present-day King Crimson. ""You never know what's going to happen with this band - whether we will even be working in four months. Being in King Crimson is like living in a state of complete uncertainty, and that's not fun. However, being on stage with this particular band is a lot of fun."" King Crimson performs tonight at 8 at Metropolis, 59 Ste.

But meteorologists said both short- and long-range forecasts held out hope that that region would not be pounded by prolonged heavy rains again this year. ""Over most of South Africa at least for December, January and February, our models are calling for normal to slightly below normal rainfall conditions,"" said Mark Majodina, a meteorologist at the South African Weather Bureau. In Mozambique, nine people were reported killed when storms, which started on Sunday, uprooted trees and destroyed flimsy homes. On Tuesday, Radio Mozambique reported that people in the southern Gaza province had begun moving to higher ground after heavy rain on Monday night. Gaza was one of the areas worst hit by floods in February and March that killed more than 700 people. The country, one of the poorest in the world, is still recovering from the disaster. In South Africa yesterday morning, police said they were searching for three people believed to have been washed off a bridge in eastern KwaZulu-Natal province, where 500 millimetres (19.7 inches) of rain fell in some areas from Sunday until Tuesday. Floods in South Africa last summer killed several people, affected crop production and pinched economic growth. While more showers were expected over KwaZulu-Natal province and southern Mozambique yesterday, the South African Weather Bureau said skies should start to clear today and temperatures should rise. In the longer term, Majodina said South Africa's Northern Province could see above normal rain patterns, according to forecasting models. This could still have an impact on Mozambique as some of the province's watersheds seep into South Africa's neighbour. Environmentalists say last summer's floods in Mozambique were exacerbated by the loss of vital wetlands and heavy rains in neighbouring countries. The erosion of wetlands and overgrazing of grasslands in upper watersheds of the Limpopo river in Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa channeled raging waters into its lower watersheds or catchments in Mozambique. ts;i: ' ran Sw&- i ( t 1 V VTdeotron Channel 63 (Montreal-CkX, Digital Service 77 For complete program listings www.cpac.ca 1-877-287-2722 Public iHan MnMony Csnsdsi csbk companies DOUG CAMILLI Show-biz gossip, and more, with a real point of view.

I'm headed back to the negotiating table right now with that aim. Environmental groups that are lobbying delegations and observing discussions disavowed the attack. ""We believe there are more constructive ways to achieve our goals of preventing dangerous climate change,"" several groups said in a letter. If ratified, the Kyoto Protocol would commit industrialized nations to reduce their combined greenhouse-gas releases by 2012 to a level at least 5 percent below emissions in 1990. Earlier yesterday, negotiators said some progress had been made on several important sticking points, including the roles of nuclear power and the situation in Russia, where emissions have plunged because of economic decline. Nuclear power has been a pivotal issue for the European Union and many environmentalists, which have pressed to have it excluded from a list of technologies that rich lands could export to poor countries to help them avoid future emissions of carbon dioxide. Canada, China and the United States oppose such a ban. And France, despite its outward opposition, relies heavily on nuclear plants for its electricity. Last night, it appeared that language was evolving that would give strong preference under the treaty to less controversial non-polluting options like wind turbines, but would not explicitly banish nuclear plants.

ROCH CARRIER MONDAY MORNING Catching the sun Baking bodies nicer sight than ice-covered sidewalks - Montreal sidewalks may be covered with ice but, here on a Jamaican beach, the sand is like amber. The dormant sea is as beautiful as eternity. I should be in ecstasy. Instead, I throb with a hundred distractions. In rows, like cookies in an oven, bodies are being baked under the sun. They are all sizes, all shapes. On some beach chairs, excess flesh spills over like corn from an overfilled popper. I'm not wearing my glasses, but I seem to have no vision problems when the baking body before me is that of a lady who has removed the top part of her bikini. If the lady notices my glance, I pump out my chest, pull in my belly and swear to myself that, when I'm back in Montreal, I will enroll in a health club. I cannot help thinking too that, not long ago, our Christian ancestors did not shrink from using the whip to teach the natives that they should wear clothes. Tourism is a new way of colonizing islands and here we are, naked, showing what was so offensive to our ancestors when the natives were showing it. Now, perhaps, we are offending the natives? So we walk on the beach. It's not easy. There are 10 hustlers for every tourist. My friend, do you want to buy a delicious coconut? Do you want fresh peanuts? Does your friend want to have braids made? Do you want to buy a carved pissing man? Would you like some freshly cooked lobsters? What about a tour on a glass-bottomed boat? You're invited to our restaurant, which is the best. Come with us scuba diving. Would you prefer snorkeling? Why don't you try parasailing over the calm water of Negril? Oh! You don't like the ocean: what about horseback riding? Nothing? So you don't like Jamaica. Everyone suntans, nobody swims. Painful as it is, I prefer the abuse to scraping the ice off my car windshield at six in the morning. So to thwart the hustlers, we edge into the ocean. The water is clear and clean. Nobody is bathing. Tourists are busy at their suntanning. On a seven-day trip, they want their skin to be dark enough to show back at their offices that they were intelligent enough to escape frozen Montreal. Is it not true that winter is a bizarre invention? Was it divinely created? Is it written in the Bible that God created winter? On which day of the week did he do that to us? I will check; there is a Gideon's Bible in my night-table drawer. ""Everything cool, mon?"" A tall young man stands idle in the water up to his chin. If there were no sun, his smile would light the whole bay. His long hair is divided into thin ringlets. That hairstyle shows his religious leanings. According to Rastafarianism, a popular cult on the island, the messiah was Haile Selassie, the late king of Ethiopia, the King of Kings, the Lion of Judah. Many young Jamaicans identify themselves with the lion. They turn their hair into a mane; they imitate the lion's imperial way of walking. ""Are you from England, mon?"" Do I look like an Englishman? If my Roman Catholic French-Canadian mother hears about this, she will rush to confession. ""I'm from Canada,"" I said. ""Oh it's cold rass in Canada! It's all ice,"" the hairy young man explains. ""There is no water like this, it's all ice."" What is he trying to sell me? The young man makes his smile still wider. The light on his teeth is still more brilliant. Heading for Canada ""Today is my last day in Jamaica,"" he announces. ""I'm spending all my time in the ocean, right here there is a bunch of white fishes around me! I don't know what they want. They stick to me. And there is a lazy ray sleeping on the sand. I stay on this spot all day. I came here this morning and I did not budge. I'm just enjoying myself. I'm waiting for my girl, Blossom. She cooks at the hotel. When she is finished, she'll come. We'll have a swim, will go right under this tree of life, right there, and we'll smoke ganja. After, we'll go to my cabin, behind the tree of life. Dat Blossom is pretty to rass. After, we'll smoke ganja and wait for the sunset. When night has come, we'll move where there is good reggae. We'll dance until the morning. Then I'll catch the bus to the airport."" ""Why do you go to the airport?"" ""I'm leaving tomorrow for Canada. My cousin makes roofs in Canada. He needs me to make more roofs. It's very cold in that country. They don't only have ice, they have snow."" ""Yes, it's cold. Don't forget to bring a woollen sweater."" ""Canada is cold for sure. I'll make roofs and I'll buy a car. They all drive big cars up there, but they drive on the wrong side of the road. I'll come back to Jamaica with my big car. I'll take Blossom for a ride. When she has had enough, I'll stop. Like tourists, we'll do some skinny-dipping. We'll lie down under a tree of life and we'll smoke ganja."" ""Good luck!"" I said.

Alert is not Canada's coldest weather station, but it is closest to the North Pole. Frozen CeiD JSBlrt MfSlllOil! Canada's remotest weather post is lonely, forbidding DAVID PHILLIPS SPECIAL TO THE GAZETTE ALERT As we Montrealers begin to mutter about what seems like another interminable winter, spare a thought for a small group of weather technicians locked in a cheerless wasteland above the Arctic Circle. While visions of spring or vacations in the sun seep into the dreams of many of us, isolation and mind-numbing cold are more likely in the minds of four intrepid observers at this tiny outpost 720 kilometres from the North Pole. This is Alert, N.T., home of the ""frozen chosen"" who gather weather data regardless of the season in the starkness of the world's most northerly permanent settlement. They are not alone in their dark melancholy at the top of the world. Canada maintains about 30 other stations north of the Arctic Circle; the United States also has some, as do the Soviet Union, Iceland, Finland and the Scandinavian countries. None, however, is perched as far north or as close to the Pole as Alert. The weather centre is part of Canadian Forces Station Alert, where 200 military personnel live and work. It is Canada's most classified military station, a listening post for radio signals from around the world. Alert in winter has the look of a space station, barren, remote, ringed with radio antennae, locked in the grip of unspeakable cold and cloaked in near-perpetual darkness. Named after survey ship, the post was built as part of a Canadian-American project. Other High Arctic stations had preceded it at Resolute and Eureka in 1947, and Isachsen and Mould Bay in 1948. Isachsen was closed in 1978. Alert was named after one of the ships of an 1875-76 expedition by Sir George Strong Nares to survey the north coast of Ellesmere Island. Before an airstrip was built, equipment and supplies for Alert had to be shipped by icebreaker or flown to the remote station from Thule in western Greenland, then dropped by parachute. During one airlift in 1950, an RCAF Lancaster crashed, killing all nine persons on board. A memorial cairn and nine crosses mark the gravesite overlooking the Arctic Ocean. CFS Alert was established in 1957, and a phased withdrawal of U.S. support from joint Arctic weather stations began in 1970. Clyde LeGuerrier, electronics technician for the Dept. of Transport, looks out over panorama at Cape Columbia near Alert. Alert is not Canada's coldest weather station. That distinction belongs to Eureka, 500 km to the southwest. Alert's average temperature is -18 Celsius. But never on record has the temperature risen above 20 C. There has never been a thaw in January, and the average frost-free season lasts only four days. The most memorable cold spell at Alert occurred in February 1979. Only once did the temperature climb above -40. Meteorological technician Andrew Smart remembers cheering on Feb. 9 when the thermometer registered -50, the lowest ever recorded at the station. (Colder temperatures have been recorded in Banff and Lake Louise.) Seasoned staff at Alert, though, are not unduly affected by periods of prolonged cold. For them, a jump from -40 to -20 can feel like the first warm day in spring. Long winter walks under a full moon are possible, with no worry of becoming lost since a person's trail is well marked by small clouds of ice crystals from his or her breath that hover at head level for some time afterward. Other outdoor activities are also possible when winds are low, although extra precautions must be taken to prevent throat and lung burn from overexertion in the frigid air. Spring is obviously welcome. After months of darkness in below-freezing temperatures, skies lighten, winds slacken and the air warms. Summer arrives slowly but doesn't last long. With continuous daylight, however, there is time for building, repairing, cleaning, and playing baseball and golf at any time of day or night. An exceptionally hot summer's day may bring double-digit temperatures, but occasional snow showers remind southerners where they really are. The High Arctic is one of the driest regions in the world, although moisture is plentiful in its lakes and rivers, in the muskeg and permafrost, in the snow cover, in the permanent ice and in the Arctic Sea. Snowfall is surprisingly light, averaging just 150 centimetres a year at Alert. Records show that there has never been a thunderstorm, and rainfall averages a paltry 18 millimetres a year. At Alert, periods of total dark or total daylight last about 21 weeks. On Feb. 28, the sun will make its first appearance on the southern horizon without question the most heralded occasion of an Arctic winter and the start of a celebration at the weather station that residents call the Sunrise Festival. In March, daylight increases by more than 15 minutes a day, with around-the-clock daylight beginning early in April. On Oct. 15, the sun disappears for the winter. Weather technicians at Alert, men and women in their 20s who are employees of Environment Canada, are posted for three to eight months and receive at least three weeks' leave. The daily work schedule consists of 10-hour shifts. Weather balloons are released every 12 hours. As well, there are weekly ice-thickness surveys, twice-monthly snow surveys and daily radiation measurements. A major new program began at Alert in August 1986, with the opening of the world's most northerly environmental monitoring laboratory. Alert is now one of 20 global air-pollution observatories measuring greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and Arctic haze. Unfortunately, even on a clear day, you can no longer see forever in the Arctic, primarily because of industrial pollution soot particles, heavy metals, and organic and acidic sulphates originating in Europe and the Soviet Union. The new lab helps scientists identify major routes of toxic substances in the Arctic. Recently, pesticides were found in snow on Ellesmere Island, in the air at Mould Bay, and in the internal organs of fish, seals, whales and polar bears. Why do the weather technicians come to this far end of the earth? For many, it is the money generally they work 55 hours a week which, when overtime is combined with isolation pay, can double their base salaries. Just the same, life is far from dull. The Arctic is no longer the dreaded, alien place of years gone by. Living at the top of the world is peaceful and silent, with most of the comforts of home provided. Other inducements include Arctic cuisine, no heat waves, few pests, the possibility of seeing Arctic wolves stalking muskox, dancing Arctic hares, first-rate star-gazing, and the chance to walk where few have ever gone. The weather observers are lodged with the National Defence staff in one of three large two-storey buildings. The barracks are arranged in wings connected by a central corridor to the main complex, which has a dining room, post office, movie theatre, darkroom, library, television and ham radio studios, three bars and a commissary. There is also a gymnasium, two-lane bowling alley and a curling rink to help pass the time. Bedrooms are comfortable single accommodations. Although weather observers at Alert are better off than their counterparts at most Arctic stations, thanks to weekly incoming flights bearing mail and fresh produce, direct contact with family and friends in the south is limited. Technicians are allowed only one 20-minute call home every eight to 10 days. Visitors, and pets, are not permitted. So spare a thought for them this winter as they maintain their icy, isolated vigil.

The Pittsburgh Penguins' centre is the NHL's only $2-million-dollar man well ahead of the $1,720,000 figure which appears on Wayne Gretzky's contract with the Los Angeles Kings. Lemieux also has an undisclosed amount of deferred compensation. Lemieux, Gretzky and Edmonton's Mark Messier are the only millionaires, even though the understanding was that Detroit's Steve Yzerman had joined that elite club when he signed a new contract during the off-season. Yzerman's contract calls for $700,000. Messier, who's a leading candidate for the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player this season, needs his $42,800 in deferred compensation to edge beyond the $1-million plateau. His basic salary, in Canadian funds, is $990,700. Yzerman's salary also is considerably less than Dave Taylor's contract with the Los Angeles Kings, which calls for $500,000 a season, plus $450,000 in deferred compensation. For now, at least, the NHLPA plans to release its salary lists next Monday. The Gazette obtained a copy. The figures are basic salaries. In other words, they represent the numbers contained in the contracts teams file with the league. Individual and team bonuses aren't included, but the numbers the NHL sees on contracts are what the players get. Under-the-table deals aren't permitted by the league. On the other hand, there are cases and Gretzky may be one where a player can sign another contract with a company controlled by the owner of a hockey team but divorced from the hockey operation. An example is the contract the Canadiens filed with the NHL for Larry Robinson last season. His basic salary was $350,000, but he also had a $100,000 contract for off-ice services with Molson brewery, the Canadiens' parent company. Robinson now is earning $550,000. AP Soviets urge total troop pullout by East, West JEFFREY SMITH WASHINGTON POST Romanians protest in front of Bucharest's Victoria Palace, the government seat, which is guarded by armed troops. 30,000 Romanians defy troops Protesters say governing front is trying to steal election MIKE TRICKEY SOUTHAM NEWS BUCHAREST Nearly 30,000 Romanians marched on Victory Square yesterday in the largest anti-government protest since the December revolution. Organized by the National Peasants and the National Liberals, who claim Ceause-scu-era Communists are trying to steal the people's victory, the slogan-chanting protesters called for the ruling National Salvation Front to resign. Undeterred by the cold or a ring of soldiers backed by tanks, the crowd broke through the barricade and descended on the Foreign Ministry building being used as government headquarters. President Ion Iliescu appeared on the building's balcony, but quickly went back inside when his pleas for national unity were shouted down by the throng. Fights broke out as demonstrators loyal to the front about 20 per cent of the crowd clashed with those opposing the government. However, there were no reports of serious injuries. Iliescu later said opposition parties met with his government and have agreed to broad talks. The opposition parties have demanded that the front resign and that a provisional government made up of representatives from the 18 opposition parties be established to lead the country to the May 20 election. Opposition to the front has grown steadily since last Tuesday when it announced it would take an active role in the election after indicating earlier that it would remain in power only until a new government could be elected. Vice-President Dumitru Masilu resigned from the front on Friday, saying ""Stalinist methods"" were still being used. And the country's most influential newspaper, Romania Libera, until last week a solid supporter of Iliescu, has been critical of the front, saying the government's actions are reminiscent of the regime of the executed Nicolae Ceausescu. In other developments in eastern Europe: Yugoslav police shot to death four ethnic Albanians yesterday, bringing to at least 14 the number killed in weekend political protests in the troubled southern province of Kosovo, witnesses said. The four were killed as police battled some 10,000 demonstrators in Suva Reka, 50 kilometres southwest of the regional capital of Pristina, town residents said. Bulgaria's opposition will not join the government before free elections are held because any reforms it backs could be blocked by the Communist-controlled parliament, said Georgi Spassov, spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces. Thousands of people jammed a church outside Prague yesterday to greet the first Catholic bishop to be consecrated since Czechoslovakia's revolution ousted the hard-line Communist leadership. Bishop Karel Otcenasek, 70, who spent 11 years in jail for carrying out his religious duties secretly in the 1950s, became residential bishop at Hradec Kralova. ADDITIONAL REPORTING: REUTER, AP VIENNA, Austria The Soviet Union is willing to withdraw all of its troops from Eastern Europe within five years if all United States and allied foreign troops are removed from Western Europe within the same period under an international agreement, a senior Soviet official says. The proposal by Oleg Grinevsky, Moscow's chief negotiator on conventional force reductions, goes further than any previous Soviet offer and would essentially scrap a major feature of his country's defence policy for the past 45 years. ""We are ready (for all Soviet troops) to leave Eastern Europe by 1995 in the second stage of the negotiations on reductions in conventional forces if NATO withdraws its troops stationed in Europe,"" Grinevsky said in an interview. His proposal is intended to bring the issue of troop cuts back to the East-West negotiating forum, which has been virtually eclipsed by calls from Hungarian, Czechoslovak and Polish leaders for a swifter and more extensive Soviet withdrawal than required in current NATO and Warsaw Pact proposals.

Xianda,235,"16-PAGE SPECIAL SECTION Looking back on days of freezing rain and chaos: the stories of people caught in the tempest MONTREAL SINCE 1778 SPORTS FINAL JANUARY 24, 1998 $1 Weather expert Pommainville is one of the lucky. Power was restored to his home on Tuesday afternoon, even before he left the office. His house is warm and bright. Some of his colleagues, by contrast, have turned into surprised refugees. Worried employees huddle for a smoke in the lobby of the St. Laurent building. They expected dramatic weather. But they never anticipated weather powerful enough to snap Hydro pylons like chicken bones. The meteorologists are scrambling to keep up with the demand. As well as their regular forecasts to the general public, the media and the region's airports, they are now providing special forecasts to Hydro-Quebec. They also begin to make regular calls to the premier's office. By 11:17 a.m., the outlook has changed. It now seems clear that Wednesday will bring relatively little freezing rain to southern Quebec. Still, the new bulletin warns: A more important system will affect most regions tonight and Thursday. It will give important additional quantities of freezing rain. Bombardier Eric Steinkey brushes up. THE ICE STORM OF '98 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY Rene Ivesque Blvd, near Bleury St, on ties of freezing rain. Like Cassandra in the Trojan War, the weather forecasters can predict the ravaging future. But they're powerless to change it. Hydro launches a massive de-icing and repair operation of its distribution network. More than 770 crews, including those from private companies, are sent out to remove branches from lines and to chip ice away from wooden electricity poles that are still standing. The work proves frustrating to many linemen: ice-glazed branches continue falling on lines that have just been repaired. ""It's going to take a lot more than 24 hours to fix this,"" Millette says. ""We need additional manpower."" Millette calls Ontario Hydro, but that utility has run into the same problems in the Ottawa region and can't afford to send linemen to Quebec. He tries utilities south of the border and manages to recruit some crews. On Montreal Island, the number of disrupted lines has dropped to 100.

Canceling flights can lead to penalties TRAVELING RIGHTS PAUL UNTERBERG Many airlines, even charter airlines, are being pretty lenient with Quebecers who had to cancel or change their travel plans because they were too busy chipping ice off their cold, dark homes to catch the plane. Most are letting their passengers re-book without penalty, but the chaos of the last couple of weeks makes this a good time to review what your rights as a traveler are, as opposed to what the airlines are willing to do for you as a goodwill gesture. To know who is entitled to what, we must first examine the kind of contract and the type of product. A full-fare airline ticket on a regularly scheduled carrier is almost always fully reimbursable. APEX tickets or any other reduced fare tickets might have a cancellation or change-of-date penalty, but it's usually not very much. SEVERE RESTRICTIONS Charter flights and packages are very different. In exchange for a lower price, severe restrictions apply. These may, in cancellation cases, equal the total purchase price. Such severe penalties are valid on the condition that the traveler was made aware of them when he bought the ticket or package. These penalties are applicable against the traveler even though he has the world's best reasons for canceling - a death in the family, job loss, freezing rain and an icy home or other acts of God. Those who were prudent enough to have bought cancellation insurance will be happy to know that many (but not all) such policies have a clause allowing cancellation and the collection of a refund if the insured's principal residence becomes uninhabitable. Read your policy carefully and if necessary call your insurance agent for info. Don't forget that there may be delays you have to respect. VACATIONS CUT SHORT What about people, happy in the sunny south, who had to cut short their vacations because their home in the ""black triangle"" is without heat and light? The same principles apply. Package contracts have a clause stating that unused portions are not reimbursable. Such clauses are valid. Often cancellation-insurance policies have a clause covering trip interruption for things like the principal residence becoming uninhabitable. This might cover return airline tickets and perhaps even reimbursement of the unused portion of the package. Read your policy carefully. When you buy a package or a cheap ticket, you have to keep in mind that any cancellation penalties mentioned in the contract are legal and valid regardless of the reasons for canceling. That's why cancellation insurance is so useful. Such policies don't cover everything, but they often help.

Mount Royal was still off-limits yesterday as tree-pruners sawed off dangling branches in the midst of a snowstorm. The parking lot near the chalet and small refuges or other places where animals might be suffering. This is not the SPCA, Bercovici said. She is just an incredible lady who loves animals. More help is on the way. The mission is sending bunk beds to house volunteers. And a foundation that helps poor people is trying to start a government program to pay welfare recipients to work at the refuge. The area was filled with thousands of branches, stacked in piles as high as 10 feet. The Parks Department estimates that about 160,000 trees were damaged by the ice storm this month. At least 2,000 were destroyed. Those figures don't include the damage to wooded areas. In the next three months, city crews plan to carry out an exhaustive inventory of the damage in all parks and streets. In total, Montreal has about 445,000 trees in public spaces. City officials were unable to give the number of trees damaged on Mount Royal. But Peter Howlett, president of Les Amies de la Montagne, said that 75 per cent of the park's 200,000 trees suffered minor to severe damage. About 35 per cent of them, or 70,000, were destroyed, he estimated. Freezing rain had coated branches with ice up to 2 inches thick, causing them to snap. The trunks of some trees even split in two. ""It's light-years beyond any stress, any damage, any experience that natural areas such as this have ever been exposed to in our lifetimes,"" he said. ""It is only obvious to realize that it is completely beyond the responsibility of the city services alone to take care of this. The community has to step up. It's going to take a lot of collaboration from the public to make this work."" OTTAWA - The city of Ottawa will look for ways to replace or restore thousands of trees damaged by this month's ice storm. ""One of my duties is to protect and preserve Ottawa's natural legacy,"" Mayor Jim Watson said yesterday. ""The ice storm has put that legacy at risk and steps must be taken immediately to ensure that future generations will know a green and healthy Ottawa."" Watson announced the creation of the Atkinson Fellowship in Public Policy, now entering its eleventh year, is an award designed to further the tradition of liberal journalism and commitment to social and economic justice fostered by Joseph E. Atkinson, former publisher of The Toronto Star. It will be awarded to a full-time journalist for a one-year research project on a topical public policy issue, culminating in the publication of results in a series of articles, which the journalist is then free to develop into a book. The Fellowship includes a stipend of $65,000. As well, a budget for research expenses up to $25,000 is also available. The research year begins September 1, 1998. Application forms will be available January 17. The closing date for entries is March 13, 1998. Sponsored by The Atkinson Charitable Foundation, The Toronto Star and the Beland Honderich Family.

To that end, Les Amies will launch a fundraising drive next week to restore Mount Royal's flora, Howlett said. The group also plans to organize a cleanup after the park is reopened. The city hopes to reopen sections of Mount Royal - Beaver Lake, the Belvedere along Camillien Houde Way and the chalet - by next Saturday. Among the districts that were hardest hit are St. Henri, Point St. Charles and Ville Emard (94 per cent of the trees were damaged); Notre Dame de Grace and Cote des Neiges (89 per cent); and Rosemont and Petite-Patrie (77 per cent). COST UNKNOWN Claude Jean Lapointe, commissioner of the Scouts du Montreal Metropolitain, said his troops will continue volunteering after the Angrignon Park cleanup. ""It's all part of our values; games, teamwork and nature,"" Lapointe said. ""During the ice storms, some of the older Scouts helped out at some seniors' residences. After the freezing rain, we have to concentrate on the cleanup and we will be involved until it's all over,"" Bourque said he doesn't know what it will cost to repair and replant the trees, but Quebec will foot part of the bill under its disaster-relief program. A task force of environmental and community representatives to look at the options available to replace and maintain the city's trees. A preliminary survey indicates that 45,000 of the city's 60,000 on-street trees suffered significant damage. It is estimated that 6,000 of those trees will have to be cut down because of the severe damage they suffered. It could cost millions to replace those trees, the city said in a statement as it announced a fundraising campaign to help pay for tree replanting. All hell is breaking loose Tuesday, Jan. 6: The route demands phoning the utility's hotline on the second floor. The fire department is also calling, asking Hydro to repair distribution lines that have snapped under the weight of freezing ice and fallen branches. The electricity has stopped flowing in more than one-quarter of the 840 distribution lines that crisscross the island. Entire neighborhoods are plunged into darkness. ""This is bad,"" distribution operator Simard says to one of his two co-workers. ""We've got to call in more staff."" The situation is far worse on the South Shore. More than 124,000 households have lost their power by 2:30 a.m. Most of the homes are located in what is later dubbed the ""triangle of darkness"" - a sprawling area bounded by Saint-Hyacinthe to the north, Granby to the east and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu to the south. Medium-voltage transmission lines that supply that area with electricity have toppled. Andre Martineau is jolted out of bed when the phone rings. It's the overnight foreman at Hydro-Quebec. He's to report to work. Now, all hell is breaking loose. Freezing rain is still pounding on the windows of his Laval West bungalow as he dresses. It's pitch black, the street lights are out in places and the roads to the west sector's offices on Henri Bourassa Blvd are a sheet of ice. The morning shift isn't scheduled to start until 7 a.m., but there are dozens of teams already at their trucks when Martineau, 38, gets in. Others are still awaiting work orders. There are power outages all over the place. Wires down everywhere. Where to start? Fellow lineman Bernard Dagenais doesn't stumble in until after 8 a.m. He'd gotten a middle-of-the-night call, too. But he's been off on Christmas holidays and this is no way to get back in the groove. So the 17-year Hydro veteran rolled over and went back to sleep. But there's no avoiding this ice storm. It hits him like a ton of bricks. Schools across the island have canceled classes. His daughters, 6 and 8 years old, are romping around the house, celebrating. Ice and snow blanket the trees on Mount Royal around the Women's Pavilion of the Royal Victoria Hospital on THE ICE STORM OF '98. His wife books off work. By midday, Dagenais has climbed a dozen trees and dragged hundreds of ice-laden branches and downed wires from the middle of streets across Hampstead, LaSalle and Pointe Claire. It's gray and gloomy and the freezing rain still hasn't let up. He's getting pretty dexterous with the chainsaw. But it's impossible to keep dry, even with the big raincoat he wears over his Hydro Quebec parka. Behind the wheel of his Mazda, Millette glimpses signs of the devastation: ice-laden branches crashing to the ground, high-voltage transmission towers buckling under the weight of thick ice and loose wires dangling in the wind. In Montreal, Millette alerts Quebec's civil-protection authorities. ""We have to mobilize our resources,"" he says over the phone. ""We don't know how long the freezing rain is going to last."" THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY JANUARY 24, 1998. On the 16th floor of a downtown office tower, Millette and his team work the phones all day long, dispatching linemen from across Quebec to the stricken areas. But the number of blacked-out homes and businesses keeps rising. The forecast was right, but Pommainville's home in Laval is still bright and warm when he leaves for work under a starless sky. His children can sleep late; their classes have been canceled. Soon after the scientist reaches the office, his house goes dark. The atmosphere in the Environment Canada office is tense. Pommainville and his colleagues sense that an exceptional weather event is underway. But the more unusual the event, the greater the pressure to come up with an accurate forecast. Their work, as a result, is not only scientific; it's also linguistic. If their words seem exaggerated, the forecasters will be criticized. But if the words appear to minimize a problem, the forecasters will come under equal attack. On the fifth floor of Montreal Urban Community police headquarters on Bonsecours St, in Old Montreal, about a dozen police officers file into a warehouse-like room filled with computers, electronic monitors and banks of telephones. The group consists of representatives of the MUCPD's planning, logistics and emergency-measures departments. Telephone hook-ups have been established with Hydro-Quebec and local fire departments. Two hours earlier, Hydro-Quebec had warned that its power-distribution system in Montreal - as well as that serving southwestern Quebec - was in imminent danger of collapse in a freezing rain storm. Reports are already coming in from two dozen precincts on the western side of Montreal Island that power has been lost and whatever traffic hasn't skidded off the road is beginning to tangle. But the police high command is hearing a different story from its precincts in the east end. Power is being maintained, and while the roads are slick, no one is hitting the panic button. One senior officer will later recall that the gist of the message sent from the east side of St. Laurent is that ""this is not the first time we've had freezing rain."" The downtown core remains lit. The media are concentrating on the devastation wrought by the freezing rain on the South Shore, but Montreal, while battered, has not broken down. The operations centre monitors the situation until midnight, then closes. By now, more than 800,000 Hydro customers in the Monteregie, Laurentians and Montreal Island are without power. Near Drummondville, a high-voltage line collapses, blocking Highway 20. The weather bulletin this evening tries to give a ray of hope: ""The south of Quebec will experience a respite Wednesday, Jan. 7, this evening and tonight, as very little freezing rain is predicted."" But, the bulletin continues, ""Another disturbance coming from the Great Lakes will give the south of Quebec more sustained freezing rain on Wednesday."" A day earlier, 9 millimeters of freezing rain had fallen on Montreal - more than the usual amount for the whole of January. Today, the total will be 15.6. Tree branches are starting to buckle. People are starting to flee their homes. In the evening, when he leaves the parking lot outside his office, forecaster Pommainville has to scrape a thick layer of ice off his car. DAY 3 WEDNESDAY, JAN. 7 GAZETTE: Ice cripples region LAPRESSE: 760,000 foyers sont privés d'électricité JOURNAL DE MONTREAL: 2 millions de Québécois privés de courant LE DEVOIR: La ville figée dans le cristal. More freezing rain, with heavier winds this time, knocks out a major Hydro substation in Saint-Hyacinthe, making a bad situation worse. It doubles, to 500,000, the number of South Shore Hydro customers (businesses and households) without power, along with 130,000 on the island of Montreal and 70,000 in the Laurentians and Outaouais. As Hydro repeats that it might take days to restore power, Continued on Page 5 DAVE SIDAWAY, GAZETTE DAY 4 THURSDAY, JAN. 8 GAZETTE: Here comes Round 2 LAPRESSE: Encore du verglas LE JOURNAL: Un courant de solidarité LE DEVOIR: La météo fait craindre le pire. The precipitation ends, but not before dumping another load of freezing rain over parts of southwestern Quebec, creating even more havoc. As the crisis deepens, Premier Bouchard accepts an offer from the Canadian government to send in the army. The first 2,500 soldiers arrive at night from CFB Valcartier near Quebec City. They are joined by more than 800 tree-trim and line-repair workers from the northeastern U.S. It warns, ""will give many types of precipitation to the above regions into the night, and again on Friday."" In the Montreal region, a mixture of freezing rain and ice pellets will persist until tonight and will resume on Friday after a brief period of calm. The forecast would prove correct, up to a point. Even so, it seems clear in retrospect that Thursday is the day when Montreal dodges a bullet. Over a 24-hour period, Montreal receives only 2.8 mm of freezing rain. In Ottawa, by contrast, the total is 19.6; in Saint-Hubert, 22.7. These totals are preliminary. Among the minor effects of the freezing rain is its ability to clog the sensors of the meteorologists' machines. MORNING The temperature in the Goral home has dropped like a stone overnight. THE ICE STORM OF '98. They get Marilyn Monroe, we get Mother Nature. Weaker wood pylons are only temporary. HYDRO Continued from Page 1. There were 6 kilometers of line left to connect before the Saint-Césaire substation can be restarted, said Hydro spokesman Jean-Claude Lefebvre. Saint-Césaire's intricate network of wires, pylons and transformers act as power brokers, breaking down the electricity that snakes into Saint-Césaire along 230-kilovolt lines from a Boucherville station into the more manageable voltage of 120 kv. The 120-kv lines from Saint-Césaire then supply the neighborhood. Saint-Césaire is dually important, Cliche said, because while it provides electricity straight to the Saint-Césaire area, it also sends 230-kv lines out into wide swaths of the Monteregie, to be further broken down and then shipped to neighborhood transformers. While freezing rain in the first days of the storm took a toll on lines leaving Saint-Césaire, Cliche said, the real catastrophe for Saint-Césaire came with the last dump of ice, which came Jan. 9. The final day of the ice storm killed Saint-Césaire's power supply, which comes down from Manicouagan along 735-kv wires before passing through the Boucherville station, where its voltage is stepped down to 230 kv. Under normal circumstances, the work of repairing the lines from Boucherville down through the Monteregie and across the Richelieu River to Saint-Césaire would take between three and four months, Cliche said. To complete the task in under three weeks, Hydro has had to do more than just import skilled help from south of the border. Wooden rather than metal pylons are being used to hold up the lines because they are faster to build. ""Normally, this would not conform with Hydro standards,"" Cliche said. ""Right now, we will use wood, and then later we will replace them."" Compromising standards also means compromising reliability, Cliche admitted readily. ""What will the performance be? We can't assure people it will be 100 per cent."" ""Thunder is an enemy, wind is an enemy. Today we have wind,"" Yvan Cliche said. The odds of major blackouts because of the new system's relative flimsiness ""can be reduced if people reduce their consumption of power,"" he said. Mild weather would also help, he said. ""It's like a hockey player with an injury - you send him back out there and you see if he can stand it."" For now, reconnecting the lines is like sewing, but with heavy wires rather than thread. The linemen are slowly pulling the wire through the pylons - some newly constructed out of wood to replace fallen metal ones - to link Boucherville and Saint-Césaire. Atop the last pylon, across the road from the station, two linemen spent hours in the blizzard yesterday getting connections ready for the final pull. The wires feeding into the last pylon are hooked to a pulley system, which is controlled by a tractor on the ground. When it's time, the tractor will pull the whole Boucherville-Saint-Césaire connection taut, and ""juice,"" as the Hydro workers call it, will return to the triangle of darkness. It won't happen all at once, Cliche cautioned. Power will be reclaimed by Saint-Césaire's control center very slowly to make sure the equipment, which has been frozen and out of use for two weeks, can handle the flow. It will also be phased into the distribution system to avoid trying to warm up tens of thousands of freezing households all at once - a sure way to get another good power failure going, Cliche said. Even once the power is on full blast, between 60,000 and 70,000 Quebecers will probably still be in the cold because their distribution network is damaged, Hydro cautioned this week. But with the energy flowing, Hydro will have an easier time pinpointing local problems and fixing them, according to spokesmen. While Saint-Césaire was still waiting for juice yesterday, the station itself was ready to go, chief Leo Quenneville said. It wasn't badly damaged by the ice, and workers were just fine-tuning operations yesterday. Hopefully, they'll get around to the light bulb in the downstairs station bathroom; it seems to be out. IRWIN BLOCK OF THE GAZETTE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS REPORT Clinton plans public response TAPE Continued from Page 1. Lewinsky's deposition scheduled for today before lawyers in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment civil suit against Clinton, 52, was postponed indefinitely. Lewinsky's lawyer suggested she is in no condition to be making public appearances or precipitous choices on her legal options. ""She is devastated, concerned, upset and fearful,"" said Ginsburg, adding that Lewinsky was in hiding with her mother. ""She does not know what the future holds."" Lewinsky's options are constrained by a signed affidavit stating she did not have a sexual relationship with Clinton. Starr, a special prosecutor, is also restricting her choices by threatening to indict her if she does not cooperate with his investigation of Clinton. If Lewinsky stands by her affidavit, then she would also be admitting to inventing her allegations of an affair with Clinton, allegations captured in secretly recorded audiotapes of conversations with her co-worker Linda Tripp. Lewinsky's options include showing up for a deposition in the Jones sexual-harassment suit and using the Fifth Amendment to refuse to testify on the grounds that her answers may be self-incriminating. She could also choose to testify as a prosecution witness before a grand jury, but that would only happen if she is granted immunity from prosecution, her lawyer said. That could be lethal to Clinton's presidency, but any testimony would be vulnerable to attack by the president's lawyers. Transcripts of taped conversations posted on a Newsweek magazine website suggest Lewinsky cast doubt on her own credibility. ""I have lied my entire life,"" she is reported to have told Tripp, according to the transcript. A Los Angeles Times source who listened to some of the tapes yesterday told the newspaper that Lewinsky said Clinton frequently telephoned her at home late at night, engaged in telephone sex with her and eventually devastated her emotionally by becoming involved with several other women. The source said Lewinsky is heard saying that she engaged only in oral sex with the president, and that Clinton told her he did not consider such an act to constitute a sexual affair. Yesterday, Clinton's press secretary, Mike McCurry, said the president feels empathy for Lewinsky and hopes to publicly explain his relationship with her before his State of the Union address Tuesday night. McCurry said presidential lawyers and aides are working to assemble the information that Clinton needs to explain his relationship with the San Francisco native and to answer any follow-up questions that might arise. McCurry said Clinton would ""be better off"" if he could address the nation prior to the State of the Union address and a trip the next day to Illinois and Wisconsin. White House officials said Clinton is weighing a variety of nationally televised formats to try to clear the air. THE POWER CRISIS THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 24, 1998 Quebec offers business-loan program KATHERINI WILTON The Gazette Finance Minister Bernard Landry expects about 3,000 business owners to apply for government-backed loans to help companies recover from financial losses during the ice storm. Landry said yesterday the government will guarantee loans of $50,000 to $500,000 for companies that were without power as of Jan. 12. Business owners must first apply for a loan from a bank. If it is approved, a government agency will guarantee 80 per cent of a loan up to $50,000 for small businesses, and 70 per cent of loans from $50,000 to $500,000 for manufacturing firms. All loans must be repaid within three years. To qualify, businesses must have been profitable before the storm and must have closed as of Jan. 12 because of a power failure or because of a Hydro-Quebec restriction on opening. Business owners have until April 30 to apply for the loan guarantee. ""This measure is necessary because thousands of businesses lost money during the ice storm, especially in the hardest-hit areas,"" Landry said. ""Some of them need a financial boost to get over their losses."" The loans will be guaranteed by the Société de Développement Industriel du Québec. The agency will set up temporary offices in the hardest-hit areas to handle the program. A study this week of 500 businesses in the Monteregie revealed that 75 per cent of industrial firms were operating, but not at capacity. About 80 per cent of firms that still have not reopened lack sufficient personnel or financing, or have been penalized because of late deliveries. Landry said the SDI will also provide consultants who will help business owners renegotiate lost contracts with clients and provide other technical assistance. For more information about the loans, call the SDI's office in Montreal at 873-4375. MORE TROUBLE Snow blamed for 4 deaths IRWIN BLOCK The Gazette Four people died in traffic accidents yesterday as a storm dumped 22 centimeters of snow on southwestern Quebec, making driving treacherous. The snow also caused numerous fender-benders, tied up traffic in the Montreal area and slowed Hydro-Quebec's efforts to restore its delivery and distribution network. At the storm's height in the afternoon, two women were crushed when the driver of their car lost control near Sainte-Angelique, about 50 kilometers east of Hull, and swerved into the path of a semi-trailer, the Sûreté du Québec reported. At Sainte-Rosalie, near Saint-Hyacinthe, a van was hit by a truck and the van driver was killed. Near Saint-Nicephore, south of Drummondville, a 55-year-old woman died when her car collided with a truck. Six people were slightly injured in a 30-vehicle pileup on Highway 40 east of Repentigny. In Montreal, about 500 plows and graders were out last night, pushing the snow to curbside. ""We will decide tomorrow on when our snow-removal operation will begin,"" said Pierre Bonin, spokesman for the public-works department. Around the city, there was a rash of small accidents. In some areas, such as on Sherbrooke St, near Girouard St, traffic came to a virtual standstill because of stalled cars, police said. The storm dumped almost 19 centimeters at Mirabel, 22 at Saint-Hubert and 14 at Dorval, Environment Canada meteorologist Chantal Matthieu said. A narrow icing cover of freezing snow was expected overnight. Temperatures were rising overnight and should reach the zero mark today, then drop again tonight to between minus-10 to minus-12C.

The precipitation associated with this system will begin in the form of rain mixed with ice pellets, which will eventually change into freezing rain. The message goes out to the usual clients: radio and TV stations, airports, police. Gosselin glances up at one of the maps of Quebec that adorn the walls of the big, open-plan office. Soon, people all over the province will wake up to the forecast of what the heavens have in store for them. But no one - not even Gosselin - has any idea how catastrophic that low-pressure system will prove to be. DAY 1 MONDAY, JAN. 5 DAY 1 of the Great Ice Storm of '98 - and the first day back at work from the holidays for hundreds of thousands of workers in southwestern Quebec. It begins innocently enough - with freezing rain and the predictable morning traffic chaos. ""A nightmare,"" says one radio traffic reporter. But the real nightmare is only beginning. Road crews are out all day salting and sanding, and the streets and sidewalks of the city of Montreal look like mashed potatoes. The city never cleared away the snow that fell during the Dec. 30 snowstorm. Tuesday, Jan. 6: Notre Dame de Grace's Hingston Ave. Isabelle Guibert of Outremont is framed by ice-covered branches as she and the freezing rain has begun to form a layer of ice on city sidewalks and poorly plowed side streets. Pierre Bonin, an official with the city of Montreal, says mild temperatures are forecast for Montreal this week. ""But if conditions deteriorate, and we get more snow in the next few days, then we'll probably begin a snow-clearing operation,"" he says. Famous last words. ""We're in a state of alert. There are some blackouts and we have to follow things carefully,"" Pierre Millette, director of emergency plans for power failures said. The highway down from Laval is crammed during a wet, slippery rush hour, but Pierre Pommainville pulls into the St. Laurent weather office by 7:30 a.m. His three children are on their way to the first of five days of school. At the young age of 37, Pommainville is the shift supervisor among all the meteorologists in the office. That means he's in charge of a team of scientists, most of them casually dressed, all but one of them men. With his big glasses, eager manner and thinning hair, Pommainville looks the part; he'd be only slightly out of place in Flubber. Sipping a coffee, he glances at the morning's papers. A front-page headline in La Presse announces: ""Ça va aller mal!"" But the article has nothing to do with the miserable weather; it describes the fears of Quebecers for 1998. Now he studies the information in his computer. The data swirl there like a windblown cloud: air movement, temperature, humidity, pressure, fronts, precipitation. To a layman, the patterns would be hard to decipher. Fielding Ave. is blocked by fallen trees. On Tuesday, Pommainville understands their meaning. He doesn't like what he sees. A high band of warm, wet air is moving northward from the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, northeast winds have sent a mass of cold, dry air down the St. Lawrence Valley. Montreal looks fated to be the prime battleground between these two streams of air. The latest bulletin had gone out at 3:47 a.m., just as the battle commenced. ""The precipitation,"" it announced, ""has begun in the form of snow mixed with ice pellets, and is rapidly changing into freezing rain. This zone of freezing rain is already affecting the Outaouais and the Montreal region. Over the morning, it will spread to the Eastern Townships, the Beauce and the centre of Quebec. The freezing rain will become intermittent in the afternoon."" It's the conjunction of two distinct air masses - a higher, wet one and a lower, dry one - that serves as the catalyst for freezing rain. The moisture starts as snow in the highest clouds, melts into rain as it falls, but then solidifies in the final stretch down. Complicated, but not in itself abnormal: freezing rain affects Montreal a few times in most years. What concerns Pommainville is that such a conjunction usually has a short life span: one air mass or the other tends to get blown away. This time, however, the opposed weather systems look like they're settling in to stay. In the afternoon, Pommainville and his staff issue a new weather alert. It warns that although the freezing rain, ice pellets and snow may be weak this evening, they're expected to intensify overnight and Tuesday. JOHN MAHONEY, GAZETTE Jan. 6, South Shore. In Chateauguay, freezing rain topples a power line, cutting off electricity to 2,000 households. At 9 p.m., Millette calls Rejean Le-vasseur, Hydro's coordinator of maintenance crews. ""We're in a state of alert,"" Millette tells Levasseur. ""There are some blackouts and we have to follow things carefully."" Across the St. Lawrence River, near Jarry Park, Marcel Simard is working the night shift at Hydro's nerve centre for Montreal Island. Simard, a distribution operator, is monitoring computer screens that give him updates, every five seconds, of the power grid. DAY 2 JAN. 6 GAZETTE: More weather mess on the way LA PRESSE: Encore plus de verglas LE JOURNAL: Un temps de chien. By sunrise, large pockets of southwestern Quebec, the Outaouais region and eastern Ontario are without power as the freezing rain has turned into an escalating ice storm, downing thousands of tree branches and hydro lines. Every school board in and around Montreal closes. In Papineauville, east of Hull, the ice storm claims its first victim: 82-year-old Rolland Parent succumbs to carbon-monoxide poisoning while running a gas generator in the basement of his home. The storm drops almost 25 millimeters of freezing rain on Montreal, and is already being called the region's worst ice storm since 1961. Cities and towns start opening recreation centres and other public buildings as shelters. Vacationing in China, Montreal Mayor Pierre Bourque decides to return home at once. Chaos reigns at Dorval airport. On the Metropolitan Expressway, heavy road salting creates flood-like conditions, with cars axle-deep in water. ""It's going to be long, it's going to be hard, and it's going to take several days,"" Hydro-Quebec's Steve Illigann warns in an ominous warning about the power outages. I went way out on a limb - this must have been last fall when leaning on branches wasn't nearly as dangerous - and said we were going to have winter again this year. However, nowhere in their brazen call for a big snowstorm to bring in the new year did they say anything about freezing rain. So before you start stockpiling camp stoves and thermal sleeping bags for Armageddon on St. Patrick's Day, remember: they could have been guessing. There's only one way we're going to make it to May and that's by accentuating the positive.

The Red Cross is not interested in transferring its blood-related assets to the Quebec government and would not consider a proposal to open negotiations on the matter, a Red Cross spokesman said yesterday. We support an integrated national system, said Dennis Orchard, acting national director of public affairs for the humanitarian agency. We've looked at the Quebec alternative and rejected it. Experts say it would be difficult and costly for the Quebec government to set up a new blood system from scratch. A spokesman for Quebec Health Minister Jean Rochon expressed surprise and disbelief when told of Orchard's comments. What I am told is that the door to the Red Cross, concerning the personnel and assets of the Red Cross, that the door is still open, and that the option is still open, said France Amyot. The Red Cross has given no indication that it would not be open to discuss assets and personnel. But Orchard said it would not make sense to maintain a blood system for one province only, given the complexity of the apparatus and expertise. It would not make sense, period. He said the Red Cross's position on the issue was reinforced by the Krever report on the country's blood system, which said services should be managed by a single national entity. A federal-provincial-territorial committee - including representatives of all provinces but Quebec - is currently negotiating with the Red Cross to acquire blood-related assets worth several hundred million dollars. The committee also plans to transfer some 2,100 employees to the new Canadian Blood Services, the agency which will replace the Red Cross as operator of the national blood system. Last summer, after the other provinces announced plans to set up a new national blood agency, Rochon said he would prefer to retain Red Cross services in Quebec. When the Red Cross rejected that option in December, Rochon expressed interest in the creation of a separate Quebec blood agency using the existing staff and assets of the Red Cross in Quebec. The latest comments from the Red Cross appear to squelch that option. Michel Amar, spokesman for the Canadian Blood Service Transition Bureau, said Quebec would be welcome in the national agency. It would certainly make things a lot easier in terms of managing supply, he said. If you have a national blood system where there's a single national license, it's a lot less of a regulatory burden than having to regulate two separate systems. Amar said Quebec would face significant administrative problems trying to create a separate system from the ground up. Amyot said Quebec is still considering several options, including joining the national agency, and will not make a decision before the next meeting of health ministers. Court strikes down tough joyrider law Toronto Star NEWMARKET, Ont. - A tough new law aimed at making it easier to convict joyriders was declared unconstitutional Monday when a judge acquitted a 17-year-old. In a strongly worded ruling, Ontario Court Judge Sherrill Rogers said the law punishes people merely for being present during a crime and therefore violates a citizen's rights. The federal law, proclaimed last June, was designed to make it easier to convict young passengers who go for a spin with someone who has taken a car, often belonging to a parent, without consent. It allowed them to be convicted and jailed for up to six months, for no other reason than being present in the car. To make such a young person culpable in a criminal sense seems quite removed from the objective of curbing joyriding, Rogers said. Defence lawyer James Silver said Rogers's decision, thought to be the first to strike down the law, could influence but will not bind other judges in the country. Publication of the accused youth's name is banned under the Young Offenders Act. Rogers ruled that the law casts such a wide net that it could catch a young person who, seeking a quick way home, is offered a ride from school in a car that he or she later finds was taken without the owner's consent. The Crown has 30 days in which to file an appeal. THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 7, 1998 A3 THE BIG FREEZE PEGGY CURRAN: This ice is not? I nicel But Montrealers tough it out again Jan 5, 1643, Sieur de Maisonneuve planted a wooden cross atop Mount Royal to thank God after the colony narrowly escaped being destroyed by flooding. Three hundred and fifty-five years later, it looks like we're gonna need a bigger cross. The Storm of the Millennium is upon us. Better not put away your candles and battery chargers yet. So much for life getting back to normal after the holidays. Those of us who were lucky enough to make it through Day One without a power failure awoke yesterday to the sound of falling trees, crashing icicles, revving engines and whining windshield wipers. Hedges wilted, roofs strained and snowplows pushed away broken branches. Instead of packing the kids off to school, it was time to talk them out of playing in the slush. Those of us who absolutely had to go to work - or couldn't come up with a half-way believable excuse to stay home after two weeks' vacation - skidded on slippery highways or waded through the ice floes doing our best imitations of penguins in Sorel boots. Good thing the Rolling Stones aren't coming to the Olympic Stadium until next week, or the world's only octogenarian rock band might have fallen down and had to change their name to the Tragically Broken Hip. TAKES PRACTICE Montrealers weathered the fiercest ice storm in nearly 40 years with the aplomb that comes with generations of practice. When Mark Twain came to Montreal in 1881, he said that what we lacked in weather, we made up for in the means of grace. If grace means a mixture of prayer, fortitude and crazy endurance, we've got it by the shovelful. Whether we want to or not, real Montrealers carry a resilient winter gene. It doesn't matter how many years we've been away or how much we'd rather be in the sunny tropics, when the worst weather comes, we know what to do. Hoist that shovel. Lift that pail of rock salt. And never stick your tongue on a metal fence. However, Montrealers have different ways of putting this instinctive knowledge to use, of which several have been isolated and documented: The cozy-slipper syndrome (Montrealis fuzzy pantoufus): Copes with the rigours of winter by avoiding it. Books off sick at the first hint of a flurry. Pantry well-stocked with hot chocolate. Sometimes closes the blinds, plays old Don Ho albums and pretends to be in Waikiki. Knows that if he/she waits long enough, the snow/sleet will melt. Subscribes to extended cable service. The hot-dog syndrome (Montrealis stupidus extremis): Believes what's good for July is good for January. This social deviant makes no concessions to climate change when barreling down boulevards with one hand on the wheel and the other on the telephone. Honks at mothers with strollers and old people with canes who take too long crossing the street. Thinks nothing of parking in other people's driveways. The entrepreneur syndrome (Montrealis makeabuckus): Can't wait to get their power back. Meanwhile, they're sitting in the dark designing the I Survived T-shirts. NOTHING DAUNTED The hardy, persevere-against-all-odds strain (Montrealis undauntibus): When the going gets tough, the tough get shoveling. They would never let a little thing like a monster ice storm or fractured ribs keep them from going about their business. Typical is my friend Rita, who broke her wrist when she fell on the ice while delivering Meals on Wheels a few days before Christmas. She eventually went to the hospital - but only after she finished her rounds, washed the dishes, went bowling and had the rest of her bowling club over for holiday treats. She finally got her cast at 5 a.m., in time to drive an elderly distant relative to her appointment at the hairdresser. Truly, there's nothing like a cold-climate catastrophe to test our sense of community, whether that means helping the folks next door lift a tree off their car, giving strangers tips on how to ford the big pond without getting drenched or brewing coffee and organizing slumber parties for relatives without electricity. This is two parts good will, one part self-preservation. No one wants to be remembered as the guy who refused to push when the neighbour's car got stuck in an ice bank. And they will remember, until the next big one. Peggy Curran's E-mail address is pcurrandathegazette.southam.ca Ice ties up roads and airport - One of the worst storms I've lived through SUSAN SEMENAK The Gazette Hundreds of people turned up at hospital emergency wards yesterday with hip, leg and arm fractures resulting from nasty spills on ice-glazed driveways, sidewalks and streets. Virtually every school board in and around Montreal, including the Montreal Catholic School Commission and Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal, canceled classes, as did Concordia University's Loyola campus. And the ice storm, the worst to hit the city in nearly 40 years, isn't over. Environment Canada is calling for more rain and freezing rain throughout the Montreal region over the next several days. Getting around should prove to be equally treacherous today. Hydro-Quebec says it will be days before its crews finish repairing power lines and clearing away broken tree branches. And municipal crews will be salting and scraping streets and sidewalks for days before their job is done. Transport Quebec closed Metropolitan Blvd. and one lane of Decarie Blvd. in both directions overnight to remove the snow and ice that clogged drains and snarled traffic, axle-deep in water, yesterday. Both arteries were to reopen at 5:30 today. Highway 15 was also closed last night between de Salaberry and Cartier in Laval for snow removal, but reopens early this morning. There's no guarantee the chaos that reigned at Dorval airport yesterday will have improved for air travelers coming and going this morning. We have no reason to believe things will be improving, said Air Canada spokesman Priscille Leblanc. And there's nothing we can do about it as long as this weather continues. Yesterday, most flights in and out of Dorval were delayed by 1 hour or more as planes lined up for de-icing. What's more, most airline staff on duty yesterday were an hour or more late reporting for work, Leblanc said, because of treacherous road conditions. By midday, 20 flights - nearly half the 48 regularly scheduled arrivals and departures - had been canceled. Pierre Morrissette of He Perrot and his wife, Suzanne, spent the first night of their winter vacation at an airport hotel in Toronto because they missed their connection to Barbados. He said they arrived at Dorval yesterday at 4:45 a.m. to catch a 6 a.m. plane to Toronto, in what he thought was plenty of time to make a 9:30 a.m. flight to Barbados. It was not to be. The first employee to show up at the Air Canada counter didn't get there until 15 minutes before the flight was supposed to leave, Morrissette fumed while killing time at Pearson airport in Toronto. By then the lineups were endless. Then the flight was canceled. The next flights were delayed and by the time we finally got out of there it was too late. Closer to home, there was so much panic that the administrators of the region's 911 emergency line put out an urgent appeal to Montrealers to stop calling except in cases of crisis. Richard Boyer, director of the 911 emergency centre, said his operators fielded 5,300 calls yesterday morning. That's 1,300 more than they get all day on average. Boyer said 1,500 were calls from people complaining of broken tree branches. They jammed the lines and forced others with real health emergencies to wait to speak with an operator. The lines have been overloaded. It's one call after another, many from people who are not really in any danger, Boyer said in an interview. We are urging people to be patient, to wait until the crews have had a chance to do their work. Suzanne Daningburg and her three A6 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 7, 1998 THE BIG FREEZE JOHN MAHONEY, GAZETTE F-word follows another Freezing rain, flooding cause nightmare for road crews DAVID JOHNSTON The Gazette It was an unusual combination: freezing rain and flooding. Both at the same time. As ice pellets pounded down on southwestern Quebec during morning rush hour yesterday, road crews responded with massive salting of major highways and urban thoroughfares. The salt melted the ice all right, but the resulting water failed to drain into the sewer system. Reason: manhole covers were plugged up. Result: widespread flooding on sections of highways and busy city streets. So many manhole covers were plugged by frozen snow and heavy slush yesterday morning that the volume of water circulating through the Montreal Urban Community's sewer system was less than the average for a dry Montreal morning. In an average dry morning, water flows through the island's sewer system at a rate of 30 cubic metres per second in the form of residential, industrial and commercial waste; none of it is due to precipitation. At 7 a.m. yesterday, the MUC sewage engineers recorded a flow of 29 cubic metres. The manhole covers all just got plugged up, said Rejean Levesque, director of the MUC sewage-treatment plant. Sometimes we see the same phenomenon in the fall when leaves plug up manhole covers, preventing drainage during a major storm. As yesterday progressed, municipal road crews worked to unplug manholes and curbside catch basins designed to catch storm waters. Peter Clark, director of public works for Pointe Claire, said his crews had unplugged probably hundreds of manholes and catch basins. With a mixture of rain and freezing rain forecast for the rest of the week, it's hard to say what curbside and sidewalk conditions will be like. If temperatures rise above freezing, slush and ice will thaw into water - and as long as manhole covers simultaneously open, all that water will drain within 24 hours, Levesque said. If the resulting drainage volume exceeds the sewage system's treatment capacity of 80 cubic metres of water per second, the surplus will be discharged untreated into the St Lawrence River and Riviere des Prairies through 180 outfall pipes, he added. Yesterday's flooding was worst on major highways, which must be heavily salted for safety reasons, and in municipalities like the city of Montreal that had not cleaned their streets of snow that fell during the holiday season. We'd worked like the devil to clean our streets of snow, said Clark, because you wouldn't have wanted to get anything on top of what we got between Christmas and New Year's. Loft: Pedestrians along Édouard Montpetit Blvd. yesterday were forced to find a way around fallen tree limbs at McKenna St. Below: Andrew Leaver wore protective headgear while chipping ice from his car in Saint-Lambert. JOHN KENNEY, GAZETTE vision The Gazette Grappling with the worst ice storm to hit the region in nearly four decades, and with more freezing rain in the forecast, Hydro-Quebec warned yesterday that blackouts won't end quickly. It's going to be long, it's going to be hard, and it's going to take several days, Hydro spokesman Steve Flana- gan told reporters. Act responsibly and find a comfortable place to stay. Heavy accumulations of ice and broken tree limbs snapped power lines across a wide swath from Hull to Drummondville, but the Montreal region bore the brunt of the damage. One death was reported, that of an 82-year-old man of carbon-monoxide poisoning from a gas generator in his basement. Rolland Parent of Papineauville, east of Hull, installed the generator after his power went out. By 10 p.m., Hydro crews had re-established electricity to just over 60,000 customers in the Montreal region. There were still 332,000 clients without electricity on the South Shore and 124,000 in the Laurentians and the Outaouais. On the island of Montreal, there were 235,000 households without power - a little less than 25 per cent of Hydro's customers on the island. At Dorval airport yesterday, 20 morning flights were canceled and many others were delayed for 90 minutes or more in lineups awaiting de-icing. Hundreds of people went to hospital emergency wards for treatment of fractures suffered in falls on icy walks, and thousands showed up for work an hour or more late because of treacherous road conditions.

Page A1 A small miracle Firefighter saves 2-year-old in LaSalle YVONNE ZACHARIAS The Gazette Through the smoke and darkness, Ron Monahan ran his coarse firefighter's hands over the rumpled bedsheets. He was looking for a body - a baby, the one Maleha Amrov couldn't get back to save when a storm and then a huge electrical fire shattered the quiet of her LaSalle home. Monahan could hear Amrov's cries outside: My baby, my baby. He dropped to his hands and knees and ran those big hands over the floor. He felt a foot. Then inch by inch, he located a tiny body under the bed. I got her, I got her, he yelled to no one, to nothing but the empty darkness. He pulled on the foot. But there was no reaction, no moaning, no nothing. Right then, I knew something was very wrong. That's when the pounding in his chest started. Cradling her, he stumbled through the darkness, outside the door and to the only light he could find - a streetlamp surrounded by a pool of water. He got his first look at the human treasure tucked in his massive arms. Her face, framed by curly brown hair, was covered in soot, and her lips were blue. Monahan couldn't see breathing. He tried, a few hours later, to describe the terrible loneliness that washed over him under the streetlamp, standing deep in water, a storm raging around him. His eyes filled with tears: I'm on the street and I'm alone. Monahan paused for a moment, then searched for the right words. I really felt alone. There was nobody around, he offered weakly. He lifted the baby in his arms, lowered his face and carefully clamped his lips over her nose and mouth, just like they'd taught him in training. One breath in. No response. He later said that he'd prayed silently to himself: Please, God, please, God. Make this right, make me do the right thing. Please, please, make her come back. Another breath. Then a tiny cough. Please see RESCUE, Page A2 As the extent of the damage became known, Montreal and a number of suburbs opened emergency shelters for people left without electricity.

That's why much of southern Quebec was slipping and sliding yesterday through another ice storm. Actually, it's the St. Lawrence River Valley that sucks cold air from the northeast, Environment Canada meteorologist Pierre Pommainville said yesterday. That cold air, when it lies under a mass of warm moist air that has moved up from the Gulf of Mexico, is what makes freezing rain. And this year, thanks to the El Nino effect in the Pacific Ocean, we can expect more freezing rain than usual, said Lawrence Mysak, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at McGill University and past president of the Canadian Academy of Sciences. Yesterday's storm, which dumped about 23 millimetres of freezing rain at Dorval airport, was about the fourth or fifth worst storm on record, Pommainville said. The worst was Feb. 25, 1961, when 21.5 millimetres fell in one 24-hour period, leading to an ice coating 3 centimetres thick. Pommainville said the Montreal region can expect another 5 to 10 millimetres of freezing rain today. Rain in January is not unusual, he said, noting that the first month of the year usually racks up about 20 millimetres of rain at the Dorval weather station. When rain from the warm air aloft passes through a low-altitude layer of below-zero air that has been drawn down into the St. Lawrence Valley, from Sept-Iles to Montreal, it freezes on contact and the fun begins on sidewalks, roads and driveways. If the rain has a chance to freeze on the way down, we get ice pellets. That's the good news. The bad news is that this year could be a nasty one for freezing rain because of a periodic climatological effect called El Nino. Named for the baby Jesus because it begins to appear in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of South America at about Christmas time with a relaxation of the normal east-to-west trade winds, the El Nino phenomenon results in the shift of a large pool of warm water from west to east in the Pacific, affecting weather in many parts of the globe. The results can be devastating. In 1982-83, the most pronounced El Nino effect recorded, about $8 billion in damage was attributed to weather around the world. So far, this El Nino is huge compared with '82-'83, Mysak said, referring to the substantial rise of up to 5 or 6 degrees Celsius in Pacific surface temperatures that has been recorded as well as the lengthy duration of this El Nino, which began last summer. Savage storms can be expected along the Pacific coasts of North and Central America, leading to landslides and flooding, while severe drought is forecast from southern Africa to Australia. And Montrealers can look forward to a yo-yo of a winter, where the temperature could plummet with a blast of dry Arctic air or stay mild enough to produce copious quantities of rain, freezing rain, ice pellets or wet snow. While yesterday's storm might not be directly attributable to El Nino, it was consistent with the kind of weather the effect can produce, Mysak said. The principal forces governing our weather during an El Nino period are a huge high-pressure system over Winnipeg and a massive low over the Gulf of Mexico near Florida, said Mysak. These systems, along with an Aleutian low, are more intense than normal and form what is called the Pacific North America Teleconnection Pattern. The high over Winnipeg spins clockwise, forcing cold air from the north down into eastern Canada and sucking warm, dry air up from Texas and the U.S. 12919 The Gazette number is 6000. Please recycle this paper More REGION Continued from Page A1 Other shelters on the island were opened in LaSalle, Verdun and Town of Mount Royal. The Fairview shopping centre in Pointe Claire stayed open overnight to shelter West Islanders left without power. On the South Shore, a number of cities and towns - including Saint-Bruno, Greenfield Park, Saint-Lambert, Longueuil and Candiac - were offering emergency accommodation for residents. The widespread power outages left Hydro officials grasping for adjectives. Lucy Bertrand, vice-president (customer service), said the storm damage appeared to be even worse than last winter's freak ice showers that left hundreds of thousands of people in the Lanaudiere region without electricity for more than a week. Last year was exceptional, she said. This is even more exceptional. The area is a lot bigger, and many more customers have been affected. Bertrand refused to predict when customers, some of whom have been without power since late Monday, will have power restored. It all depends on the weather, she said. We hope the situation will stabilize. Bertrand said yesterday's relatively mild temperatures were a mixed blessing; they kept power consumption low, but if a cold snap arrived, pushing up demand, more blackouts could follow. More than 2,000 Hydro employees were working around the clock to inspect power lines, clear fallen trees and repair damage. Public institutions like hospitals and old-age homes that were without electricity were the utility's first priority. At least five area health-care centres - including the Jewish, Lakeshore General and Charles Lemoyne hospitals - had to rely on emergency power for most of the day. Workers restored electricity to 25,000 customers between noon and 4 p.m., but couldn't keep pace with expanding power failures. Additional crews from the Quebec City and Abitibi regions were supposed to be on the job by early evening. Emergency workers from utilities in the northeastern United States were on standby should the predicted freezing rain worsen the problem, as it might well do. Environment Canada is forecasting freezing rain for the next few days. Today, we should get freezing rain in the morning, turning to drizzle this afternoon. The temperature today is expected to hover around the freezing point. But tomorrow will be worse. Meteorologists are predicting more freezing rain, but it will be accompanied by ice pellets. The high will be around minus-2 Celsius. And there's another low-pressure system heading our way after that, said meteorologist Steve McCusky. We should feel its effects by Friday. It doesn't look like this weather will end before the weekend, McCusky said. By last night, about 23 millimetres of precipitation had fallen since early Monday. The freezing rain and drizzle is being caused by cold air that's trapped in the St. Lawrence River valley between the Earth's surface and warmer, humid air above. As the precipitation falls through the colder air, it freezes, turning to ice pellets or freezing rain as it hits the Earth. In a steady drizzle on Notre Dame de Grace's Oxford Ave. yesterday afternoon, Hydro workers Daniel Cote and Roch Petit struggled to haul dangling tree limbs from sagging wires. With each shift of the breeze, more ice-laden branches fell from the trees above them. I was in the Lanaudiere last year, but this is much worse, Cote said. There are so many trees and wires in such a close space. Petit was succinct. It's hell, he said. Donald Fraser, a crew foreman surveying lines on du Manoir Ave. in Outremont, said he knew the damage would be severe when the storm continued through Monday. He and his assistant had been on the job since 3 a.m. I've never seen anything like it, the veteran Hydro employee said. Fraser said he fears things may get worse before they get better. The worst thing that could happen now is wind. If the breeze picks up, all of these ice-covered trees will just snap. Jean Lapointe, who lives in a nearby apartment block that had been without power since early morning, said the building was becoming uncomfortable. It's not a joke. The whole building does not have any heat. In addition to the tens of thousands of smaller power-line breaks, seven large hydro towers along the Nicolet-to-Boucherville corridor collapsed under the weight of ice yesterday. High-tension wires blocked a portion of Highway 20 near Drummondville for part of the day, but the road had reopened by nightfall. A Hydro official said power was quickly rerouted to another transmission line and the fallen towers did not contribute to the blackout. But the damage will take months to repair, she said. Pierre Martel, Montreal region director of Quebec's Public Security Department, said the situation, though dire, was not considered a true emergency because so far there has been no need for mass evacuations. However, Martel advised people to take the blackout and its inherent dangers seriously. If you have a heating source other than electricity, use it moderately. Or go (and stay with) a friend or family. He warned people not to try to heat their homes with barbecues, camp stoves or other outdoor heaters because of the danger of carbon-monoxide poisoning. He also cautioned people to steer clear of fallen wires, even if they seem to be inert. Martel said perishables should keep in a closed fridge or freezer for one or two days but people should throw food out if they doubt its freshness. Much of Ottawa-Hull remained frozen last night in the grip of the storm, which knocked out power and downed trees in most neighbourhoods, and disrupted air and road traffic. SUSAN SEMENAK AND MONIQUE BEAUDIN OF THE GAZETTE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS REPORT Phone your town about damage caused by the storm DAVE SIDAWAY, GAZETTE Firefighter Ron Monahan (right) gives Jenanne Amrov a teddy bear at the Montreal Children's Hospital as her father, Mahmoud Amrov, looks on. Baby's cries bring tears RESCUE Continued from Page A1 Relief came over Monahan like fine spray from a firefighter's hose. He clamped his big, clumsy firefighter's breathing apparatus over the baby's chubby face. Her eyes opened and closed - it was like she was in and out. Mahmoud Amrov was at his elbow. His wife was fine. So were four of his children. But what about his little Jenanne? Was she going to be OK, too? Monahan lost track of time. He lost track of the other firefighters - even his partner, Jean Beaudet, who had gone off to search one part of the master bedroom while Monahan plunged into the darkness on the other side, where Jenanne had been curled up for the night. But somehow Monahan remembered there was a hospital a short distance away. It wasn't exactly procedure, but he spotted Mahmoud Amrov's car and said: Let's go. They sped over sidewalks, around fallen branches, over clumps of ice and straight inside a door left open for ambulances. Monahan's knees were buckling. I ran into the emergency room. There wasn't a soul there. I'm opening doors like a madman in the emergency room, and finally they directed me to the intensive-care unit. It was there that he heard the baby with the big brown eyes cry for the first time. Now that did it for me, Monahan's voice choked and his eyes flooded. It was hard to explain, even when it was all over. Yesterday, a city shuddered and shook itself awake to an ice-glazed world outside. There were fallen branches, padlocked schools and fires like the one at 6:15 a.m. that destroyed the Amrov home at 8534 Champlain Blvd. in LaSalle. Police think it was caused by a power surge after an electrical blackout caused by the storm. But there was a small miracle, too. Two-year-old Jenanne Amrov was alive, recovering after being transferred to the Montreal Children's Hospital because one firefighter wanted nothing more in the world than to bring her back to life. While light dawned on a city of dark houses, a 40-year-old man trudged out of a fire station in LaSalle. He felt good, a little proud, terribly at peace with himself. The sky showered a fine mist on him as he rode through empty streets. And when he got home, smelling of smoke, his eyes bleary, he leaned over and gently kissed his 11-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. Monahan became a firefighter 17 years ago because he wanted to help people. This time, he thinks, maybe he succeeded. Don't phone 911 - it should be used only in the event of emergencies.

Xianda,237,"THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 9, 1998 A3 THE BIG FREEZE Transportation falls victim to weather Freezing rain turns highways into rivers of slush and railway lines into sheets of ice AARON DERFEL The Gazette Most trains, planes and automobiles ground to a halt yesterday as the second ice storm in a week battered the Montreal region's transportation network. Freezing rain turned highways into rivers of slush and rail lines into sheets of ice. Many motorists chose to stay home rather than venture out in the treacherous weather. Major airlines canceled flights in and out of Montreal, bus trips were delayed by as much as 45 minutes and train service was disrupted. At Dorval Airport, hundreds of commuters sat forlornly in the food court for hours on end, waiting to catch one of the few flights out of the city. ""It's like Siberia out there!"" Taline Kabadjian, 38, said as she picked at a half-eaten pastry. Kabadjian, who lives in Nice, flew to Montreal last week for a family visit. ""But I can't wait to go home,"" she said, tears streaming down her cheeks. ""I've done nothing here but stay indoors and watch TV."" Ben Yankson, 21, arrived at the airport from Calgary a day late and was lounging in the terminal for hours, hoping to be picked up by his girlfriend. ""The problem is I can't reach her by phone,"" Yankson said. ""I don't know where she is and I'm hoping she'll come and get me. I'm a patient guy, but this is too much,"" he added. The airlines canceled 255 flights in and out of Dorval, up from 200 on Wednesday even though the runways were clear. The ice storm forced Transport Quebec to close 30 highways for most of the day and 13 were still off-limits late last night. Montreal Island highways, however, remained open and work crews were busy de-icing them overnight. Via Rail canceled its train routes west of Toronto in both directions because of fallen debris on tracks. ""The bus drivers are being very careful on the road because of the icy conditions,"" officials said they expected some lines would stay shut this morning. ""This is probably the first time that service from Toronto to the east coast has been canceled in a single day,"" Via spokesman Malcolm Andrews said. Commuter-train service was also hampered. The Montreal-Rigaud line has been closed until further notice, while there will be no service between Dorion and Rigaud until Monday. The other commuter lines should run normally. West Island commuters who thought they'd get to work early yesterday morning by rushing for commuter train No. 10 had another think coming. After pulling into Beaconsfield station about 20 minutes late, the 7:42 a.m. Montreal-bound train ground to a halt one kilometer short of Dorval station when live electrical wires were spotted on the track. As many as 400 passengers were then told to disembark and walk to Dorval, where they could board buses bound for the Lionel Groulx metro station. At the Montreal bus station, trips to New York and Boston were canceled, while passengers had to endure delays for up to 45 minutes on all other routes. ""The bus drivers are being very careful on the road because of the icy conditions,"" bus terminal official Patricia Papineau said. The Montreal South Shore Transit Corp. cut 40 of its rush hour bus routes in the afternoon, leaving commuters with only the 21 major ones to get home. The transit system could no longer keep up after three days of blackouts at all three of its garages, which left only backup generators to provide power for lighting, vehicle-repair equipment and a few fuel pumps, communications director Raymond Allard said. The Sureté du Quebec reported fewer highway accidents than in normal weather conditions because most motorists chose to stay at home. ""The rush hour was quite calm,"" Constable Francois Dore said. ""Fewer and fewer people are taking to the road and we expect that to continue today."" Debbie Parkes and Claude Arpin of The Gazette contributed to this report. Storm bringing people together Kahnawake elders look on bright side LYNN MOORE The Gazette Gratitude for an ice storm that has walloped their region hard, knocking out power to about half a million South Shore residents, is about the last thing one might expect from residents. But Joe Deer, his wife, Josie Deer, and other elders of Kahnawake figure that the storm has provided a set of opportunities that might come once or twice a generation. ""It's getting the people back together and it reminds people of their relationship with other people,"" Joe Deer told visitors to his Kahnawake home yesterday. An estimated 60 to 70 percent of Kahnawake's homes and businesses were without power yesterday afternoon. Evidence of the enduring storm was inescapable in the region. 200 COTS READY In Chateauguay, ice-laden trees partially blocked some riverside roads while Longueuil officials warned motorists, especially truck drivers, to avoid secondary roads and low-hanging, ice-laden power lines. Kahnawake's emergency shelter provided about 300 suppers last night and 200 cots were at the ready to serve as beds. ""We are prepared,"" community-services committee member Rheena Diabo said. And word of the shelter had been spread. About 15,000 notices had been distributed, advising people of the shelter set up at the Knights of Columbus hall. Local radio station K103, using an emergency generator, alerted residents to news of the shelter and conservation officers had traveled in trucks and all-terrain vehicles to outlying homes, offering those residents a lift into town. But about 55 elderly or infirm people who had no power or heat refused to leave their homes, Diabo said. ""They grew up during the Depression and take this in stride,"" she said. ""They are tough and they know what to do."" They do have wood-burning stoves and light sources, Diabo added. And authorities or family members check on them regularly, she said. Deer, who is pushing 76 and breaks out the ceremonial tobacco when visitors arrive at his home, understands the stand taken by his contemporaries. So does Kellyann Meloche, who turns 23 next week, and uses computers, cellular telephones and fax machines in her job as coordinator of emergency planning for the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake. ""They (the community elders) have been through tough times. For them, this is not difficult. And they have wood stoves. Now everyone is gathering around the stoves in their homes and talking. They like it that their children and grandchildren can come and sit around the fire and talk about things,"" Meloche explained. Among the items on Meloche's agenda yesterday were meetings with other emergency workers and council members to determine whether a state of emergency should be declared in Kahnawake. Another item was what the community's response would be to any possible offers of assistance from the Canadian Forces. It was a topic that Meloche approached gingerly yesterday. (During the 1990 Oka crisis, emotions ran high as armed Mohawks blocked the Mercier Bridge in solidarity with Mohawks in Kanesatake locked in a 78-day standoff against provincial police and the army.) ""These are certainly different circumstances,"" Meloche said. ""I know that a lot of people have put '90 in the past. For instance, we have got cots (for Kahnawake's shelter) from the Red Cross and there was a time in '90 when it refused to come in here because they deemed Kahnawake a war zone. But now we are working with them."" Damage from ice will be most costly GEOFF BAKER The Gazette A senior insurance official now says the ice storm that has ravaged southern Quebec this week will cost more to fix than any other winter weather disaster in Canadian history. ""I think this is definitely the worst storm where insurance was involved in terms of winter storms,"" said Raymond Medza, general manager for the Quebec region of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. Medza said that from the initial reports he's been getting, the cost of storm damage should rise well into the tens of millions of dollars when his umbrella association, which counts about 140 insurers in Quebec, starts getting financial estimates from members next week. Costly winter storms are unusual, he said, since the biggest inconveniences are usually limited to traffic chaos and not physical damage. The insurance bureau began tracking storm costs after the July 14, 1987, flood in Montreal that resulted in payouts of about $70 million. Financial damage from storms before that would have trouble cracking today's Top-50 list because of inflation and Medza said none of the winter ones - including Montreal's so-called ""storm of the century"" in March 1971 - come even close to what this week's will cost. ""I was in this same office I'm in now back in 1971 and I was stranded here for two days,"" he said of the storm that dropped 47 centimeters of snow in Montreal on March 3 and 4 of that year. ""We actually had a pretty good time here. While the streets were blocked and you couldn't go anywhere, you didn't have power failures or tree branches crashing down on cars and homes."" The most expensive winter storm recorded in Canada from an insurance perspective was a March 1991 tornado that tore through Sarnia, Ont., and caused $25 million worth of insurable damage. None of Montreal's previous ice storms made the insurance bureau's list of the most costly Canadian natural disasters. ""Two people who work with me had tree branches crash through their roofs,"" Medza said the heaviest storm damage occurs during the summer months, when high winds can cause tornadoes and excessive rain brings sewer backups and floods homes. Of the 48 most costly Canadian storms, 31 of them occurred during the months of July and August. But it was on Sept. 7, 1991, that a severe hail storm rained down on the city of Calgary, causing $342 million in insurable damage to homes and cars - the highest total recorded by any natural disaster in Canada's history. Quebec's worst insurance bill was for $212 million after the July 1996 flooding in the Saguenay - although about $108 million of that total came from one company reporting three commercial-property claims.

The same weather system that has dumped more than 50 millimeters - and counting - of icy precipitation on southwestern Quebec this week has also wreaked havoc on eastern Ontario and several U.S. states. More than 200,000 Ontario Hydro customers in the areas of Ottawa, Kingston and Cornwall were left without power yesterday, and officials said it may be days before service is re-established. ""It's difficult to tell how long this is going to take, the weather is really working against us,"" said Ontario Hydro spokesman Al Manchee. ""It could be a matter of hours for some and a matter of days for others."" In Ottawa, more than 30,000 of the 110,000 Hydro customers in the city were without power yesterday morning, and the storm was again blamed for wiping out progress made earlier in the week. ""We're right back in the thick of things now,"" Hydro spokesman Dan Ralph said. City officials declared a state of emergency, and Ralph said it will be at least another 24 hours before the damage is repaired. The weather and Ottawa airport delays have forced Prime Minister Jean Chretien and the provincial premiers to postpone from Saturday to Sunday their departure on a trade mission to Latin America. While storm-struck people in Ottawa and Montreal scramble to find flashlights and friends with electricity, people living in the surrounding countryside are facing other challenges, like helping their animals survive and dealing with isolation. At the Claire farmhouse in Vankleek Hill, Ont., the phone was ringing off the hook - just about the only appliance that is still working since the ice storm hit. ""No, I don't have a generator, I need a generator,"" Lorie Claire explained to a fellow dairy farmer on the other end of the line. ""We've been out since Monday. Oh God, it's terrible."" NOT GOING ANYWHERE Hundreds of Montrealers have fled their frigid homes for the warmth of a hotel room, but Warren and Lois Gamble endured their third night without power in Notre Dame de Grace to keep an eye on their dog, two cats and a budgie. The couple, both 68, bundled up in sweaters and winter jackets against the chilly 11C temperature in their home and spent part of last night reading newspapers by candlelight to pass the time. Bouchard praises Quebecers Solidarity and acts of kindness are unprecedented, he says PHILIP AUTHIER The Gazette Premier Lucien Bouchard last night praised Quebecers' efforts to deal with the freezing rain ice storm, saying the level of solidarity and acts of kindness they are showing is unprecedented. Bouchard, who was forced to abandon his own Outremont apartment and is staying with his family in a hotel because of the power failure, said it's warming to see ordinary citizens pulling together at a time of crisis. ""I have full admiration for the way the people of Quebec are supporting those difficult times,"" Bouchard said at a press conference held at his offices in the Hydro-Quebec building downtown. ""They are patient. They are courageous and they show a marvelous solidarity. It's really warming to see how much people are reaching to help each other, how they open their homes. I think this is the recipe of success. I hope this manifestation of patience and solidarity will hold on because we need some more days. I want them to be assured that Hydro-Quebec, the municipalities, that so many people from outside Quebec, are really giving a hand to get out of it."" Bouchard said Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin and Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon had also called him to offer their own hydro workers to help bring Quebec's power system back. American states are also lending a hand, offering personnel to Hydro-Quebec, he said. Inside Quebec, Bouchard said the show of solidarity is unprecedented, from individuals taking in friends and relatives to hotel owners offering reduced rates for those who have been ousted from their homes. He mentioned Hydro workers who are putting in long shifts to reconnect homes and the work of hundreds of volunteers helping people cope. He said government and municipal officials have now opened 154 shelters in the province for those with nowhere to go and said the government is looking at opening another huge center at the former Saint-Jean military college which could accommodate 2,500 people. DON MAC DONALD OF THE GAZETTE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS REPORT City runs out of rooms DAVID JOHNSTON The Gazette There was no room at the inn. A Montreal company that keeps a centralized computer record of hotel bookings on behalf of 22,000 two-star or better hotel rooms in greater Montreal said only eight hotel rooms in four hotels in its network that still had power early yesterday evening hadn't been booked. ""And those rooms became available only because of late-afternoon cancellations,"" said Gilbert Deschenes, co-owner of Hospitalite Canada Tours, the company that operates the central reservations system. ""So basically, everything was booked. It will prove to be the busiest night of 1998."" Unless, of course, there's no room at the inn again tonight as well. DIGGING IN ""I'm staying as long as it takes,"" Benita Greenspon of Notre Dame de Grace said early last evening, as she stood in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel on Sherbrooke St. This is Greenspon's first stay in the ritzy Ritz. She booked in Wednesday, and says she's having a great time. ""I've brought my dog, and I'm trying to make a mini-vacation of it all,"" she said. She's taking advantage of a special $98-a-night ice-storm rate introduced by the hotel on Tuesday afternoon. Greenspon, a businesswoman, is staying in a room that would normally go for $150 in winter and $250 in summer. ""Most of our local guests are from Saint-Lambert.""

But Prime Minister Jean Chretien's surprise appointment yesterday of Ian Binnie is being criticized as a missed opportunity to appoint another woman to the country's top court. ""It's absolutely mind-boggling,"" said University of Calgary professor Kathleen Mahoney. ""Fifty percent of the people in Canada are women and there are so many good women on the bench that they can no longer justify just two women out of nine on the Supreme Court of Canada."" University of Ottawa professor Ed Ratushny agreed that, while Binnie will make an excellent judge, several strong female judges on the Ontario Court of Appeal could have received the nod. Fifty-eight-year-old Binnie, a partner with the country's largest national law firm, McCarthy Tetrault, replaces Justice John Sopinka, who died suddenly late last year. He is Chretien's second appointment to the high court - New Brunswick Judge Michel Bastarache was appointed in October to replace retiring Gerard La Forest. Mild-mannered and publicity-shy, the Montreal-born, Cambridge-educated lawyer has represented a wide variety of clients during his 30-year legal career, ranging from large corporations to Guy Paul Morin, who was wrongfully convicted of killing his neighbor. Binnie is also no stranger to Ottawa, having spent four years as assistant deputy minister of Justice in the 1980s, responsible for all litigation by or against the federal government. He has appeared before the Supreme Court more than 25 times, arguing both for and against the federal government on issues ranging from gay rights to cruise-missile testing. He has represented the media in several important cases, including challenges to the publication ban in the Karla Homolka case and to a law that restricts the reporting of opinion polls in the days before federal elections. Binnie has extensive constitutional experience. Besides arguing numerous cases involving the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, he recently represented Newfoundland in its bid for constitutional reforms to its religious-based education system and was counsel to a Senate-Commons committee on the Meech Lake accord in the late 1980s. Chief Justice Antonio Lamer said Binnie will be sworn in Feb. 2 and will spend the following few weeks preparing for the hearings on Quebec's right to secede unilaterally, which will proceed as scheduled on Feb. 16. He said Binnie's appointment from private practice will help keep the court in touch with the society it serves. Chretien defended the appointment even though there are only two women on the top court - Claire L'Heureux-Dube and Beverley McLachlin. He said Justice Minister Anne McLellan recommended a lawyer from private practice to replace Sopinka. ""It's not a question of numbers. We do not select based on sex and language and religion and color. We try to have the best person available,"" said Chretien, who as justice minister appointed Bertha Wilson as the first woman on the top court. Ontario lawyer is called sharp, funny Binnie steps into late John Sopinka's shoes JIM BRONSKILL Southam News OTTAWA - The magazine article featured prominent lawyer John Sopinka, but the accompanying photograph was of colleague Ian Binnie. It was an easy mistake to make: the two legal eagles, with neatly trimmed mustaches and wide-rimmed glasses, looked strikingly similar. The 1988 mugshot mix-up eerily foreshadowed events to come. Binnie, appointed yesterday to the Supreme Court, fills the vacancy left by Sopinka's untimely November death. Both men made the rare leap from careers as practicing lawyers to the country's highest bench. And the similarities do not end there. Associates say Binnie possesses two of Sopinka's finest traits - the ability to distill complex arguments into simple language and a warm sense of humor. ""The late John Sopinka, in the opinion of most, is irreplaceable,"" said Ottawa lawyer David Scott. ""But Ian is certainly a worthy successor, tragic as John's departure was."" A constitutional expert, Binnie has handled cases on a wide range of subjects, including freedom of expression, pharmaceutical regulation, free trade, aboriginal issues and international boundaries. As a young man, Binnie's formidable intellect led him to England's Cambridge University, where he earned a law degree before returning to Canada to continue his studies. After establishing a track record in private practice, he served four years as associate deputy justice minister in the federal government. In 1986, he joined the law firm McCarthy Tetrault. Peter Russell, a law professor at the University of Toronto, said the Supreme Court will benefit from Binnie's solid experience in constitutional and international affairs. ""A lot of the court's most challenging work ahead lies in those fields."" Binnie hinted that joining the court will not prevent him from occasionally wading into debates about how the law applies to current events. ""I certainly think that judges are accountable, because they exercise a lot of authority on matters that are important to individuals,"" he said. ""I don't think they should be immune from criticism and I don't think that they should pretend that their views are of no importance and, therefore, not speak out."" Binnie said he was ""astonished"" when he was approached last month to see whether he would be a candidate. ""I had not applied for any judicial position and there was certainly no lobby,"" he said. ""The process that produced it is something that I don't know about."" He said, ""I've been to the Supreme Court often enough as a lawyer and it's going to be interesting to see it from the other side of the bench."" Binnie said he is a fan of the charter and is prepared to use it to strike down laws. ""I think when the charter was brought, it was intended to be used constructively and creatively, and I think that's what the court has done. The elected legislators gave the courts the tools by which they have invalidated some laws."" It's not as if the courts have usurped the power that the parliamentarians never intended to confer. ""I don't know that I can pigeonhole myself as a conservative or liberal or activist. I think those concepts are applied by others to judges when they see what kind of track record is developed. That will emerge over time."" Binnie has four children with wife Susan, who works for the Law Society of Upper Canada. Daughter Alexandra is a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in England. Although he typically has a full legal plate, Binnie has made time for gardening, skiing and sailing. He is invariably described as kind and personable, but not to be taken lightly in the courtroom. A colleague remembers a 1992 boundary dispute with France in which Binnie, representing Ottawa, boiled down a confusing point into an amusing analogy about a joint bank account. The story not only clearly explained the point, but had the French lawyer and the judge in gales of laughter, recalls the associate. ""Not an easy thing to do. It's certainly one of the key features of his approach to difficult issues, to get at the essence of them and to express that in very simple, very matter-of-fact but very persuasive language."" Binnie was often called in to rescue floundering cases on appeal - for example, last year he persuaded the Supreme Court to let three Nazi war-crimes cases proceed despite a secret meeting between a judge and a senior federal lawyer. ""He's one of the best lawyers in Canada and he's the kind of person we need on the Supreme Court of Canada,"" said Osgoode Hall law professor Patrick Monahan. Scott sees Binnie intellectually as something of an iron fist in a velvet glove. ""One should not confuse his very gentle appearance and approach as any timidity or absence of focus or purpose,"" he said. ""He knows exactly what he's doing.""

Bouchard accepts Canadian Forces aid BLACKOUT Continued from Page A1 Environment Canada is forecasting another 10 millimeters of freezing rain for Montreal today, but they expect it to end in the late afternoon. Tomorrow and Sunday, it will be cloudy with a few sunny breaks and a 30- to 40-percent chance of flurries. Monday's forecast calls for up to 5 centimeters of snow and Tuesday is expected to be cloudy with a chance of flurries. Municipal authorities have set up 154 emergency shelters around the province, and spaces were filling up as night fell. All available rooms in metropolitan-area hotels that still had power were taken by 6 p.m. There have been six storm-related deaths so far, and more than 100 reported cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, as people tried to heat their homes with camp stoves and barbecues.

Workers sent home or SHEILA McGOVERN and ANDY RIGA The Gazette Thousands of workers were sent home early yesterday and told not to come back today. Others are being told they never have to leave - they can camp out in their heated workplaces, or bring the children to the office, or bring the whole family for a hot meal in the cafeteria. Across the Montreal region, major employers are scrambling to deal with the storm, which shows no signs of letting up. Overall, employers reported their staff are a resilient lot - with the majority struggling in every day, despite the fact that their homes are turning into ice palaces. But yesterday afternoon, some employers decided to call it quits. Pierre Martel, regional director of the provincial Public Security Department, urged all employers to be flexible with employees having trouble getting to work and, if possible, give them today off. Longueuil-based Pratt & Whitney sent 6,500 workers home until at least Sunday. CAE told its 4,000 employees how power gets to us (usually) Tremendously high voltage used for transmission over vast distances must be stepped down for household use. DOUG SWEET The Gazette Electricity is one of those things we tend to think about only when it's gone. Our lights, stoves, furnaces, water heaters, refrigerators, TV sets, VCRs, radios and computers work most of the time. We just push the button or twist the switch. We might ponder our use of power a bit more when we get our hydro bills, but then it's time to crank up the stereo or do the wash. Getting that electricity from dams to doorsteps in Quebec involves transmission over vast distances via the highest-voltage power lines on the continent. The electricity in household circuits typically flows at 110-240 volts (the higher number is for appliances like a stove or dryer) and 100 or 200 amperes, which is a measurement of current. But between James Bay and Jeanne Mance St, the voltage goes on a roller-coaster ride. It starts with water spinning a turbine in a power dam. That turns a generator, which produces about 13 or 14 kilo-volts of electricity.

Samaritans bringing joy to strangers MONIQUE BEAUDIN The Gazette Jolene Barton toughed it out at her Kirkland home without electricity for two days, but with her husband out of town and no hope of getting her power back, she threw in the towel Wednesday, packed up her two kids and headed for a downtown hotel. That's when she met her Good Samaritan, one of hundreds around the Montreal region who have been helping friends, neighbors and mostly complete strangers through the devastation of the continuing storm. Barton, a Kentucky native who moved here in July, hit a pothole on Highway 40 and blew one of the tires on her minivan. Stuck on a patch of ice, she and her two sons waited as car after car whizzed by, but none stopped to help. Fifteen minutes later, a shiny black Porsche stopped and a man ""dressed to the gills"" in a three-piece suit escorted her off the highway and followed her to a car dealership on St John's Blvd. It was closed, knocked out by the power failure, like several service stations at which she had stopped.

Murrow, wisely counseled commuters to stay home yesterday morning Fender-benders abounded on roads that were sheets of ice, Leckner reported, and attempting to drive anywhere was utterly foolhardy By noon, the temperature had risen sufficiently for Gord Sinclair to inform listeners that although they ""shouldn't break their necks to get there,"" the weather assured shoppers of attentive service at Furniture Wholesalers Sage advice from the old news director: too dangerous to go to work?

about 10 minutes before the freezing rain started The protest ended peacefully at 9 a.m., Montreal Urban Community police said Workers then began showing up at the garages, Bonin said As for punishing renegade blue-collar workers, Fortier told reporters that the provincial labour tribunal has the power to fine individuals who refuse to report for work And if anyone sues the city for damages that can be directly linked to the walkout, Fortier said, the city will then take the union to court But there are two versions of the latest tale of labour strife at city hall Local 301 official Michel Fontaine said the union warned city officials on Monday about the action Fontaine refused to name the officials He added that essential service was maintained during the protest Bourque aide Madeleine Champagne said that city manager Gerard Divay was ""vaguely warned"" recently about possible action, but was not given any dates Hebert said the subsidized-housing office was also caught off guard by yesterday's protest But she acknowledged that the agency was ""waiting to see whether something would happen, given the six-month anniversary of the strike, which began Aug. 3"" Hebert said the anniversary is actually today MUC police spokesman Luc Belhumeur said the blue-collar protesters had asked police for a permit before their demonstration However, when pressed for details, Belhumeur later said he couldn't confirm or deny whether a permit had been issued There are currently no disputes between the city and its blue-collar workers, whose contract doesn't expire until 2001 Negotiations between the housing office and its maintenance workers were suspended by a conciliator in mid-December No date has been set for another meeting between the two sides Opposition Councillor Helen Fotopulos criticized the Bourque administration yesterday for ""flagrant inaction"" on the labour dispute at the Office Municipal d'Habitation DAVE SIDAWAY, GAZETTE Ice chips flew yesterday when Daniel Sirois attacked the glazed windows of his car, parked on Notre Dame St. W. in Little Burgundy Traffic across the island STORM Continued from Page A1 Extra metro cars were thrown into service and rush-hour train frequency was extended by an hour until about 10:15, Paradis said Transit service for the disabled was canceled, except for emergency calls such as medical appointments By 9:20, after city crews had begun to spread salt and abrasive on streets, transit service was gradually returned to normal, Paradis said, although full service wasn't restored until about 11 a.m. Service for the disabled was brought back to normal about half an hour later On a normal day, the MUCTC records 487,000 surface-transit fares, Paradis said ""We've never had a disruption as big as this,"" she said ""And it wasn't just Montreal"" Yesterday's freezing rain caught most municipal and provincial public-works crews off guard ""By 6:45 a.m., the roads were all glazed over, but there was no sign of road crews anywhere,"" veteran traffic reporter Rick Leckner complained ""The accidents started at 7 a.m., and they came fast and furious Fifteen minutes later, every major road from Côte de Liesse to the Trans-Canada to the Decarie was a skating rink"" By 7:30 a.m., both the MUC police and the Sureté du Québec were urging people to stay home But it was too late; most major arteries were already jammed with stalled cars and fender-benders And for the next two hours, traffic across the island was virtually paralyzed Public transit was also disrupted in Laval, where as many as 300 buses, half the total, were taken out of service because of slippery roads, Richard Boyer of the Laval Transit Corp. said Full service was gradually reinstated beginning at 10 a.m. as road crews got salt and abrasive down, Boyer said About 20,000 passengers use the Laval service during morning rush hours, with about 9,000 of those headed for the Henri Bourassa metro station Travel was particularly slow over the bridges connecting Laval to Montreal Island, Boyer said At Dorval, thousands of would-be travelers languished at the airport yesterday morning During the peak morning travel period, no amount of de-icer or salt could keep Dorval's runways free of ice, said Normand Boivin, general manager of Aéroports de Montréal ""It started pretty suddenly at 6:45. Before that everything was bare and dry and conditions were perfect,"" Boivin told reporters at the airport, where many people who braved slick city streets and treacherous highways to get there found their flights delayed or canceled altogether ""Within five minutes everything was covered with ice and there was nothing we could do fast enough It was freezing on impact"" What's worse, even after crews managed to de-ice planes and two of three runways in Montreal, flights destined for Toronto found themselves with nowhere to go That's because Pearson International Airport was shrouded in dense fog all morning, as was the airport in Ottawa In all, Boivin said, half of about 300 domestic and international flights scheduled to take off from or land at Dorval yesterday morning didn't make it And even after Dorval's runways had been cleared, Boivin said, some pilots chose not to land there because of the weather conditions ""These were the worst situations we could face,"" Boivin said ""We'd rather have 15 inches of snow than 2 millimetres of ice"" Marielle Vigneau and her husband, Cyrice Lapierre, spent the day playing cards at Dorval airport, after their 8 a.m. flight home to the Magdalen Islands was postponed until 3 p.m. It was probably just as well, because they would have missed their flight anyway They didn't get to the airport until 9:30 a.m., after spending nearly two hours in traffic on Highway 20 Lloyd and Ruby Crozier of Calgary were supposed to fly to Miami via Toronto yesterday But they ended up stuck in Montreal instead The retired couple left home just before 1 a.m., headed for Toronto, but the pilot decided not to land there because of the fog He had just enough fuel to get to Montreal, where the freezing rain had barely begun falling ""We have no plans now,"" shrugged Ruby Crozier, waiting in line shortly before noon, trying to book another flight back to Toronto It was mid-afternoon before air traffic was back to normal at Air Canada, where one-third of flights were delayed or canceled Pierre Charbonneau, the airline's general manager (customer service), said all 25 canceled Air Canada flights were rescheduled by 12:30 p.m. It took Debra Chatfield one hour and 10 minutes to drive to work at McGill University from Lachine, a trip that usually takes 20 minutes ""Highway 20 was bumper to bumper, and on every corner downtown there were cars spinning their wheels and ambulances with the lights flashing,"" she said Leckner said much of the misery could have been avoided had the salt trucks gone out earlier ""It should have been no surprise that this was going to hit,"" he said ""Those trucks should have been out early this morning, before rush hour started But they fumbled the ball big time"" But Claude Laforest of Transport Quebec said nobody expected the freezing rain until 9 a.m. He said Transport Quebec salt spreaders were out as soon as it started, just before 7 a.m. ""It would have been a waste to salt too early, because it simply gets swept aside by the wind and traffic,"" Laforest said ""In LaSalle, the salt trucks didn't make it out of the garage until after 7:30"" ""Our biggest trouble was that our trucks got stuck in traffic on the icy streets,"" said Christian Dion, LaSalle's snow-removal chief ""We just weren't prepared for this What we had been expecting was 3 centimetres of snow"" While their Montreal counterparts walked off the job, Verdun's striking blue-collar workers actually went to work yesterday Verdun city manager Gaetan Laberge said workers agreed to salt city streets, even though they have been refusing to clear away snow Peter Clark, Pointe Claire's director of public works, said salting operations there were delayed two hours because of an erroneous weather forecast from its consultants THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1999 A3 CITY EDITOR: BRIAN KAPPLER (514) 987-2505 Lots of moans and broken bones That ice Emergency rooms at the larger Montreal hospitals were busy yesterday morning with ""S and F"" cases - people who slipped and fell on the ice, breaking bones in their tumble Downtown, by lunchtime, St. Luc Hospital had treated five people for storm-related fractures At the Montreal General Hospital, 12 people were on stretchers by mid-afternoon, all with bones broken as they fell on the ice ""Our waiting room is full, and there are also people in with a variety of bruises from falls on the ice,"" a spokesman at the General said In Côte-des-Neiges, the Jewish General Hospital had seen two people with dislocated shoulders and another eight for wrist fractures But considering the shape of the roads and sidewalks, hospitals were bracing for a much more hectic day ""We were expecting it to be much busier,"" said Debra Israel, a hospital spokesman, ""especially with hip injuries among the elderly, but it didn't happen ""I guess because the freezing rain started falling early in the morning, most of them just looked out the window and decided to stay home"" The Royal Victoria Hospital reported only one storm-related injury, a case of whiplash caused by a minor car accident The patient was treated and released yesterday Most of the injuries that resulted in emergency visits were in the morning After that, there was only a slight increase over what would normally be seen on a typical winter's day CHAOS IS KING OF THE ROAD Freezing rain, blue-collar strike leave motorists in terrible shape PAUL CHERRY and DEBBIE PARKES The Gazette Less than 4 millimetres of freezing rain and a wildcat strike by Montreal blue-collar workers combined to make a tough-to-swallow cocktail for many motorists during rush hour yesterday morning Shortly after 6:30, Montreal Urban Community police began receiving a steady stream of reports of car accidents in the city They ranged from the smallest of fender-benders to more serious collisions that caused injuries Downtown intersections like McGill College Ave. and Ste. Catherine St. W. resembled skating rinks Among the more ominous sights were those of buses sliding backward down hilly roads during the morning rush hour MUC police spokesman Luc Belhumeur said there were at least 30 minor car accidents reported during the three hours after the rain first started By that time police were asking people to leave their cars at home Belhumeur said most accidents involved only minor injuries but by noon the number of accidents reported in the MUC doubled At Station 26 in Côte-des-Neiges, an area encompassing several roads with steep inclines, many police officers were handling accident reports DOZENS OF CRASHES ""There were some crashes, especially involving buses, at least a dozen, but nothing major,"" said Constable Bruno Daelman Van Home Ave. was a special problem, he added Salt spreading was delayed in several parts of Montreal by the blue-collar workers' strike On the highways leading into the city the picture was just as ugly Highway 20 resembled a parking lot during the peak of rush hour and Transport Quebec was also recommending people stay home Even during the afternoon, icy roads were causing problems A section of Taschereau Blvd., between the Jacques Cartier Bridge and the exit for Highway 112, was closed for hours after a number of accidents On Highway 15 at Delson, a truck carrying a load of wood overturned, blocking southbound lanes for hours A bus failed to make the turn on Stephens Ave. in Verdun, skidding onto the sidewalk and blocking the intersection for hours Then a van rear-ended the bus In Dorval, Donald Richard borrowed a cell phone from a fellow commuter to call his boss after spending more than two hours in a traffic jam There were 125 accidents reported on highways around the island of Montreal by noon and the Sureté du Québec said that more than 200 cars had slid off roads ""They were mostly accidents with only minor damage All of the highways were a problem this morning,"" said SQ spokesman Constable Mathias Tellier On the South Shore, road conditions were so bad that by about 9 a.m., passengers on one bus that had already been stopped for about 40 minutes simply gave up With no idea how much longer the delay could last and only bad news about the road conditions ahead, the driver stopped along the shoulder of Highway 116 in Saint-Bruno and asked his 49 passengers what they wanted to do The driver, who didn't want to give his name, said: ""I asked them, 'Does anyone still want to go to Montreal?' They said: 'No, no, no' Everyone just wanted to go home"" Meanwhile, the Montreal South Shore Transit Corp., which serves seven South Shore suburbs closest to the island, including Brossard, Saint-Lambert and Longueuil, managed to keep all 278 of its rush-hour buses on the road yesterday morning, although there were many delays Timing a surprise MARK ABLEY The Gazette Weather forecasters for Environment Canada deny that they failed to predict yesterday's bout of freezing rain But the timing and amount of it did come as something of a surprise ""Freezing rain was expected,"" said meteorologist Bill Horrocks, ""But it was expected to be mixed with snow The unfortunate thing was that we did not get any snow ""When freezing rain falls on fairly dry asphalt at minus-6 or -7 degrees, it doesn't take long to turn into a skating rink"" At Dorval airport, where Environment Canada's measuring instruments are located, freezing rain began to fall yesterday at 6:25 a.m., just in time for the morning rush hour The freezing rain continued for more than six hours, becoming mixed with ice pellets It turned to rain when the temperature finally inched above zero As in last year's devastating ice storm, yesterday's freezing rain was a result of warm, wet air rising over the St. Lawrence valley and shedding moisture that dropped through a layer of bitterly cold, dry air flowing from the northeast The dry air solidified the rain into ice KEPT MOVING One critical difference, however, was that yesterday's warm air kept on moving A year ago, southern Quebec was a battleground for two air masses that had nowhere to go About 4 millimetres of freezing rain fell yesterday in the Montreal area - less than a fifth of the amount we suffered on the worst single day of the 1998 ice storm Even so, the amount was at the upper level of expectation Environment Canada's recorded message yesterday morning spoke of Montreal receiving 2 to 4 millimetres of freezing precipitation The South Shore, just like a year ago, was hit harder than the island Saint-Hubert endured 6 millimetres of freezing rain and ice pellets as well as a small amount of snow North of Montreal, Mirabel also experienced more than 5 millimetres of freezing precipitation EXPECTED DURING EVENING Environment Canada had mentioned the possibility of freezing rain in its Monday morning bulletin, 24 hours before the skies opened But at that stage, the agency was predicting snow or ice pellets during the day, with a risk of freezing rain on Tuesday evening A bulletin at 4 p.m. Monday warned of freezing rain as well as snow during the day As late as Monday evening, Environment Canada was anticipating that up to 5 centimetres of snow would mingle with the freezing rain CJAD meteorologist Ed Cowell had the timing a little better By yesterday afternoon, Cowell was predicting snow in the early morning, ice in the morning and freezing rain after that As for today, Horrocks said we'll find ourselves in a belt of milder air But then a cold front is expected to pass through In short, be prepared Peggy Curran's column returns Friday Hydro on alert, but system handles the job Hydro-Québec said yesterday's freezing rain wasn't enough to cause any damage to its power grid ""The system is working exemplarily,"" said Lucie Brodeur, a Hydro spokesman for the Montérégie ""It was a completely normal day"" She said crisis teams were on alert, but they were not needed south of Montreal, which suffered the worst during last January's ice storm ""They know our clients are nervous and need to be reassured,"" she said ""But at this level of freezing rain, I don't expect any damage"" Brodeur said only 15 millimetres of rain and freezing rain were expected yesterday About 2,700 downtown homes and businesses, including the Alexis Nihon Plaza, went dark at around 4:30 p.m. yesterday It took Hydro workers two to three hours to restore power to the area Hydro also had some trouble in the Rivière-des-Prairies area of Montreal yesterday afternoon, when 4,200 clients lost power But Hydro spokesman Claude Rocray said the outage had nothing to do with the freezing rain A piece of equipment that sent power on hydro lines from the Bourassa substation broke, but it wasn't weather-related, she added It happened just after noon, and the area had power back by 4 p.m. Environment Canada estimates that 5 millimetres of freezing rain can affect traffic, making roads slippery Crank that up to 10 millimetres, and people start falling down on sidewalks At 30 to 40 millimetres, there will be light damage to trees and branches And at 70 millimetres, there is the awful damage caused by downed trees and hydro wires Get 350 consecutive HOURS of FREE INTERNET ACCESS!

You really saw how fragile things were, and yet how people could come together and do remarkable things."" Farmer Dean Thomson in St Paul d'Abbotsford is still full of admiration for the hydro crews, from Quebec, the Maritimes and the northwestern United States who worked around the clock at minus 30 in the middle of the night Now, 10 years on, many people take pride in the idea our sense of community was tested, and proved to be hearty and inclusive Still, nobody wants to go through that again So 10 years later, we should be asking this: What if we had another ice storm, or similar crisis? Would we be ready this time? We should, 10 years along, be able to respond with a resounding Yes But we can't Take the most serious of all the problems from 1998, the near-catastrophe of running out of drinking water At the time, power for the production of tap water was not among Hydro-Quebec's top priorities It came in the second tier But after the storm, drinking water became the leader among Hydro-Quebec's top priorities, Montreal's director of drinkable water production told the Journal de Montreal But there's still no secure independent source of power for the city's two main water filtration facilities, Atwater and Desbaillets Rolls-Royce, with the help of the provincial government, built a 50-megawatt electricity generator designed to supply electricity to the filtration plants But that generator is still not independently capable of powering the two plants The city insists the situation will be corrected as soon as underground electrical cables are laid - in 2010 This isn't good enough It is a shock the most serious of the problems that came to light in the ice storm is still not completely corrected Across the province, it also became clear municipalities of all sizes were woefully unprepared to deal with a major disruption, never mind a full-blown crisis Too many towns and cities were found to have no emergency plan at all As a result, in 2001 the Quebec government ordered municipalities to draw up emergency plans capable of coping with disasters It was a popular move The government that issues such an order looks as though it is really taking charge But Quebec provided no money for preparing such plans This kind of ""unfunded mandate"" is not always quickly and fully obeyed by hard-pressed cities, to put it mildly The result? One in five Quebec municipalities still has no master emergency plan in place With or without funding, after 10 years this is irresponsible We should be able, on this 10th anniversary of the country's worst natural disaster, to look back secure in the knowledge that everything has been done to make sure we are safer than we were then But we can't and there is no excuse for this resident Lillian Bradley Foster, who spent the ice storm looking out for the elderly, says: ""I would like to think that the whole city is a little bit more aware that people live in isolation. But have we really moved ahead great leaps and bounds?"" GAZETTE the crisis was over, the memory with citizens was very positive Leclerc and Parker can't help seeing parallels between the way Montrealers reacted during the ice storm and during the shooting rampage at Dawson College last year, when students found sanctuary in nearby shops, Concordia University opened its doors and a women's shelter made sandwiches ""Whenever there is a crisis like that, Montrealers help everybody That's the bottom line,"" Parker said ""I think the people who lived through it were the wiser For that little time, you forgot all your other problems You had this thing to worry about, and the family And I think it really did bring everybody closer ""Everyone should go through something like that once in their life,"" said Robert Lortie, 55, who retired last month as chief of operations at Concordia University's Sir George Williams campus Ten years ago, he was co-ordinator at Loyola when the ice storm toppled trees and blacked out the west-end campus for two weeks ""It's the best experience I had at Concordia,"" Lortie said ""That's when you learn the capacity and the imagination of your employees - how far they can go and how dedicated they are, who has the big Concordia sign on his chest It was really a very good experience, something that changes you forever Ten years on, there's little evidence Thomson's Orchards in St Paul d'Abbotsford suffered any lasting damage from the ice storm About five per cent of Thomson's 30,000 trees were completely destroyed, while thousands more young trees required radical pruning and restructuring, which set crop production back for two or three years Today, the farm Dean Thomson's great-grandfather founded shortly after the First World War has expanded dramatically, with more than 100,000 trees growing 15 varieties of apples on 200 acres Still, it doesn't take much to jog Thomson's memory, whether it's the click-click of freezing rain hitting the window on a dreary morning or a glimpse at the mounds of dead maples rotting in the glen at the bottom of their property ""There were so many that in the spring after the storm, we went to try and clean it up, but it was impossible I don't even go down there anymore, it's too depressing It used to be this bucolic spot where you could ski under the trees Now it's just a bunch of old sticks ""Yes, it will come back, but not in my time Maybe in 60 years Right now, it just looks as if something has been demolished It's like losing old friends It was someplace that was special, and now it's not Yet he retains some remarkably positive memories of those 3 weeks when the whole family bunked together in his parents' three-bedroom house, waiting for Hydro-Quebec to rebuild the South Shore grid ""It made you realize how the life we lead is way too fast"" He credits Hydro crews, aided by reinforcements from the Maritimes and the northeastern United States, with getting the job done in the bitter cold that descended almost as soon as the rain stopped ""It was midnight and minus 20 Celsius, minus 30 with the wind chill, and this hydro team from New Brunswick was working around the clock You would hear people complaining about people being paid triple time, but I figure anyone who was out there at minus 30 in the middle of the night restoring electricity deserved what they got"" Barry and Ora Beloff now have three children - Samantha, 9, Brooke, 8, and Spencer, 5 - to show for the Jan 18 wedding they once feared would be hijacked by the ice storm, the blackout and 100 strangers who had been camping at the synagogue ""I'm an emotional guy to begin with, but I remember walking down the aisle, being more emotional than usual, thinking, 'We got through this.' You heard of people dying or having to go to the hospital I remember feeling very blessed It was a very spiritual night"" At 3 a.m. that morning, when the guests had gone home, the newlyweds stopped at the Westmount Lookout where Beloff had proposed two months earlier ""We were just looking at the city and this magnificent vast beauty of lights and ice and saying look what we've been through in 60 days and it sort of worked out pretty well"" Russ Williams spent 15 years as a member of the National Assembly for the West Island constituency of Nelligan, where he racked up fairly embarrassing majorities, even for a West Island Liberal Still, Williams never felt the love quite as intensely as he did during the ice storm, when he went glad-handing with a portable generator, a six-pack and a bag of potato chips ""I felt like Santa Claus going around giving everyone juice,"" Williams says of those days and nights he and neighbour Len McDougall spent spreading joy - but mostly heat - to folks in Beaconsfield and beyond Ten days later, when the worst was over for Montreal, McDougall shipped his generator off to a family friend in St Jean sur Richelieu, where power wouldn't be back up for a few more weeks Williams, now president of an agency that represents research-intensive pharmaceutical companies, still has his generator stored in his Ottawa garage ""I turn it on every month or so, just to make sure it still works in case I ever need it again"" He likes to think he launched his neighbourhood patrol not because he was a politician but because he could ""There was this sense of vulnerability, that the situation was out of your control The ice storm really showed us the power of Mother Nature and who was really in charge"" But that was later, something we were going to have to discover for ourselves, the hard way pcurranthegazette, canwest, com MONTREAL DIARY Time for romance After the stress of the holidays - and the resultant breakups - January is a busy month for the Misty River matchmaking service Page B2 montrealgazette, com JANUARY 1998: DAYS OF DARKNESS Watch newscasts from the ice storm Download The Gazette from Jan 5-12, 1998 View reader photo galleries and videos and read stories about how fellow Montrealers fared Share your memories of that icy week Catch up on the series as it unfolds Part 1 of a nine-day series THE GAZETTE 1998 The Biosphere on Île Ste Helene As the storm intensified, the ice wrapped branches and wires in a sheath of ice THE ICE STORM TIPTOES IN Story by PEGGY CURRAN The Gazette DAY 1, MONDAY, JAN 5, 1998 Montrealers wake up to the annoying tap-tap-tap of ice pellets slapping the windowpane Rush-hour traffic this first morning after the long Christmas-New Year's break is treacherous Bridges are congested and harried motorists are having trouble keeping the steady build-up of ice off the windshield Planes are delayed for de-icing and sections of Highway 15 close briefly when a truck jackknifes ""There's a lot of creative driving out there - a guy behind me was scraping his windshield as he was driving,"" says CBC Radio traffic reporter Dave Rosen He describes road conditions as ""bloody awful"" Downtown, on Sherbrooke and Ste Catherine Sts, cars slide and pedestrians inch along the crust of ice that now coats the lumpy mounds of snow that haven't been picked up after a snowstorm on Dec 30 Crews are sanding and salting, but the city has no plans for a major clean-up ""Most of the snow from the last storm has melted and road and sidewalk conditions, generally are good,"" says city official Pierre Bonin Taxi-driver Jafr Khazaii disagrees ""It's so slippery it's bad for business People don't want to go outside"" Montreal police constable Andre Leclerc, walking the downtown beat, recalled sidewalks hadn't been cleared and cars couldn’t park ""It was like cross-country skiing"" Still, nothing so special about that, says his former partner John Parker ""Next thing you are going to tell me you never saw anyone from public works, but you don't see them all winter anyhow"" Besides, over the years, he and Leclerc had perfected what Parker calls the Montreal shuffle ""We don't pick our feet up We shuffle along because if you pick them up, you are going to fall"" By afternoon, just over a centimetre of rain had fallen, with Environment Canada calling for more freezing rain and drizzle Parker, who lives on the West Island, dismissed the morning weather reports on the radio as the usual alarmist hype to keep listeners tuned in ""I'm thinking, 'What are they yelling about?' There's nothing there, you just scrape the stuff off the car"" High above Peel St, on the 20th floor of the Marriott Residence Hotel, Barry Beloff and his fiancée, Ora, weren't giving the weather a whole lot of thought ""It didn't seem to be anything more than we were used to as Montrealers It just seemed like it was cold and it was icy and it was raining and snowing,"" Beloff said In the midst of planning a wedding for 330 people, with guests coming in from across Canada, the United States, Europe and the Middle East, they had their hands full with fittings and caterers and menu plans ""You are kind of floating in a cloud You're not really living a real life You are living in this bubble where you have to get this thing done for Jan 18"" ""I remember when it started to rain thinking how beautiful it was,"" said Jason Hughes, then coordinator at the N.G. Community Council at the corner of Cavendish Blvd and Somerled Ave ""You recognize that it's difficult for people to get around and it's slippery and it's dangerous But I was 10 years younger and it didn't bother me at all, I was just sort of trudging through"" But as night fell, the rain continued, wrapping branches and strangling high-tension wires with a thick sheath of ice Joan Foster, head nurse for home care at the CLSC in Notre Dame de Grace-Montreal West, was in Lachine, offering a course to prospective Brownie leaders ""Driving home, I thought this is insane Only Girl Guides would

storm makes the storyteller's eyes fill with tears The then 54-year-old Hydro-Quebec president clad in a dark suit coat and turtleneck with the public utility's ""Q"" and thunderbolt on the collar, became an enduring image of Quebec's biggest natural disaster Seated next to Premier Lucien Bouchard at daily news conferences, the two men were the face of the rescue work The ice storm started on Monday, Jan 5, 1998 It dragged on for weeks, and at one point there were 1.4 million households, businesses and institutions without power in Quebec, leaving millions of people in the dark Day after day, Caille's uniform seemed to convey protection and strength, like a father rushing from home to an emergency wearing an incongruous combination of clothes Its unfussiness conveyed solidarity with electricity-deprived Quebecers and with those who worked for the Q and thunderbolt ""They didn't know me at all before,"" he says today of the public ""After, they all knew me"" He's kept the turtlenecks, he says over coffee ""But he hasn't touched them since"" ""I can't put them on,"" he says, his voice breaking off, when he's pressed to explain why ""It's too hard,"" he adds in a near whisper ""There's something that's changed inside of me, that I don't even recognize I become emotional sometimes I guess I haven't taken it all in"" When it was all over, he tucked away 10 turtlenecks, minus one, in a drawer at home The one went to a man he didn't know It was a couple of weeks into the crisis and the power was back at his Outremont home so he was back sleeping there Caille was being driven to work when he heard his name being called by someone on a city bus that was stopped next to his car at a red light The man on the bus who was calling his name was pointing at something He wanted the shirt Caille climbed out of his car and motioned to the bus driver to let him on He pulled his turtleneck off in the middle of the bus aisle and held it out The shocked man uttered ""Thanks"" Two weeks later, the man wrote a letter to Caille vowing to keep the shirt forever Caille first donned the turtleneck on the rainy afternoon of Jan 6, 1998 He had just returned in haste from Paris, where he had delivered a speech the day before He asked his driver to take him directly from the airport to the Hydro-Quebec office in St Hyacinthe A Radio-Canada news crew soon showed up there asking for an interview outside Caille had on a suit and tie and a trench coat, appropriate for the weather in Paris Someone at the Hydro-Quebec office scrounged up a turtleneck and jacket so he could go outside A lot of memories are bundled up with those shirts He can recall nearly every minute of each day of the crisis He usually slept on a couch in his office, or in the car At 8 a.m., Caille's inner circle would meet in his office for an hour, including Marie-Josee Nadeau, who was responsible for communications and his right arm, Hydro-Quebec assistant director general Yves Fillion, who was supervising operations on the ground in Montreal and on the South Shore After that, he usually visited line workers and other Hydro workers on the job to try to help keep everyone motivated Some pylons were built three times because one would be built, then topple Then it was back to the office to supervise Shortly before 4 p.m., his inner circle met again in his office to recap what was new that day At 4 p.m., he'd take the stairs from his office on the 21st floor to the 11th floor to the premier's office to meet with Bouchard At 5 p.m., they descended to the main floor for their daily news conference After that it was back to meet workers and electricity-deprived farmers ""We were trying to show we weren't crushed, and that we were still alive,"" Caille says The constant fear for Bouchard and him was that people would die In fact, Caille felt tremendous remorse when a Videotron worker was killed and then when a Hydro worker lost his legs in an accident Caille says he became more protective of his family after the ice storm ""I see things in a different way Public safety is fragile"" He knows he's more emotional sometimes, but he hasn't found the answers to identify what's changed in him That's in a drawer at home PIERRE OBENDRAUF THE GAZETTE 1998 Ice storm news conference: Hydro-Quebec's Andre Caille talks to reporters with Premier Lucien Bouchard at his side ""We're in a state of alert There are some blackouts and we have to follow things carefully,"" Pierre Millette, Hydro-Quebec spokesperson Anatomy of an ice storm Starting Jan 5, 1998, a week-long ice storm gripped Quebec and eastern Ontario The storm toppled hydro pylons and caused widespread power outages It was intense both in the amount of rain it dropped and its endurance

will occur Trying to predict the future is always a dicey undertaking, if only because while you may think you know what's going to happen, you never actually know until it does For example, waking up at 5 a.m. yesterday, you probably would have thought most of the Western world's brain cells would be sparking over whether the United States is on the threshold of electing its first black president An hour later, a look at the news websites would have suggested the bigger, closer-to-home question was whether gas prices would break the $1.30 per litre mark Thirty minutes after that, however, it would have become clear that even though who leads the most powerful nation on Earth and how much we'll pay for the lifeblood that runs most of the planet are matters of concern, all anyone would be talking about was whether Britney Spears had finally gone around a bend that was way past anything resembling a rehab clinic Nor are the problems created by the volatility of a 21st-century news day unique to professional news analysts On Boxing Day, I asked readers for their expectations and predictions for 2008 One of the more notable I received dealt with Britney Spears and was provided by Norm Spears (who pointed out he is no relation) ""Probably the biggest story of 2008,"" JAMES MENNIE on readers' forecasts ""While things may not get better this year, they'll become infinitely worse if we don't take a more active role,"" Spears wrote, ""will be the emergence of Britney Spears as a candidate for the office of the president of the United States under the banner of her New Prohibition Party with her running mate Paris Hilton"" Joe Soul felt readjusting Quebec's electoral map to give more power to urban rather than rural voters was part of the key to ""Quebec's real growth and progress"" Terry Pearson summed up the next 12 months of federal (or, for that matter, provincial) politics by observing: ""There won't be an election, because the Liberals won't be ready for one"" Simon Karpat said he was unable to predict specifically what challenges we'd face in 2008, so his view of the next 12 months was broad: ""Certainly, Afghanistan and now Pakistan, climate change, infrastructure and fuel costs will figure prominently"" Karpat's suggestion on how we can help meet those challenges was crystal clear, however ""I propose that all who are eligible actually exercise their constitutional right to vote! Perhaps if more of us took a more active role in how our representatives become elected, we would be a little more concerned about how they governed"" Peter Howlett, founding president of Les Amis de la montagne, suggested eight ways Mount Royal could be better enjoyed and protected in 2008 They included improved co-ordination among the two municipalities and four Montreal boroughs that share the mountain's 10 square kilometres of protected territory, preservation and maintenance of the heritage properties on Mount Royal, and making the site more accessible to pedestrians and bicyclists Yvon Lebrun's predictions included a Conservative loss (but no Liberal majority) in a federal election fought on the issues of the environment and the war in Afghanistan He also sees more mergers in the forestry industry, oil hitting $200 a barrel and a terrorist attack occurring ""at the least expected event in Canada"" Elspeth Dowell, attributing her ""psychic"" abilities to nothing more than educated guesses based on observation, foresaw a transit strike and a major snowstorm ""followed by freezing rain"" next month While she doesn't expect more overpasses to collapse this year, she does reckon ""there will be a couple of bad car accidents due to warped and sunken road surfaces"" William Bullett called to predict not one but two transit fare hikes in 2008 ""And I see the unions giving Mayor (Gerald) Tremblay a lot of problems this year"" Another reader was even less optimistic ""I'll bet you that (2008) will turn out the same way 2007 did,"" he noted in a voice message, ""We're all getting rammed up the wazoo by the city They want more and they're not doing anything We should get rid of all these little boroughs of Montreal and turn them back into (demerged) cities"" If there was a thread of consensus that ran through all your replies, it was that while things may not get better this year, they'll become infinitely worse if we don't take a more active role in charting our destiny There's something to be said for that point of view, if only because in the end, no one really knows how things will turn out Unless, of course, you bet money on Britney's having another meltdown jmennie thegazette, canwest, com Unwanted car gets hook The abandoned Saab 900S of Park Ave has been relocated, but it still appears to be orphaned Until yesterday, the car had sat for about a week on the busy thoroughfare next to Mount Royal Park without being ticketed or towed, despite the fact it was parked in a lane reserved for city buses - a no-parking, no-stopping zone - and even after snow-clearing crews plowed around it Wednesday evening According to the city of Montreal's towing information website, the car was moved just after midnight Thursday and deposited less than a kilometre south It now sits on Park Ave, near Prince Arthur St, with a $92 ticket under its windshield wiper $42 for the parking infraction and $50 for towing It's parked in front of an unpaid parking meter, and is still mostly covered in snow City officials said they didn't tow it during snow removal Wednesday night because no warning signs had been posted, as the Plateau Mont Royal borough decided at the last moment to clear the snow A sign was posted Wednesday night giving the driver 24 hours to move the car He or she did not Police said checks of the licence plate show the car has no history of ticket offences, nor has it been reported stolen The city's towing information website is http://servicesenligne2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/inforemorquage LASALLE COLLEGE ""An exemplary Choose your Fashion Fashion Design Apparel Production Management Fashion Marketing Social Hotel Management Computer Science Data Management Food Service Management Network Management International Studies Special Care Counselling Techniques Early Childhood Education Techniques Tourism International Management Accounting & Management Business Management Transportation Logistics Day or evening classes in French or in English Registration in progress!

Up to 100,000 Kenyans face starvation in western Kenya because of election-related tribal violence, the World Food Program warned yesterday, as rivals in last week's disputed presidential vote showed no willingness to talk President Mwai Kibaki and opposition candidate Raila Odinga, who had led through much of the vote-counting process, continued to put uncompromising positions: The opposition called for a new election and Kibaki agreed - but only if the courts ordered it Odinga already has described the courts as packed with Kibaki's cronies Many analysts and diplomats do not see the courts as a solution, partly because cases take so long to process Opposition claims of vote-rigging in the election triggered tribal violence that has killed about 300 people European Union observers said the vote failed to meet democratic standards Violence ebbed in Nairobi's slum districts and many areas across the country yesterday and only a few opposition demonstrators turned out to try to march to Nairobi for an opposition rally In the coastal city of Mombasa, police fired tear gas to disperse more than 1,000 protesters But opposition supporters remain angry over claims the election was rigged, and there is still a high level of tribal tension More than 180,000 Kenyans have fled their homes, the United Nations reported, and 500,000 will need aid in the coming month, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which launched a $15-million appeal yesterday The World Food Program plans to distribute food soon through the Red Cross, but 75 truckloads carrying 2,500 tonnes of food were stranded in Kenyan cities because of poor security in the countryside Armed gangs from different tribes have thrown up roadblocks, and only convoys with military protection can move freely Helping hand Canada will provide $1 million to aid victims of election-related violence in Kenya, it was announced yesterday The money will go to the Kenya Red Cross 'Blogger' in trenches keeps world informed NICK BRITTEN LONDON DAILY TELEGRAPH London -

A Kenyan Olympic runner who competed internationally for many years was among the victims of the country's post-poll violence when a mob stoned him to death this week, a friend said yesterday Lucas Sang, a middle-distance runner, had competed in the 1988 Seoul Olympics as part of Kenya's 4x400 metre relay quartet, and again in the 1992 games in Barcelona A close friend of Sang and also a former professional athlete, Martin Keino, said the runner was attacked on Tuesday night by a stone-throwing gang as he walked with a group of friends He died when a rock hit his head and the gang then burned his body ""One of the ways they recognized him was there was a piece of his tracksuit still not burnt on the leg,"" Keino said ""It's really sad He was very well known and popular"" Eldoret has seen the worst of ethnic clashes many Kenyans can scarcely believe are happening in their country, usually seen as a relatively stable nation in a turbulent region Much of the violence has targeted Kibaki's large, economically dominant Kikuyu ethnic group, especially in Eldoret and the Rift Valley region, where about 90 people have been killed and hundreds of homes burned Thousands of people have fled town and about 40,000 in the Rift Valley region are internally displaced, aid workers say Keino said the rioters mistook the athlete - who hails from the Kalenjin tribe whose youths have launched many of the attacks in Eldoret - for a Kikuyu PROTESTER TAKEN OUT INDIAN Chilean riot police officers detain a demonstrator during a rally outside of La Moneda Presidential Palace in Santiago yesterday The demonstration was held to protest against the death of Matias Catrileo Quezada, 22, a Mapuche Indian, who died on Thursday after being shot during clashes with the police in a land dispute in southern Chile ""It was at night, in the dark Tensions are high; They mistook him for someone else, I guess No one would have done this if they knew it was him He was so respected"" Lying about 2,000 metres above sea level on the western side of Kenya's fork of the Great Rift Valley Eldoret has produced a series of top athletes The most famous, Paul Tergat, held the world record for the marathon from 2003 to 2007, until he was beaten by arch-rival Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia Keino said Tergat was a friend of Sang, but he had not yet managed to contact him to tell him ""He'll be very disappointed, very sad,"" he said A funeral will be held in Eldoret today Keino said he hoped it would bring people together ""Hopefully, it's going to make people realize this violence has to stop"" Researchers caught in the chaos AARON ZECHERS WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Winnipeg -

Conflicting totals are products of measuring methods The city of Montreal and Environment Canada use different ways to estimate snowfall, That often leads to conflicting totals like those announced after Montreal's first two major storms, Montreal says the city gets an average of 231.5 centimetres of snow every year, while Environment Canada says it's 217.5 centimetres, Here is a look at the different snow-measuring methods: The city As city of Montreal workers hosed water onto a rink across the park, Michel Frenette unlocked a 3-metre-high chain-link gate topped with barbed wire, It protects one of the city's best-kept secrets, Inside is a contraption that resembles a large, old-fashioned milk can topped by an upside down bell, They are held in place by steel wires fastened to the ground; more wires and cables connect the device to a small concrete shed nearby The facility, in Rosemont's Lafond Park, is part of a little-known network city officials refer to as ""the Montreal Triangle"" - three snow-measuring stations the city has been running since 1978, The others are in Ahuntsic-Cartierville and Sud-Ouest boroughs, Montreal pays Enviromet International, a private company, $180,000 a year to measure snowfall at the stations, Each captures falling snow in a snow gauge containing antifreeze (to ensure snow melts instantly and to keep the liquid from freezing) and oil (to prevent liquid from evaporating), said Frenette, who works for the city department that coordinates centralized aspects of Montreal's snow-clearing operations, Atop the snow gauge sits a conical device that reduces wind turbulence that can affect the amount of snow captured, The snow gauges constantly measure the weight of the liquid, information is then sent to the nearby shed, where a computer calculates the snowfall. It uses a 10-to-1 ratio, figuring that 10 centimetres of snow typically melts down to one centimetre of water, Using a telephone line, the computer relays the snow data to Enviromet, where the average from the three stations is calculated, It sends reports to the city every six hours, Most Montrealers haven't heard of the snow stations because the data is usually not for public consumption, though the city this month started using its internal snow totals (which are typically higher than Environment Canada's) to justify delays in snow clearing, Snow is typically lighter and less dense (contains less water for a given volume) when the weather is warm, said Jessica Cox, a Ph.D. student who completed a master's degree on measuring snow density, at McGill's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, The reason? ""The crystals tend to stick together as they're falling and they look like fog isn't much CHICAGO - Dense fog and clouds forced O'Hare International Airport to cancel 100 flights yesterday, the busiest travel day of the year, ""When there's a delay at Chicago, there's going to be a ripple effect throughout the entire nation,"" said Laura Brown, a spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration, in an interview, ""Even if you're having great weather where needed,"" Rousseau said, ""The rain and ice won't stop Montreal's current round of snow-clearing, city spokesperson Andre Lazure said, It ""should be pretty well finished"" by tomorrow, ""In case of ice, he said, some PIERRE OBENDRAUF THE GAZETTE Michel Frenette in Rosemont borough, at one of the city's three snow-measuring stations, Normally the data is used only to give the city an idea of how long it might take to clean up and to calculate how much it must pay private companies for the snow-clearing work they do, Until 1978, the city relied on Environment Canada data gathered at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, The new system was put in place after private contractors complained snowfalls at the airport weren't representative of what they see on city streets, Frenette said, Most of the work is automated but a human observer is stationed at the Ahuntsic station 24/7 during the winter to monitor precipitation types, ""That's important because private clearers are paid for snow and ice pellet accumulation - not for rain and freezing rain,"" The city does not use the data from its stations to determine when to dispatch trucks to clear form these great big snowflakes,"" she said, ""If you imagine a starlike snowflake, there's so much empty space and that's what is making it so light"" Snow is typically heavier and more dense when it's colder ""because of the shape the crystals form in, If they form into hexagons or needles, those can basically be packed in together much tighter there are fewer air pockets, better than snow you are, if there's a delay at one of our major hubs, it's going to create problems throughout the rest of the system,"" New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport were experiencing delays as long as two hours for flights departing to Chicago, the agency said, BLOOMBERG NEWS blue-collar workers would be moved from snow-clearing duties to spread abrasives to provide pedestrians and drivers with some traction, Although many roads and sidewalks remain encumbered by the 40 centimetres of snow city streets and sidewalks, For that, ""people arrive at the boroughs and they take a ruler and they say: Ah, we have 2.5 centimetres - we're going out"" Environment Canada Yes, whenever it snows, someone wanders around a fenced-in enclosure at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport sticking a ruler into the snow, But Environment Canada also relies on an automated instrument to help it determine how much snow has fallen, The data are gathered by weather observers, on site 24 hours a day, They work for Nav Canada, a private company that also provides air traffic control at Canadian airports, Environment Canada oversees the operation and calibrates the instruments, For ruler measurements, observers walk around a 30-metre-by-30-metre enclosure sticking a ruler in the snow at several spaces, ""As if things weren't complicated enough, at times, the opposite is true - warm-weather snow is heavier because liquid water droplets attach to snowflakes,"" Cox explained, Snowflake types also affect how snow settles on the ground, Because of its weight more intense or deeper snowfalls compact more quickly that blanketed the city a week ago, snowbank-clearing equipment bites through iced-up, water-logged snow just as quickly as through the regular stuff, Lazure explained, He spoke after Mercier Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Cote des Neiges-Notre Dame de Grace and Plateau Mont Royal emerged as the biggest losers to date in the city's snow-clearing efforts, The thoroughfares in those boroughs had been half-cleared of snow - 50 per cent, 52 per cent and 53 per cent respectively - by 11 a.m. yesterday official city figures show, The daily data snapshot only provided percentage-completion figures for 11 of the 19 boroughs, The other eight ""didn't fill them in,"" Lazure said, Far ahead of the pack was the Bizard-Ste. Genevieve borough, in the west, with snow-clearing spots, and clearing the snow every six hours, Its automated instrument is similar to the city of Montreal's technology - it melts snow as it falls, then calculates how much water is produced, The automated and human measurements are both considered, with the observer making a judgment call about which measurement to give more weight to, On very windy days, the ruler measurements are less reliable because snow blows around, On those days, more weight is given to water-content measurements, Another automated instrument is currently being tested at the airport It sends an ultrasonic pulse towards the ground and measures the amount of time it takes to bounce back, As snow accumulates under it, the machine can determine its depth, That can make a difference when measuring with a ruler ""The properties of a snowfall change rapidly,"" Cox said, ""If you were to measure snow on the ground every hour for 12 hours straight you would get a different snow depth than if you just measured once a day,"" ariga thegazette, canwest, com shown as 95 per cent completed, St. Leonard was running 80 per cent complete, with operations expected to wrap up today Remember last Christmas?

The reptiles included rattlesnakes, cobras, mambas, African vipers and tiger snakes. Besides being used as guards or to intimidate customers, snakes have also been used as objects for smuggling drugs, being force-fed packets of drugs and later sacrificed to retrieve the goods.

Children all over town are impatiently asking when it will be time to make snowmen, when it will be time to go tobogganing, and when Santa Claus will finally arrive. Adults have other kinds of questions. Do we have enough flashlights and candles in the cupboards? Does the car have its snow tires and antifreeze? And just what does ""sleet"" mean, anyway? Today, we bring you a user's guide to bad weather everything you wanted to know about Montreal winters, but were afraid to ask. We hope it helps you understand those ominous weather forecasts in the dark months ahead. FREEZING RAIN Unpleasant stuff. It usually falls when a cold mass of air has filled the basin that Montreal occupies. A warm front approaches, but can't flush the cold air out of the valley. Rain begins to drop through the dome of chilly air. But because the objects on the surface are colder than the air, the rain freezes as it hits the ground or you and me. ICE PELLETS Even nastier. Ice pellets fall when a thick dome of cold air (often at minus-2 or -3 Celsius) hangs over Montreal. An approaching warm front sends rain down through the dome but as the rain falls, it freezes in mid-air. How do the weather forecasters decide when to predict freezing rain and when to call for ice pellets? ""Judgment and experience,"" according to Environment Canada's Richard Fournier. ICE FOG Beautiful, scary and rare around Montreal. To form, ice fog needs an air temperature of minus-25 C or colder. It also requires an open body of water. When a wind blows damp air off the water, the moisture evaporates and crystallizes into fog. SNOW FLURRIES We've had them already, we'll have them again soon. Flurries are predicted when the weathermen are looking for ""no significant accumulation of snow."" But as soon as snow is expected to cover the ground, the term ""flurries"" is replaced by ""snow."" SNOW Even in summer, precipitation forms as snow at high altitudes. But until the arrival of winter, those snow crystals melt into rain as they drop through warmer air. In winter, when the air temperature is below freezing all the way to ground level, we get snow. BLOWING SNOW Best advice: avoid it. The weather office calls for blowing-snow conditions when the winds have reached at least 40 kilometres an hour, when visibility is 1 km or less, and when these factors are likely to persist for six hours or more. The secret of ROD CURRIE CANADIAN PRESS TORONTO Ever wonder if your toddler terror of the keyboard might be another Glenn Gould? Or your virtuoso of the crayon set, blithely redecorating the walls, another Emily Carr? Don't worry. If you've got a budding genius or child prodigy another Mozart or Margaret Laurence they'll let you know. As English poet Owen Meredith put it: ""Genius does what it must, and talent does what it can."" Blowing snow is more severe in rural areas than in the city. BLIZZARDS Loosely, we use the word ""blizzard"" to describe any old snowstorm. But the weathermen have a more specific usage. For them, a blizzard occurs when blowing-snow conditions are accompanied by intense cold a wind-chill factor of 1875 watts per square metre. That's the equivalent of minus-40 C. Montreal gets such a pure and dur blizzard less than once a year. SNOWSTORMS They come at us from two main directions: the Canadian West and the U.S. East Coast. Western storms usually bring dry snow; coastal storms give us wet snow, excellent for making snowmen. But those wet storms are often followed by a spell of very cold weather, as the wind systems shift around. A third, less important source of our storms is the Mississippi-Ohio Valley. These tend to be not so dry as the prairie storms, nor so wet as the Atlantic ones. Luckily, it's exceptional for Montreal to endure a cold-weather system out of Hudson Bay. MISCELLANEOUS STUFF Why does it never hail in winter? Because hail is born of warm air. Hail falls, mostly in summer, when droplets of moisture solidify into stones that are too heavy to stay aloft. For this to happen, the genius: a rare what it can. In the view of Canadian arts experts and teachers, true genius will not be denied, but talent must often be discovered. Sometimes the clues are elusive. Nicholas Goldschmidt, long a prominent figure in Canadian music, used to tell students: ""If you haven't got it, you've had it."" Genius is a rare combination of heart, head and hand, says Goldschmidt, the Vienna-born first director of the Canadian Opera Company. ""Wunderkind"" is the German word for it wonder child, like moisture must be lifted high up into belts of freezing air. Updrafts of up to 6,000 feet a minute have been recorded. Why do the worst storms seem to come in December and March? Because those are the months when a belt of Arctic air is most likely to meet up with a belt of warmer air from the south. The clash of systems can bring heavy snow. In January and February, by contrast, Montreal usually lies well inside a zone of cold air. What is sleet? That's a tricky question. Environment Canada doesn't like the term, because it can mean different things to different people. The commonest meaning of sleet is a mixture of snow, rain and freezing rain. But it can also refer (in the United States, especially) to the thin coat of ice that forms when rain freezes on cold surfaces; and in Britain, it can mean wet snow. How much snow do we get in an average winter? The average amount, between 1961 and 1990, was 214.4 centimetres. Are winters getting longer? No if anything, they're getting shorter. But Environment Canada is wary of making definitive pronouncements about the climate. Still, it's noticeable that the last seven winters have all produced less than 214.4 cm of snow. In the driest winter on record (1979-80), we received a mere 93.1 cm. Last winter's total (206.3 cm) was boosted by a depressingly large amount of snow in April. combination Gould,"" he says of the pianist who made his Toronto Symphony debut at 15. Then there was Mozart, the most astonishing prodigy of them all, composing at age 5. The late Harold Town, outrageous multi-talented bad boy of Canadian art, drew on the walls and the kitchen table. ""It was a part of me as much as my blond hair,"" he's quoted as saying in a recent book on his life. Laurence, who gave the world The Stone Angel and A Jest of God, started writing in Grade 2. Whether rain, weather office ""Every storm is different,"" Martin Bartczak was saying. ""We look forward to a good storm it adds excitement to the office. It gets our adrenaline flowing."" Bartczak is one of 13 employees (all of them men) at the Dorval Weather Office of Environment Canada. Someone is on duty there, day and night, to give weather information to radio stations, farmers, vacationers, fishermen, film crews and the public at large. To reach the weather office, you take the elevator to the fourth floor of Dorval airport's main terminal building. Its plate-glass windows look north, over the runways toward the distant Laurentians. Although the forecasts reach us from Dorval, Montreal-area forecasters work out of a building in St. Laurent. They transmit their predictions to the Dorval weather office, whose employees adapt and pass them on to us. Environment Canada also maintains more than 50 weather-observing stations around Quebec. Because of automation, the number is decreasing. A few months ago, the station at Ste. Agathe was closed as a cost-cutting measure. Bartczak and his colleagues are experts at explaining the vagaries of local weather. Their job is to adapt the raw data of the sky to the needs of each client. ""It can happen,"" of heart, head ""It wasn't a hobby,"" she once recalled, ""but a vocation."" Still, nature can play dirty tricks, with mere panache or the cavalier flourish masquerading as genius. A would-be Karen Kain may have all the ballet attributes at 9 but suddenly develop a dumpy figure. Candidates may have talent, bone structure, intelligence and style, said Carole Chadwick who conducts the annual cross-country auditions for the National Ballet School. But they won't make it if they don't have the royal jelly of ""the natural storm or snow is on the job he remarked, ""that we'll have rain here in Dorval, freezing rain in Laval and snow in Ste. Therese. ""Or it might be 2 degrees at Dorval and minus-2 at Mirabel. That's a bad place for an airport, eh? In the dip just before the Laurentians begin, you get lots of fog and freezing rain."" The employees at the weather office are approaching one of their busiest times of year. April and October are their quietest months: little snow, and no agricultural forecasts. Rush-hours for weathermen come in summer and winter. The pre-recorded local forecasts attract about 12,000 calls a day not counting people who give up because the line is busy. When a storm is coming, up to 15,000 calls a day are received. Our biggest-ever snowstorm dumped 43.2 cm of snow on March 4, 1971. In the Dorval office, that day is remembered fondly- ""I was working here, plotting maps,"" said Richard Fournier.

ROOFTOP DEMO By noon yesterday, police had made their first arrests, five women who had climbed to a rooftop and unfurled a banner reading ""Bush and big biz agree that people with AIDS drop dead."" They were charged with trespassing and reckless endangerment. A handful of other demonstrators were arrested for defacing a Starbucks coffee shop with graffiti and scratching the window of a Gap clothing store. At the Gap outlet on Fifth Ave, 600 union activists led by the AFL-CIO protested against the clothing chain's alleged sweatshop practices in Guatemala and other developing countries. A wall of 30 cops stood single file across the storefront. Inside, a few shoppers checked out blue jeans. Protest organizations promise that the weekend will bring bigger demonstrations. Extra train coaches added STORM Continued from Page A1 It reached Toronto overnight Wednesday, creating havoc on city roads and upsetting travel plans as the snow changed to ice pellets and freezing rain yesterday afternoon. With dozens of flights in and out of Toronto cancelled yesterday, Via Rail laid on extra staff and cars to accommodate passengers traveling between Ontario and Quebec yesterday and today. All afternoon and evening trains from Toronto to Montreal and Ottawa were sold out by early afternoon, said Catherine Kaloutsky, a spokesman at Via's offices in Toronto. The storm also disrupted air traffic in and out of Dorval airport yesterday, Aeroports de Montreal spokesman Jacqueline Richard said. ""There were 26 or 27 cancellations on flights from Toronto, Boston, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia,"" she said. In addition, some flight departures from Dorval were delayed ""because of aircraft not coming in or being late."" Transport Quebec road crews were on alert yesterday as the storm slowly moved into the area. Planning to travel? For information on Via arrivals and departures today, check the Web site at www.viarail.ca. For information on flights at Dorval and Mirabel airports, consult www.admtl.com. ""The salt trucks are out and they will be employed as needed,"" Yves Kirouac, a Transport Quebec technician, said yesterday. ""It’s not a storm that will take us by surprise - it’s just a little late. We ask people to drive carefully, especially as it’s the first storm of the season."" While winter’s first blast took a long time coming, Montrealers had to wait even longer for their first real snowfall in the winter of 1979-80, Lam of Environment Canada said. The first big snowstorm of that season dumped 20 centimetres on the city - on March 14. ""That was also the season with the least snow on record,"" Lam noted. Only 93.1 centimetres of snow fell on Montreal that year, down from an average of 228.4 centimetres.

The 25-year-old from Beaconsfield, who returned to the court with the Martlets only a few weeks ago after a three-year sabbatical, is the Canadian Interuniversity Sports female athlete of the week. The 6-foot-1 middle blocker was MVP at the Ottawa Gee-Gees Invitational last weekend, with 79 digs, 68 kills, 16 stuff blocks, five aces and a 2.34 passing ratio (out of 3.0) in five matches to lead McGill to the tournament title. In league play, Whelan's performance, as well as that of other veterans like fifth-year setter Shauna Forster, along with middle-blocker Elizabeth Jamieson and power-hitter Joliane Allaire, both fourth-year players, has the Martlets in a tight end-of-season battle for first place with Université de Montreal and Laval. ""What Wendy brings to the team in terms of performance on the court, experience and the maturity she gained during the three years she was away has been invaluable,"" said Rachele Beliveau, now in her 11th season as head coach of the Martlets. ""Her presence has brought a lot of stability and more confidence to the team."" Whelan played at McGill from 1995 to 1998, was a three-time Academic and CIS All-Canadian and graduated with a degree in physical and occupational therapy. Whelan, who is back at McGill as a special student studying psychology, French and computer technology, spent 18 months as a member of Canada's national team after graduating and went on to play professionally in Austria. COMPLIMENTS OTHERS ""Wendy really compliments others on the team,"" Beliveau said. ""Shauna, Elizabeth and Joliane have also gained in experience and demonstrate a lot of maturity on the court. The four are players who can make the difference between winning by two points and losing by two points."" The Martlets, tied with U de M and Laval with identical 6-5 league records, are ranked seventh in the country. They entertain U de M tonight and fifth-ranked Laval on Sunday. HAPPY 125TH: McGill, the oldest organized hockey team in the world, marked its 125th anniversary yesterday. ""How do we know we’re the oldest? Because there is no evidence of the existence of a hockey 'team' before McGill started playing,"" said Earl (The Pearl) Zukerman, sports information director at McGill and vice-president of the Society For International Hockey Research. ""People may have played hockey at the time, but McGill had the first organized team,"" Zukerman said. McGill students, instrumental in the origins and development of the game, founded the world's first hockey club, according to an article that appeared in the McGill University Gazette on Feb. 1, 1877. The first game was a challenge between McGill and the Victorias, a team composed of members from Montreal's old Victoria Skating Rink, the Montreal Lacrosse Club and the Montreal Football Club. McGill won 2-1 in a game played at Victoria Rink in the heart of the city in an area bordered by Drummond St., de Maisonneuve Blvd. and Rene Levesque Blvd. (formerly Dorchester). A Tilden car-rental franchise now occupies the site. The game between McGill and the Victorias was played in accordance with a list of rules published the following month in The Gazette, on Feb. 27, 1877, and before another confrontation between the teams in early March. The list of rules included: The ball may be stopped, but not carried on by any part of the body. No player shall raise his stick above his shoulder. Charging from behind, tripping, collaring, kicking or shinning shall not be allowed. All disputes shall be settled by the umpires, or in the event of their disagreement, by the referee. Zukerman said the game was initially played with a hard rubber ball, but took on a puck-like, yet square shape, when an enterprising McGill student cut off the rounded sides of the ball. To mark the anniversary, McGill will play host to Queen's University tonight at 7:30 in a continuation of the second-oldest men's college hockey rivalry in North America. McGill and Queen's first met in 1895, 10 years after Queen's and the Royal Military College faced off in Kingston. McGill principal Dr. Bernard Shapiro and Queen's principal Dr. William Leggett, a former vice-principal at McGill, will take part in a pre-game ceremony. McGill entertains RMC tomorrow night at 7. Canadian spirits high Soccer team can still finish third at Gold Cup Canadian Press PASADENA, Calif. - Like an exhausted boxer, battered and bruised from a lopsided fight, the Canadian soccer team returned to practice yesterday after yet another dramatic finale at the Gold Cup. Players limped off the bus some 12 hours after their 4-2 loss on penalty kicks to the U.C. MONTREAL SPORTS FINAL FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 2002 65 (OUTSIDE METRO AREA 854) ""CJH0! ""I 1 C3C3 They say they’re allowed as little as 15 or 20 seconds to assess each visitor arriving at ports of entry. Arrivals are waved through even when their language isn't understood. WILLIAM MARSDEN The Gazette Call it the 15-second defence. Canada's front line against terrorists or other undesirables seeking entry to the country is basically a customs officer who has 15 to 20 seconds to check a traveler's story. The current system of assessing visitors arriving at our airports and other ports of entry still relies heavily on a thin line of often overworked customs officials whose main responsibility is checking for smugglers. Terrorists or other criminals are secondary. What's more, Canada Customs admits that nothing has changed since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ""The only thing we have changed is to make sure officers enter everybody's name into the computer,"" said Sgt. Andre Belleville of Canada Customs. ""But we have been doing that really all along."" In fact, harried customs agents, pushed to process hordes of visitors at busy airports across the country, are given little more than 15 to 20 seconds to decide whether a visitor is a possible security risk and should be detained for an immigration check, according to former immigration agents interviewed by The Gazette. Belleville says these are not official quotas and an agent can take longer. Nevertheless, that's the expected time at airports, the immigration agents say. And they are pushed to stick to it. So after the one-tier check, when customs waves a traveler through with a coded customs card, the person is free to grab his luggage and enter the country. Immigration agents play no part in this vetting. Please see CUSTOMS, Page A7 Refugee watched by CSIS, Page A7 NEW RULES Want to sue cop? Make it snappy GEORGE KALOGERAKIS Gazette Justice Reporter New rules for the merged city of Montreal make it harder to sue police for negligence or wrongful arrest. When the Montreal Urban Community police existed as the regional force, people had three years to sue. Since the MUC police became Montreal police on Jan. 1, the deadline dropped to six months. And those who want to sue must send a warning letter within 15 days of whatever incident they feel warrants a lawsuit. That warning letter wasn't necessary before. New rules and regulations for the amalgamated city, drafted by the Quebec government as part of the process of imposing municipal mergers, have raised the ire of some lawyers who specialize in suing police forces. Reevin Pearl said yesterday that the change erodes the rights of the public. ""People don’t run to a lawyer immediately,"" he said. ""It doesn’t hit them right away. They are still in shock. They have to think about it first."" The new deadlines refer to all cases except those of personal injury or death, for which the delay remains three years. Here are some examples of what is affected: A man illegally detained in police cells or wrongfully arrested on insufficient evidence. A landlord who sees police damage one of his apartments during a raid. An improper police response worsens damage caused by a riot or a thief. Pearl gave an example in which he represented merchants who successfully sued police after the 1993 Stanley Cup riots. Police had reacted slowly when hordes of rioters looted stores along St. Catherine St. Please see LAWSUITS, Page A2 -WEATHER- o o o e o o o o o o e o e o e Stormy Today's high, -4 Tonight's low, -12 Details, Page C I I INDEX- Aubin B3 Auto Plus B6 Boone A 2 Bridge B9 Brownstein A 6 Business C I City Life A6 Classified B6 Comics C I 2 Comment B3 Crosswords B7, C1 1 Editorials B2 Horoscope B7 Lamey C I Landers B10 Legals Auctions B10 Movies D2 Nation All Needletrade B9 Obituaries B10, BU Phillips C11 Preview D 1 RSVP B5 Scoreboard C I O Sports C7 Stewart B3 Todd C7 TV Listings 09 What's On D10, D11 Wonderword B9 QUOTE It has yet to be proven that intelligence has any survival value.

At home in soul of the community IRWIN BLOCK The Gazette It was always a small downtown neighbourhood, tucked below the CPR tracks, but the importance of Little Burgundy to Montreal was far greater than its size. It nurtured the famous - like jazz stars Oscar Peterson, Oliver Jones and Charlie Biddle - and the not-so-famous. Former Alouettes football star Ivan Livingstone remembers that part of the St. Henri district, just west of Mountain St., as the heart and soul of Montreal's black community well into the 1960s. ""We went through some very difficult times,"" Livingstone recalled when interviewed about Black History Month, which starts today. His memories include living with his 11 brothers and sisters in a ""cold Gat"" heated by a kerosene stove. ""I remember my dad couldn’t afford the $22 a month rent downtown in 1939 or 1940. We had to make sacrifices."" Then there were the racist taunts that Livingstone faced while playing football at Macdonald College of McGill University. ""I was called 'nigger' by my teammates. Once, we lost a game against the University of Ottawa and I had scored five touchdowns, yet they blamed the loss on me."" Livingstone was part of a tough yet dynamic community that included the walk-up tenements between Mountain St. and Atwater Ave., and went south from the tracks to St. Jacques St. The people there didn't have much but they had dreams and a strong community to support them.

After three days of record-breaking warmth, yesterday's freezing rain and slicing winds drew only the most ardent anti-capitalists outdoors. The sight of cops in full riot gear mounted on horses and others toting submachine guns may have also been a deterrent. Television pictures of New York police rehearsing crowd-control tactics were beamed across the country all week. 'MEDIA STUNT' ""It was a media stunt designed to scare people away,"" said Eric Laursen of Another World Is Possible, the coalition formed to organize protests for the first WEF meeting, which was held outside the Swiss alpine village Davos. At the opening press conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani predicted police will maintain order. Please see GLOBALIZATION, Page A7 A storm blowing in from the southwestern US is expected to dump as much as 15 centimetres of snow and ice pellets on Montreal by tonight, snarling traffic and delaying or cancelling flights. ""This is the first major storm of the season affecting southern Quebec and the St. Lawrence Valley,"" Environment Canada meteorologist Laura Lam said yesterday. Heavy-snow warnings are in effect for Montreal, the Laurentians, Quebec City and the lower St. Lawrence. Total accumulation in the Quebec City region is expected to reach 25 centimetres. The snow and ice pellets falling on Montreal this morning could change to freezing rain this afternoon as the temperature climbs to about minus-3C, Lam said. The weather is expected to be fine tomorrow, with a high of minus-8, followed by light snow Sunday and Monday, with highs of minus-1.

BRIEFS IN HOBART, Australia, unseeded Jana Nejedly of Toronto hampered by a sore groin and windy conditions, was beaten 6-2, 6-0 by seventh-seeded Barbara Schett of Austria in second-round action at the Tasmanian International women's tournament. WINTER SPORTS Canadian speed-skater Jeremy Wotherspoon swept the 500- and 1,000-metre events while teammate Catriona Le May Doan earned a gold and silver in the same events yesterday at a World Cup long-track speed-skating meet in Baselga Di Pine, Italy. Wotherspoon, from Red Deer, Alta, posted a track record in the 1,000 metres with a time of one minute, 11.68 seconds and another course record in the 500 in 36.34 seconds. Le May Doan won her second 500 metres in as many days and her fourth straight in 38.83 seconds, followed by Canadian teammate Susan Auch at 38.90. In the 1,000 metres, Franziska Schenk of Germany maintained a 10-point World Cup lead with a second straight win in 1:18.37. Le May Doan, second overall, followed in 1:18.43. Auch was sixth. The last pre-Olympic competition for the Canadian sprinters is the world sprint championships in Berlin Jan. 24-25. IN MILAN, Italy, Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, who have skated together only 18 months, won the European figure-skating pairs title, establishing themselves as Olympic contenders. It was the 31st time in the last 34 years that Russian or former Soviet skaters won the European pairs gold. OUTDOORS RON PINET From now to the end of March, the north branch of the Yamaska river is open to trout fishing. The combination of rapids and underground alkaline spring seepages helps keep the river ice-free for 8 kilometres downstream from its headwaters in Lac Boivin through the town of Granby. Rivers that flow through limestone have a higher pH, which raises its freezing point and supports more insects and crustaceans, such as scuds or freshwater shrimp, which encourage the fish to eat (and grow) year-round. The Association des Chasseurs et Pecheurs de l'Estrie, in collaboration with the Department of the Environment, have been stocking the river with over 60,000 brown, brook and rainbow trout since 1992, as well as undertaking stream-improvement measures. The $10 permit includes member the restless age-limit rule is. Anna Kournikova returns volley yesterday in loss to Lindsay Davenport from Aussie Open since suffering calf injury last month. The country also picked up the silver with Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev, who were third after the short program. Five-time French national champions Sarah Abitbol and Stephane Bernadis slid to third. SOCCER The Impact has traded midfielder Darko Kolic and future considerations to the Edmonton Drillers for midfielder Ziad Allan, who is expected to arrive in Montreal today. Ziad, a 27-year-old native of Kuwait, had 16 points in eight games with Edmonton this season in the National Professional Soccer League. He spent the last two seasons in the Continental Indoor Soccer League with the Houston Hotshots and was the CISL's second-leading scorer in 1997 with 35 goals and 29 assists. IN LONDON, Arsenal needed a penalty shootout to overcome modest Port Vale while Sheffield Wednesday edged Watford of the Second Division on a night of tense FA Cup games. Arsenal, held 0-0 at Highbury and then 1-1 at Vale Park, eventually subdued its First Division rival 4-3 on penalties while Sheffield Wednesday downed Watford 5-3 in another shootout at Hillsborough after the two teams had ended extra time tied at 0-0. Aston Villa struggled to beat First Division Portsmouth 1-0 at home in another third-round replay, while Wolves romped to a 4-0 win at Third Division Darlington. MISCELLANY The city of Indianapolis has reached a new lease with the National Football League's Colts that will keep the team in the city for at least the next 10 years. These collaborative ventures between clubs and the provincial government are becoming more popular, to the benefit of both. Is it necessary to add that you should call Tourism Granby at (514) 372-7273 for conditions? The Lower Canada Arms Collectors Association will be holding its first Arms Fair of the new year on Sunday, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Place Desaulniers, 1023 Taschereau Blvd. in Longueuil. With more than 40 tables and exhibits, you'll find something absolutely essential that you had no idea you needed. Flies are artificial lures concocted of fur, feathers and synthetic material, which are tied to a hook and intended to entice or aggravate fish into biting them. Of the thousand or so patterns, some try to imitate actual insects in compulsive detail, while others are more expressionistic. No one has verified which the fish prefer, but the variety available offers the excuse that when the fish aren't biting, it's because the wrong fly is on the end of the tippet holding her back. The city will provide the Colts with about $8.9 million a year as part of a new lease. Team owner Jim Irsay had been negotiating a deal since last spring. He had never threatened to move the team, but said the extra revenue was vital to keeping the Colts competitive in the NFL. IN PHOENIX, baseball's executive council approved changes to the postseason format, giving more advantages to the teams with the best regular-season records. Teams with the top records - excluding wild cards - will have the home-field advantage in the first two rounds of the playoffs, under a resolution approved by the council. In addition, the teams with the best records will have the home fields in Games 1, 2 and, if necessary, 5. IN BERMUDA DUNES, Calif., Andrew Magee, seeking his first PGA Tour victory in more than three years, clipped seven shots off par on the front nine in a 9-under 63 that gave him the first-round lead in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. Fred Couples, Brad Fabel and Steve Lowery were a shot behind after the opening day of the 90-hole tournament held at four different courses in the desert resort area. IN LAS VEGAS, Nev., the former owners of the Houston Rockets said they have purchased one-quarter of the National Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings for $37.5 million and might consider buying a bigger piece of the team. Members of the Maloof family of New Mexico also said they took a look at buying into the San Antonio Spurs, but that those negotiations did not produce a deal. Lord Byron's arch comment on fishing - that it is an activity involving a fish on one end and a fool on the other - comes to mind for some reason, but who was he to criticize such a wholesome and benign pastime? One of its pleasures is the tying of flies. Usually many flies, because fly boxes look complete when packed hackle to hackle, and because of the worry that the one fly you don't have is the very one the fish will be elbowing each other out of the way for in their eagerness to impale themselves upon it. This is called equipment anxiety: the belief that more and better tools will produce better results. Peter Farago of the Boutique Classique Angler (414 McGill St. in Old Montreal, 878-3474) is offering 15-hour fly-tying classes for beginners on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays, from 6:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. The five-week course costs $50 and all equipment is supplied. He is also prepared to teach an intermediate-level course, if enough people are interested. This could be the beginning of a beautiful hobby. You can send E-mail to Ron Pinet at: rpinet@istar.ca. Leagues affected by storm But there are ways to make up games. League members who missed a night of bowling as a result of the ""storm of the century"" can make it up in a number of ways. Bowlers can either play what amounts to a double-header at a later date, bowl on a different day, or have the season extended by a week. Another option is to drop the week completely. Fortunately, most sanctioned leagues have a rule in their constitution that dictates what steps will be taken in the event of power outages or storms. A number of tournaments also fell victim to the storm, including the second leg of the Canadian Tire Challenge at Centre 440, which has been postponed until this weekend. The final is slated for Sunday afternoon. The task of rescheduling will likely be the first order of business when leagues resume play this week, so be prepared to vote for the choice that you prefer, and hope that a majority of your peers feel the same way. Jocelyn Carre and Ghislain Renaud have dominated the field on the Canadian Tire Challenge telecasts on RDS. Both bowlers have won eight consecutive matches, while earning $5,500 and averaging 226 and 234, respectively. In the Canadian Tire Open at Laurentian Lanes, Bahjat Zoorob has also won eight consecutive matches on TV while pocketing $5,900. Jacques Hamelin remains in second place with five consecutive wins, while Eric Bourret has four wins to his credit. Qualifications for the final leg of the tournament have already begun and will continue through next weekend, with the finals slated for the evening of Jan. 25. The event should provide great drama, as always. The recently contested Montreal Youth Tenpin Association's team trios tournament at Pincourt Lanes saw the team of Bruno Hebert, Marc-Andre Daigneault and Patrick Roger beat the team of Josh Benoliel, Jonathan Marcotte and Michael Frascarelli by 106 pins to capture the handicap division. In the tightly contested scratch division, Mathieu Valliers, Amelie St. Onge and Frederic Fries tied the team of Daniel Skitt, Jamie Barnoff and Randy Ryan for the silver medal, falling 13 pins short of the gold-medal performance by Mathieu Valliers, St. Onge and Stephanie Hamelin. Gerry Auger captured the 440 New Year's Pressure Cooker tournament with a surprisingly low score of 205. To stay alive, bowlers had to roll a minimum of 160 in the first game, 170 in the second game and so on. Ross Hargrave, Leslie Kalapos, Paul Plasse and Hirsh Schnayer made it to the final round, but succumbed to the pressure and were cooked. Here are some of the interesting statistics from the recently published 1997 edition of the MTBAMWTA yearbook. Thirty-five sanctioned 300 games were rolled last year, while the nearly impossible 7-10 split was converted nine times. Bowlers who surpassed the elusive 800 mark last season included: Paul Plasse, Juan Roquebert, Donald Dagenais, Frank Buffa (twice), Kevin Jessiman, Frank Herriott and Gaetan Cusson. Finally, congratulations are due to the following bowler-of-the-year winners: A Class: Frank Buffa, Danyck Briere, Hirsh Schnayer, Celine Desautels, Debby Ship, Helene Brousseau. B Class: Robert Boutin, Stephane Larocque, Sylvain Thuot, Linda Fure, Patricia Humphreys, Jose Ladouceur. C Class: Michel McKenzie, Giuseppe Porco, Michel Racicot, Monique Lagendresse, Dominique Hadrill, Linda Bradley.

THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 15, 1998 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 15, 1998 WEG7 WEST END: THE STORM OF '98 G6WE MARIE-FRANCE COALLIER, GAZETTE Nelson Perez, 3, shows off by flexing his muscles at the shelter at Centre de Loisir in Cote des Neiges. Watching are his 11-year-old brother, Julio (far right) and the Naims, Oussama, 6, Hamza, 4, and Siham, 12. Emergency funding City makes aid available to help welfare recipients buy food ALLISON LAMPERT Special to The Gazette Loading stacks of microwave dinner-like trays into a van, Multi-Caf worker Fred Mehrabi is thrilled that the community food bank, for once, has too much food. The Cote des Neiges based organization helped feed residents of the 400-bed Centre de Loisir Communautaire - the area's largest shelter. ""Today there's a surplus, tomorrow who knows,"" Mehrabi said as he transported the food back to the depot. Mehrabi anticipated the demand for food among people with low incomes would grow dramatically as they return home from shelters to refrigerators filled with spoiled food. ""It's a big problem. One of our big worries is that people will go home, find that they have no money and eat whatever is left over even if it might be rotten,"" said Project Genesis worker Gary Saxe. ""There's one family that has electricity at home but is staying here (at the shelter) just to have dinner,"" Saxe said. Like many local community workers, Mehrabi believed the freezing rain and power outages have been devastating for West End residents on low incomes. This is because many local welfare recipients are just finding out about emergency measures taken by the Quebec government in response to the situation, after what advocacy groups call a difficult wait. The province is currently issuing emergency cheques and payment guarantees to welfare recipients who have lost food during the storm, said Pierre Baraby, a spokesman for the Ministry of Employment and Solidarity. The amount of emergency aid is to be determined by welfare agents on a case-by-case basis, he said. A spokesman for Montreal's Revenue and Securities Department, Roch Corriveau, said these measures are allowing recipients to purchase food at stores with the guarantee that the province will compensate merchants later. Although Corriveau noted that there had been no publicity about the emergency aid since it became available last Monday, the city had issued 260 cheques on Tuesday alone. ""In certain offices we've had huge lineups,"" Corriveau said. But local advocacy groups were angry that the measures were not better publicized. ""We think it's unfortunate that the government did not make the news public,"" said Project Genesis lawyer Rick Goldman. ""Unlike other areas of Montreal, in Cote des Neiges, a lot of people are still getting out of shelters,"" he said. ""It's impossible for people to get any information. There were only three telephone lines for (350) people."" Elvia Perez and her three sons had been living at the shelter for a week after their Van Home St. apartment lost electricity. Playing with her 11-year-old son, Julio, Perez remained optimistic even though she has no idea how she'll be able to buy more food. ""It's alright, we'll get by, we're all really fat,"" the Mexican native said. But another resident, 41-year-old Abdi Elmi, is not as confident. He spent more than a quarter of his $360 a month welfare cheque on food, only to have lost perishables such as meat and chicken. ""If I go home, I have nothing to eat,"" he said Tuesday. Other people on low incomes have to cover storm costs aside from food, said Project Genesis community organizer Jennifer Auchinleck. ""A lot of people had to spend extra money on batteries, candles, transportation."" While many shelters in the West End this week were nearly filled to capacity, few homeless people decided to spend the night. ""We had one homeless person but he really didn't want help,"" Salvation Army worker Marilynn St. Onge said at the group's N. THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 15, 1998 DAVID SIDAWAY, GAZETTE Master Cpl. Stephane Jodoin (left) peers through the window of a Carignan home to see whether residents inside are in danger. Above, Pte. Francois Duprercg checks house off his list after inspecting the grounds. Army marches in Blackout victims hail soldiers for patrolling neighbourhoods and bringing order to chaos LYNN MOORE The Gazette The best news in a ""situation that has got worse at every turn"" was the arrival of the Canadian Forces in her town, Carignan Mayor Renee Legendre told everyone who would listen yesterday. ""The army's help is extraordinarily important. Everybody has to be told that,"" Legendre said as residents of her South Shore community streamed into the town's second emergency shelter, set up yesterday morning by the army. The cold snap, which began Tuesday, has increased the danger levels for those trying to remain in cold homes. Before dawn, ""about 60 people, including children and whole families, were found trying to sleep in their cars"" by roving patrols of Carignan security officers and volunteers, Legendre said. Those residents, trying to make do with woodstoves and fireplaces, probably had heard that there wasn't any more room to stretch out in the town's original shelter, she said. ""But at least they could have found a place to sit (in the shelter) and be warm,"" Legendre said. ""It's very dangerous trying to sleep in cars."" By lunch yesterday, the army had opened Carignan's second shelter, for 170 temporary inhabitants, set up a camp kitchen, and - perhaps most importantly - established a presence, exuding a sense of order and calm amid chaos and confusion. ""We need strong arms, equipment, firewood, hot food and we need to know what's happening,"" Legendre said. The mayor was highly critical of the provincial government, the provincial police and provincial civil-protection officials. ""For seven days, until Monday, there was a total absence of communication and information,"" she said. When she heard Monday night that a ""turf war"" had erupted because the Surete du Quebec or the union representing its rank and file felt its members should patrol storm-ravaged Quebec, Legendre spent half the night worrying that the army would be yanked out of her area, she said. Brig.-Gen. Christian Couture, who commands about 4,700 of the 9,000 soldiers deployed across southern Quebec in the aftermath of last week's ice storm, noted yesterday that the Surete is in charge of the overall coordination of policing efforts. ""There may be some (jealousy and power-jostling between the army and Surete), but I have not experienced any of it,"" Couture said as he surveyed operations in Boucherville. Whether working with provincial or municipal police officers or members of their own unit, his men ""feel privileged and have a sense of accomplishment in assisting their fellow citizens,"" Couture said. Meanwhile, on the outskirts of Carignan, a commandeered school bus full of soldiers lumbered around sinkholes in the thick ice that has consumed Lareau Rd. At various points, pairs of soldiers disembarked, boots with thick treads on their feet and smiles on their faces. ""Our orders are to go door-to-door on the left side of this street and determine if the residents are adequately protected from the cold,"" Master Cpl. Stephane Jodoin explained. The soldiers were on the lookout for homeowners using dangerous fuels like kerosene to heat their homes. If they found any, their job was to convince the residents it was time to move or alert police to the situation. Many homes appeared empty and well-secured by departed storm victims, but the soldiers had to check them out and note their location for later patrols. That meant traversing yards that had been turned into skating rinks, jumping fences to peer into back windows and occasionally scrambling up garage roofs to peer into upper windows. ""I like it that the army is here,"" said Nadia Guerin, whose family had remained in their home thanks to a dual heating system that uses wood and a generous neighbour who shares his generator. ""I know a couple in Chambly who stayed in their home beyond the point when it was safe,"" Guerin said. ""It was the army that convinced them it was time to get out."" Clearing trend Work crews battle bitter cold, slippery sidewalks and fatigue to remove dangerous branches and ice YVONNE ZACHARIAS The Gazette Slowly, steadily, Benoit Laplante digs the picks strapped to the bottom of his heavy work boots into the bark as he climbs the tree. It rocks slightly with each step. So does the chainsaw dangling from his waist. But his eyes never waver from the branches above him. He studies them carefully, deciding where to loop the rope next. It's a decision not to be made lightly. It is the only difference between his perch in the sky and the hard ground - oh, say, a good 10 metres below. Reaching behind him, he swings the chainsaw to the front. Dangling at mid-branch, he yanks a cord. The power saw fires up, its racket splitting the cold, clear air. He slices through tree limbs, sending a constant shower of ice and branches crashing to the ground. A bird swoops overhead. Life in a pinched and bent-over city passes by on the street below. But Laplante does not give it a passing thought. He has too many other things on his mind - where the branches will fall, where the rope is, where his feet are. ""There's no room for error,"" he said later, warming up in the cab of a truck. Just as no two trees are alike, he knows. He's spent 17 years dangling from them. Laplante isn't the type of guy to think of himself as a hero. Tell him that he's part of the minus-15 club, the army of tree acrobats, firefighters, Hydro-Quebec crews and others working from dawn to dark in the cold to piece together a broken city. Just try it and that chiseled face of his would crack into a crooked smile. But look up, look way up, and you'll see them there, clearing menacing branches, chipping ice from rooftops, grappling with the snarled electrical wires that have given a city so much grief. Things are never quite the way they look from the ground. Take the situation of the firefighters clearing ice from a street in Old Montreal. There's the cold seeping into their yellow rubber boots, into their heavy leather gloves. A spray of ice and snow swirls up. ""It's freezing like hell,"" firefighter Robert Labelle says. ""I don't mind because of the situation we're in,"" each time their axes fly into the solid sheet coating the ledge of a building. But life way up in a cherry-picker has another downside. It's the swaying. Some never get used to it, firefighter Robert Labelle says. Others hardly notice it after an hour. ""You see up there,"" he says, pointing with his gloved finger up to where two other firefighters are swinging like madmen at a phantom enemy. ""Look at how it moves."" Then there's the fleeting thought that the supposedly fail-proof crane hoisting them into the sky could fail after all. ""It's supposed to be mechanically safe, but you never know."" With the same gloved finger, he points to the boom, or the bottom part of the crane. ""Do you have any idea how hot the oil is in there right now?"" In case there aren't enough reminders of the dangers, a huge piece of ice came crashing down on a fire truck yesterday morning. ""It has a few things missing now, like the lights in the front,"" Labelle noted. The streets of Old Montreal were pretty much deserted yesterday, except for the army, the unmistakable red fire trucks that were there to make things safe for the clerks, the bookkeepers, the secretaries - the company men and women - before they return to their warm, comfortable offices. Labelle spots someone going into an entryway. Good. That means another place to get warm. ""It's freezing like hell. I'm freezing my butt off,"" Labelle wasn't complaining, though. ""I don't mind because of the situation we're in."" Situation, now that's one way of summing up the rain, broken branches, downed power lines, falling sheets of ice. Hell freezing over. No wonder a Hydro worker from the Gaspe has a few words to say about the boss, ""le patron."" ""The boss has targets to meet, a magic number of happy customers at the end of the day. Him and his objectives."" The worker mutters something incomprehensible about the world and people being more important. ""You have to block it all out,"" he said. ""You have to concentrate on the job."" Understand that he's been working 16-hour days. That the footing underneath has turned to solid ice, that no one has cleared the branches from the street and that all the equipment is freezing up in the sub-zero temperatures. Even the oil in the truck's hydraulic engine doesn't circulate properly in this kind of weather, he explains between deep drags on his cigarette. What's his name? He looks at the reporter as if she's crazy, then breaks into laughter. ""Do I honestly think he will give his name after all that business about le patron?"" Back at his tree-pruning operation near Dawson College, Laplante swings from branch to branch, giving himself a slight push-off each time, his chainsaw flying behind as an afterthought. On the ground below him, blood congeals on Jean-Guy Godin's face. Scratches from branches, he explains. He and Luc Prault catch them as they fall, then shove them into a maw that spits them out as wood chips. ""Hell, no, they aren't cold. Even if they were, do you think they'd admit it?"" French are urged to get out of the cold, doctors advise to provide warmth for crisis victims. Consider leaving home if indoor temperature plunges below 7C. Presse Canadienne PARIS - The Association France-Quebec issued an appeal yesterday to the French to provide financial aid to victims of Quebec's ice storm and power crisis. Donations will be collected by the association and turned over to the Red Cross in Quebec. ""We received an enormous number of calls from our members, asking what they could do,"" explained Georges Poirier, president of France-Quebec. ""Many French have close friends or relatives in the hardest-hit regions. They couldn't help but react."" The Association France-Quebec, founded 30 years ago, is one of the principal organizations fostering close relations between France and the province. In France, it has about 5,000 members. An appeal for aid is to be published today in hundreds of regional newspapers. It is the first aid operation of its kind undertaken by the organization. French media, which rarely cover Quebec events outside elections and referendums, have been giving heavy coverage to the storm damage and power outages. JEFF HEINRICH The Gazette How do you survive in a cold house if it's minus-20 degrees Celsius outside? You don't, so don't risk it, public-health officials warned yesterday. ""With temperatures where they're at now, if people are in their homes with no source of heat, and they haven't had any for several days, it's unthinkable that they stay,"" said Dr. Lucie-Andree Roy, spokesman for Montreal's environmental-health unit. ""Trying to sleep in a cold house, when it's minus-20 outside - it's crazy. Our advice is, if the house temperature drops below 7 degrees, people should start thinking very seriously about leaving."" Stay, and your risk of hypothermia - literally, freezing to death - increases. You'll know when it starts: although your breathing and pulse might be normal, you begin shivering all over, feel groggy and can't quite think straight. That's mild hypothermia. Beware of the danger signs that mild is turning to moderate and even severe, the Ottawa-based Canada Safety Council warns: With moderate hypothermia, the shivers get violent. You can't pay attention. Your breathing gets slow, shallow. Your pulse slows too, and gets weak. When the hypothermia gets severe, you stop shivering altogether. You lose consciousness. You breathe only a little, or not at all. Your pulse goes from weak to irregular to none at all. If you're stuck, how can you ward off the cold? Do the following: Wear a warm hat. Wear layered clothing. Protect your feet and hands. And don't fall into the traps of losing interest, going to sleep, or drinking alcohol or smoking - you'll just get cold faster. If you find someone who has hypothermia, here's some basic first aid: Handle the person gently; too rough, and his heart may stop. Keep him horizontal. Get him warm with clothes or blankets, including under him. If he's conscious, give him something warm to drink (not alcohol or coffee). If he's unconscious and not breathing, do artificial respiration. If there's no pulse, do cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Don't do the following: Don't rub the person's body to improve circulation; all you're doing is helping cold blood flow back to the body's core, making it even colder. Don't apply direct heat from things like water bottles; they can cause the heart to beat irregularly. Don't make the person exercise; exhaustion makes hypothermia worse. And if you really insist on staying at home, think again. If it's a shelter you're avoiding, or you don't want to impose on strangers or relatives with heat, you want to protect your house from looters, or you simply want to be there when the power comes back, consider the consequences. That home you cherish so much could be your last place of residence.

BY GUY THIBAUDEAU Things are slowly getting back to normal in the Laurentians and Lanaudiere while they are at a dead halt in the Eastern Townships and Montérégie. Here ski areas are under Hydro orders not to operate ""until further notice."" There is fear that this could extend to the end of next week if the South Shore situation remains as it is. Meanwhile Laurentian areas are restricted to minimal operation using lifts sparingly, not making snow or providing night skiing despite mid-winter conditions. Quebec and Charlevoix areas, however, are far enough away from the weather calamity and have no restrictions. They also were not affected by any freezing rain. Cross-country is excellent in the Quebec City region as well as in Lanaudiere and a few Laurentians centres such as Esterel, the Linear Park, Far Hills and the wider trails at St. Jovite-Mont Tremblant.

PAUL B. BRADING Lachine CJAD needs Duff back on staff. Bravo to CJAD's Jim Duff for understanding why, in extreme circumstances, it is necessary to put public service ahead of the bottom line. When CJAD went off the air Jan. 9, I immediately switched over to Mix 96 under the false assumption that, surely, programming staff would have moved CJAD's continuous news coverage over to its FM sister station. Under the circumstances, it was the easiest decision to make until CJAD had secured an alternate transmitter site. More importantly, breaking Mix 96's format would have been the easiest choice to ensure that Montrealers received the up-to-the-minute information they required. Instead, we heard almost continuous music on Mix 96 on the night of Jan. 9, when most of Montreal was plunged into darkness at the peak of the province's worst ice storm in history. General manager Rob Braide did a great disservice to Montrealers by not following Jim Duff's advice. Radio licenses are regulated to ensure that the public is properly served. The CRTC should respond when profits are put ahead of public service in times of crisis. Listeners will undoubtedly remember the night that CJAD management put profits and dance music ahead of public service. Sound programming decisions pay off in the ratings. CJAD's decision, in this case, was not sound. CJAD needs Mr. Duff back on staff. His judgment was sound and he put his professional reputation on the line to defend the best interests of Montrealers. Can the same be said of Standard Broadcasting's upper management? BRIAN BOYER Montreal recently despaired of our future, and who were saddened by the apparent lack of compassion of certain political and religious leaders, should take heart. We will probably never have political harmony unless we first have social harmony. So in the years ahead, when we look back on the way fellow citizens have come together in common cause, I believe that we will be able to say with real pride that these have been our finest hours. RICHARD TOBIN Share the Warmth Montreal Banks offend. It has been very refreshing to see chivalry, respect, decency, sharing and caring from individuals, drivers, small-business owners, community centres and shopping centres during this ice-storm crisis. However, I have yet to see a certain business sector that has declared huge profits and is dependent on the very tiny as well as the most well-off of people reach into its coffers and hand out a coin or two. I find it very offensive the banks are not prepared to help out by providing food to Sun Youth or a shelter or two, for example, or even offering to pay for daycare in certain areas where they operate. I'd boycott banks. Unfortunately, what alternative do we have?

But you can't help but think that something very weird has been happening to Mother Nature and maybe, just maybe, she is paying us back. We've seen a lot of freak weather lately. In only five days, 100 millimetres of freezing rain - about two normal years' worth - fell on Montreal and in parts of eastern Canada. Last year's floods in Manitoba's Red River and in Quebec's Saguenay region were also caused by weather gone awry. Calgary and Winnipeg were devastated by hail storms in the summer of 1996. Vancouver is buried in snow and just last month in Edmonton, people were golfing and playing tennis outdoors. Outside Canada, the weather hasn't been any less extreme. Last month, snow fell and temperatures plummeted to minus-20C in parts of Mexico. The Pacific island of Guam was hit with winds of up to 380 kilometres an hour, the highest ever recorded. In Ecuador, there were flash floods. Last year, extreme drought caused fires that ravaged Indonesia and destroyed crops in Malaysia and the Philippines. It's almost as if extreme weather has become the norm around the world. Some climate experts blame El Nino, the recurring movement of warm water in the Pacific Ocean that produces warm air flows affecting weather around the world, including the weather that caused last week's ice storm. While we have known about El Ninos for about 500 years, there is little data about their intensity. But based on what we know - there have been 11 recorded in the past 53 years - there is evidence that El Ninos have been more intense, frequent and longer-lasting in recent years. Could the warming of the Earth's surface have an impact on the intensity of El Ninos? Eleven of the 12 warmest years of the past century and a half have occurred since 1980. Is there a connection between global warming, El Nino and the ice storm? JENNIFER ROBINSON ""We don't really know,"" says Environment Canada senior climatologist Dave Phillips. No direct link can be made between global warming and the extreme weather we have been seeing in many parts of the world. While many scientists suspect that global warming has the potential to create extreme weather systems, no scientific link has been made between warming and climatic change, much less to disasters like last week's ice storm. ""We know the Earth is warmer - a half a degree warmer than a century ago,"" Mr. Phillips said. ""We suspect that burning fossil fuels, carbon-dioxide emissions and other forms of pollution have contributed to warming. What scientists don't know yet is how exactly it affects climate."" For those who think that global warming can only be a bonus for Canadians who spend half the year in a deep freeze, last week should give us cause to think again. The warm air from the unusual El Nino that flowed into eastern Canada brought freezing rain instead of the snow that could have fallen if temperatures had been a bit colder. Climate-change experts predict that there could be more ice storms to come. This is the harsher side of what global warming may mean to Canada. But it is a possibility that federal and provincial governments have preferred to downplay. Canada is one of the world's largest contributors to increased greenhouse-gas emissions this decade. Despite a much-ballyhooed commitment in 1992 at a conference in Rio de Janeiro to cut emissions by the year 2000 to 1990 levels, Canada's carbon-dioxide emissions have increased 13 percent. The U.S.'s performance was worse. That country's emissions increased 15 percent despite its commitment at the Rio conference. Last month, there was another conference, this time in Kyoto, and another promise to reduce emissions, this time by Jean Chretien's Liberal government. Canada, like other countries, vowed to cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2007 (for Canada, that represents a 20-percent reduction from current levels) and even further by 2015. Last week's storm should be enough to convince us all, including our political leaders, that not only must the promise be kept, but that cutting emissions is more urgent than we think. After last week's devastation, I don't need any more proof that when we hurt the environment, Mother Nature will pay us back. Jennifer Robinson is associate editor of The Gazette.

THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 13, 1998 THE POWER CRISIS Officials mull fate of schools on South Shore Board chiefs, provincial authorities will debate when to resume classes A6 JOHN KINNEY, GAZETTE Striding along an icy sidewalk past the tangled debris of fallen tree branches, a young man on Walkley Ave. shielded his ears against the biting cold yesterday. Makeshift heaters blamed for poisoning 'epidemic' JEFF HEINRICH The Gazette Try telling a homeowner he can't heat his house if there's no electricity. The message isn't getting across to many of the 1.2 million people in the Monteregie. Firing up poorly vented generators, kerosene burners and hibachis in their homes, hundreds of people from Valleyfield to Sorel and the U.S. border have poisoned themselves with the carbon monoxide the devices give off. ""It's a major epidemic,"" said Dr. Louis Jacques, spokesman for the Monteregie public-health unit. ""People are trying to keep warm, they're desperate for heat, but they're paying the price."" And the price is high. Since the ice storm hit last week, nearly 600 homes and apartments have been polluted with carbon monoxide from bad burners, poisoning more than 1,500 people. Four have died. (By contrast in Montreal and Laval, Urgences Sante has reported 165 cases, none fatal.) Those worst hit have been taken by ambulance across the river to Montreal's Sacre Coeur Hospital. It's one of only two hospitals in Quebec equipped with a hyperbaric chamber to save victims' lives with high-pressure oxygen. And it's been extremely busy these days. Normally, the hospital treats 150 people a year who have carbon-monoxide poisoning. In the last week alone, it has treated 43, mostly from the Monteregie. The 43 include five pregnant women, two infants under age 2, and seven other children and youths under 18. Fainting, headaches, confusion, loss of judgment, nausea and vomiting - the only thing they didn't suffer was a coma and, of course, death. How did they get that way? Desperation - and carelessness. In half the cases, generators had been installed in the basement or garage of houses. Others used hibachis inside, plus a variety of propane-powered devices to stay warm. Inside Sacre Coeur's hyperbaric chamber, a steel unit that seats seven people, the air is under a lot of pressure - six times normal, the equivalent of water pressure 50 metres below the surface. It takes about two hours inside to rid the body of carbon monoxide and replace it with oxygen. Without rapid treatment, survivors could have found themselves facing new, debilitating symptoms: memory loss, dementia, Parkinson's disease and psychiatric problems. Although gas poisoning is the most insidious of health hazards from the ice storm, there are others. Trauma on the South Shore has been a constant problem: fractures from falls on ice and falling ice, burns from candles and fuels, eye injuries from tree branches as people try to clean up their yards and streets. And as people return to their homes over the next few weeks, another problem looms: mental distress. ""When they get back home, and see the extent of the damage, they will be alone and more prone to overreact,"" said Project Genesis community organizer Jennifer Auchinleck. ""A lot of people had to spend extra money on batteries, candles, transportation."" While many shelters in the West End this week were nearly filled to capacity, few homeless people decided to spend the night. ""We had one homeless person but he really didn't want help,"" Salvation Army worker Marilynn St. Onge said at the group's N.

Xianda,244,"G moved anyone anywhere so they could be better off. He had no power for seven days, but was willing to help others. Throughout all this he had to work, and even had a fire at his moving business. He was willing to help out others although he had problems of his own. FRANK CIAMPINI Tom Johnstone of Montreal West took extraordinary measures to save our 11-year-old goldfish, Sushi, when he was found at the bottom of his tank out of oxygen and almost frozen. We rushed him into a smaller tank at the Johnstone B&B, where Tom performed artificial respiration by blowing air into the tank through a straw placed near Sushi's mouth. Sushi finally began to move around. We are happy to report that our beloved goldfish lived to swim again. JENNY CHOPRA Continued from Page C2 If unsuccessful, he said the citizens will probably pitch in and pay this. It would be a small price to pay for personal protection. Besides continuing to do the nightly checks on the vacated homes and on people who insisted on staying put, power to that neighbourhood isn’t expected to be fully restored until at least Thursday. Vorias is spending most days helping his electrician brother-in-law temporarily get area residents electricity. He's also cutting branches and doing whatever I have to do. Thirteen-year-old Megan Semenchuk recognizes a hero when she sees one. And in the past two weeks, the Kirkland youngster didn't have to look far. In my mind, one of the heroes of this storm was my dad. Neil Semenchuk has been the town's recreation director since 1988, and was in charge of the emergency shelter set up at the Kirkland community centre. He gave up his time to help other people, chop wood, set up cots, made people laugh, organized meals and volunteers, the proud daughter said. Semenchuk unceremoniously celebrated his 22nd anniversary of working for the town while scrambling to accommodate area residents in need of refuge from the ice storm and its aftermath. He stressed that Jan. 12 will be an unforgettable date from now on, and not just because that is when he started his job with the municipality. Last Monday, Semenchuk was in the middle of eight chaotic days of heading a staff of eight and roughly 100 volunteers who all helped accommodate a total of at least 1,000 storm refugees. Like some of his fellow staff members and volunteers, Semenchuk averaged 19-hour days at the shelter and spent two whole nights there. I certainly didn’t do it alone, stressed the 1993 recipient of a Canada 125 medal for community work. Semenchuk called the latest undertaking the biggest operation ever thrown together at the last second. He described the entire ordeal as horrible, yet also wonderful and satisfying. I'm very proud of him and know that a lot of people helped him, said Megan, who didn’t hesitate to nominate her father for hero status. I'm proud of all of them, too. Nick Stachiew, 61, swears he saw halos above the heads of Connecticut Power Co. workers who appeared on his Pierrefonds street on Day 4 without power. We got power back the following day and I like to think it was because of them, said Stachiew, who worked through the sleet storm of '61 installing cables for Bell Canada. To show his gratitude, Stachiew gave one worker a duck he carved himself from an old telephone pole, a gift that took two months to make. It took freezing temperatures to break the ice between Lila Beaudoin and the family across the street, the Bulgarellis. Continued on Page C4 MALCOLM FOSTER Ritha Candelshine and her husband in Côte St. Luc accepted friends who, one by one, had lost power. At one point, we were five families in the house. At mealtime, there were 20 or 25 kids among us but she just kept slapping cold cuts on the table. Eventually, her house, our shelter, lost power and it was unfortunate that we had to move on - but not until the last minute. KERRY KASSELBY Jack and Karen McInnis of Chateauguay are my heroes. Their house was always full of people; their stove always had pots of soup and food. When the power was out, they used their generator and their barbecue. HELEN REDDY My friend's brother-in-law Rodney Rycroft had no power for three days, but he connected his generator to three homes for several hours at a time so that each could have heat and hot water for a few hours. His house suffered damage, but he put the needs of people before his own. KELLY Robin McIntosh, the electrician for Pointe Claire, was called in the middle of the night last Monday and returned home only last night. He worked with little or no sleep for eight days straight helping out at shelters or people at home. He deserves a medal. PHILIP LINCRIST Our boss, Michel Marchand of the McDonald's in LaSalle, kept his restaurant on Champlain Blvd. open 24 hours a day. It became a home to our customers. He refilled coffee at almost no cost and gave hot water until it ran out. MICHELLE AND LISA Bill Cordner of Beaconsfield arrived on Day 1 of the blackout to fix an ice dam on our roof. Afterward, he disappeared, only to return with a thermos of hot tea, a Coleman stove and an invitation to supper at his house, which was also out of power but had a wood stove. The next day, he returned with his generator and heated it up to 15. He was doing this for five other families, as well as clearing trees and roofs. SALLY AUCKER The Verdun police worked double shifts, knocking on people's doors and just making you feel safe. LOUISE TIMMINS Jim Graham of Kensington Ave. in N. A6 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 18, 1998 THE POWER CRISIS Residents pool resources to stay warm GENERATORS Continued from Page Al Of the municipality's 2,000 residents, about 1,400 remain in their homes or at the nearby homes of neighbours and friends, said Sureté du Quebec officer Andre Caron, who was part of a team dispatched from Quebec City to go door to door to make certain that people weren't trying to remain in freezing, dark houses. On the Island of Montreal and in the dark triangle last week, powerless residents have shown a stubborn determination to remain in their own homes. In Naperville, not far from Saint-Paul, the Sureté removed an 80-year-old woman from her home, where the temperature was below zero degrees Celsius. Her family had called the police to help them get her to safety. Most Saint Paul residents seem to be scraping by in their own homes, pooling resources and scaring up generators to keep them warm. Caron's team has visited 900 Saint-Paul homes in the past couple of days and he has noticed how many are using generator power for heat and light. In some of the homes, as many as 10 and 15 people huddle together. I'd say between one-third and one-half (of the 900 homes) have a generator, Caron said. The other half or two-thirds have wood stoves. The need for generators has made them a hot commodity for thieves. Since the storm hit two weeks ago, 40 generators have been reported stolen in the Montérégie region, Sureté Constable Ronald Boudreault said. The Sureté seized a stolen generator on Friday at a Saint-Paul residence after it was reported missing Thursday, Boudreault said. Everyone in Saint-Paul has heard that generators are being stolen, and some people are taking precautions with the life-sustaining machines. Fleury, for example, is locking his $1,000 machine in the garage when it's turned off. DR AND MRS DAVID SHIZGAL Like magicians, Marguerite Crag, a handicapped 82-year-old who lives in an autonomous senior residence, and her family, Gordon and Noreen, found sterno stoves. NO NAME When plain old I poured some wine down the kitchen drain, a couple of bottles of soft drinks were dispensed down the toilet and the shower drain got a good dose of mouthwash. No, I've not developed animosity toward these products; I was just trying to keep the pipes from freezing. These solutions all have freezing points considerably lower than water. Ice can do a lot of damage. It can burst water pipes, cause airplanes to crash, sink gigantic ships and bring a sophisticated electrical distribution system to its knees. Obviously, we need to know as much about the stuff as possible. As pure water is cooled to 0C, it begins to form ice. This simply means the H2O molecules randomly scurrying about in the liquid state assume an orderly pattern and begin to form crystals. Any substance dissolved in the water will interfere with this crystallization by getting in between the water molecules and disrupting the ordered arrangement that characterizes crystal structure. Interestingly enough, the nature of the dissolved substance is not important. How low the freezing point goes is determined only by the number of dissolved molecules or ions. Salt, sugar and alcohol are all very effective at lowering the freezing point. Commercial antifreezes that are mixtures of water and methanol or water and ethylene glycol will not freeze until about minus-40. But let's get one thing straight; while salt certainly lowers the freezing point of water, it does not melt ice! Only heat can do that. So why do we throw salt on our driveway? Because salt is hygroscopic. It has a very strong attraction for water. We've all seen what humidity can do to the salt in a salt shaker. When we apply salt to ice, it begins to tug at the water molecules that make up the ice crystal. As these molecules are liberated, they are absorbed by the salt which, being soluble in water, slowly dissolves and forms a salt solution. But a salt solution has a lower freezing point than water, so unless it is really cold, it will not refreeze. Even if it does, the result is a non-slippery slush. The salt did not melt the ice, it dissolved it! Calcium chloride is even more hygroscopic than rock salt, therefore, it will dissolve ice more quickly. A real ice-buster! One of the most interesting properties of ice is that it is less dense than water, and, therefore, floats. This is very important - otherwise lakes and rivers would freeze solid, destroying all aquatic life. But the fact that water occupies more space as a solid than as a liquid can have catastrophic consequences. The sinking of the Titanic is one example. The bursting of our water pipes is another. The force exerted by the expansion of water as it forms ice is tremendous. As a student, I saw a film that featured a classic demonstration of this phenomenon. A steel bomb made of half-inch thick metal was filled with water and closed with a tight-fitting screw cap. The contraption was immersed in liquid nitrogen to freeze the water inside. Before long, there was a tremendous bang - the steel container cracked open! It was this indelible image that haunted me during the Ice Storm '98 power outage. Visions of first the hot-water pipes, then the cold-water pipes, bursting danced in my head as I contemplated draining the system. Why would the hot-water pipes freeze first? There are a couple of reasons. Gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide are more soluble in cold water than hot. Since dissolved gases can depress the freezing point, cold water has a lower freezing point than hot water. Furthermore, as cold water freezes, it releases its dissolved gases, which form an insulating layer in the pipe. Hot water has previously had all the dissolved gases driven out by heat and, therefore, cannot benefit from this type of insulation. I should point out that there are many other theories that purport to account for this effect, and there is even some controversy about whether hot-water pipes really do freeze first. But I sure wasn't going to put this to a practical test. Luckily, before I had to drain anything, the power was restored and the matter reverted to one of academic interest. And there is plenty of academic interest in this area. Tissue damage caused by ice-crystal formation precludes the freezing of human organs. If this problem is solved, large-scale organ banks might be possible. The American Cryonics Society seems unaware of this particular problem. It promotes the freezing of dead bodies with the hope that at some distant time in the future they can be thawed out and revived. In fact, it maintains it isn't even necessary to freeze the whole body; the head alone will do. By the time of ""reanimation,"" it hypothesizes, science will have progressed so far that not only can all diseases be cured, but the body can be cloned from the preserved cells. Anyone with a good head on their shoulders should be extremely skeptical of this possibility. A tissue-damage solution, if ever one is found, might come from a study of fish. Fish are cold-blooded animals, meaning they have the same internal temperature as their surroundings. Yet many species happily live in icy waters. Why don’t they freeze? Research has revealed these fish produce and store certain ""antifreeze"" proteins in their blood. These not only lower the blood's freezing point to a temperature below that of sea water, but they also inhibit the formation of large ice crystals. As soon as tiny ice crystals start to form, the antifreeze proteins coat their surface and prevent other water molecules from attaching. No large crystals of ice grow. Some preliminary experiments with rat livers indicate the addition of such fish proteins may dramatically reduce tissue damage. A more imminent possibility is the use of antifreeze proteins in ice cream to prevent a phenomenon known as re-crystallisation. This happens when large ice crystals grow upon storage and produce the disturbing crunchiness of aging ice cream. An even more exciting possibility is the insertion of a gene that codes the antifreeze protein into the genome of a plant to protect it from freezing. After all this talk about freezing, would you believe the formation of ice actually releases heat? Since it takes heat to melt ice, it stands to reason heat must be liberated when water freezes. And, indeed, it is. This principle is used by farmers who try to protect their crops from freezing by spraying them with water. The common misconception is that the layer of ice that forms acts as an insulating barrier against the cold. This is not so; it is the heat released by the water as it freezes that protects the crop. There is yet another interesting property of ice: it sublimes. In other words, it can pass straight into a vapor without going through a liquid state. Even without a thaw, a lot of this ridiculous ice will in fact sublime and disappear! Joe Schwarcz, who has a PhD in chemistry, teaches at Vanier College and McGill University. He can be seen regularly on the Discovery Channel and is heard every Friday from 10:30 a.m. to noon on CJAD radio. You can write to him c/o The Gazette Magazine, 250 St. Antoine St. Roofing. It's extremely dangerous, so we're making zero money. The woman, who wouldn’t give her last name, said some homeowners are frustrated over the refusal of roofers to repair leaks. I had a person who threatened to come down and physically harm me, she said. I told him this is not a good time. It was leaking around his air-conditioning unit. Most plumbing and electrical companies are so busy that owners and bosses who usually spend most of their time in the office are out on the road, leaving answering services to field calls. Linton Answering said it has a long list of tradesmen and for the last 12 days has been fielding calls at about four times the normal rate. As a matter of fact, I have seven calls waiting right now, said one operator, eager to get back to work. Call these numbers for help. Residents who want to report power failures and trees fallen on electrical lines can call Hydro-Quebec toll-free at (800) 790-2424.

At least this crisis isn’t constitutional. Just after New Year’s, Terry (Ais-lin) Mosher had a cartoon on The Gazette's editorial page that was simply a drawing of an ocean liner - well not just any ocean liner. It was the Titanic, except that the name on the ship was 1998. Remember, this was just two days into the new year. And the cartoon's caption had somebody on the bridge saying: ""Well, so far, so good!"" Well, here it is, just three short weeks into the new year, and we have to say in retrospect that the cartoon was pretty funny. Harhar. Most of us - well, me at least - were kind of hoping that 1998 would turn out to be better than 1997. So far, it seems, 1998 is about 18 months old. Some of us have forgotten what life was like before the crisis. But thank God for small mercies. At least this time it isn't a constitutional crisis. Novel, what? I know there are still a quarter-million people freezing on the South Shore and more scattered elsewhere, but I've had it with the Great Ice Storm of '98. This will be my last comment on the topic. It's gotten so that on Friday night I got irritated seeing people wearing ""I Survived the Ice Storm"" T-shirts produced by rival radio stations. Now I know radio did an excellent job in this emergency, as only radio can. I suppose TV did, too, but my cable is out, so the only time I got to see TV was when I ventured out to Ziggy's bar to get warm. But the crisis dragged on so long, I even started getting irritated by radio. First of all, there was the CJAD Duff affair, made all the worse because I count both Rob Braide and Jim Duff among my friends. No matter what the rights or wrongs, it was a public-relations disaster for CJAD, coming on the heels, as it were, of being knocked out of the No. 1 morning-radio spot for the first time in about a century and then getting knocked off the air by the storm. There's good reason CJAD has always been the champion of local radio (still is, if you figure the new ratings leader is a syndicated show out of Gomorrah). When CJAD was started up in the 1940s by J. Arthur Dupont, he had an affiliation arrangement with a US radio network. Back then, radio was like what network TV was to become. All the big radio shows - from Amos 'n' Andy to Boston Blackie - were network shows. Well before CJAD went on the air, CBC radio decided to exercise an option it had with the American network with which the new private station was intending to go. Disaster for CJAD! No network affiliation for a radio station! Well, CJAD had to improvise. Local radio was what they were forced to do. It was a huge success, and local radio became the winning format continent-wide as TV grew. Back then, of course, the CBC was the big boy on the radio block, and they weren't shy about using their muscle. But they never recovered from the mugging they tried to pull on CJAD. Now they are a small-time radio operation, but they managed to shine during this crisis, switching their AM operation to FM. With CJAD off the air, even for a short time, people were forced to hunt for local news. Most radio listeners are creatures of habit and leave their radio tuned to the same station all the time. But during the storm, English listeners hunted for news and found, according to my informal survey, CBC and CIQC, both of which, I'm told, did a fine job. A female lawyer friend did remark, however, that she found it odd all the announcers on CIQC were male and all the announcers on CBC appeared to be female. I listen mostly to classical music on the radio. And I have one of those radios without a dial. It's digital and you have to punch things in and I don't know how to work it, so I can't hunt around. So after a while, I started getting irritated with the CBC. They ended up with two English FM signals broadcasting their AM emergency programming. Why couldn't they give me back my classical music? French Radio-Canada did a similar switch, but reverted to regular FM music programming - with expanded news reports - much quicker than its English counterpart. Of the little TV I managed to watch, I was most impressed by the CBC's Mark Kelley. A woman friend in California phoned me to ask about the ice storm and then ended up swooning over Kelley, whose reports she had seen on CNN and NBC. He's just like the Scud Stud from the Gulf War, she said. That other Canadian, what's his name? (Arthur Kent, brother of Peter). So what should we call Kelley? The Frozen Hoser? The Chilled Canuck? The Ice Ace (stiff and hard)? The major heroes, of course, were the hydro linemen. And the populace treated them accordingly. I'm told that on Saturday night a group of linemen from Long Island, N.Y., got nicked with a $400 moving violation for his efforts. In Pierrefonds and Côte St. Luc, the heroes of the EMS discovered other heroes in the course of doing emergency rescues. Jonathan Cooperman, a 24-year-old Concordia University student, responded to an Earle Rd. house fire, to find a man, barely conscious, slumped on the floor just inside the door. The unconscious man was a neighbour who, noticing the fire and remembering there were children in the family, kicked down the door to the smoke-filled house. As it turned out, the occupants were safe and sound in a nearby shelter. When the temperature in Francine Sherman's house dipped dangerously low for her 79-year-old mother-in-law, she took her to nearby Galleries des Sources shopping mall to thaw out. Mona Yacoub happened by the mall and noticed Helen Sherman - a total stranger - sitting alone at a table and invited her to spend the night in her warm home. That woman was so lovely, said the younger Sherman. I have never met anyone like that. She gave my mother-in-law her own room in her home and at 11 o'clock at night, she spread cold cuts, bread and cheese out for all the people staying there. Besides her husband and three children, Yacoub also had another friend who was pregnant with two children staying with her. Chris Polykandriotis kicked down the door of a Pierrefonds apartment to rescue a 16-month-old baby who, in the midst of a confusing evacuation, had accidentally been locked in her home. Polykandriotis, 30, was helping drive victims of the storm from their apartments to nearby shelters, as well as getting nurses to the ill, when they got a call from a Gouin Blvd. building that was filling with carbon-monoxide fumes from a broken pipe. It was 10:30 at night and totally dark. You couldn’t see anything, Polykandriotis recalled. As he was escorting a woman out of her apartment, the door closed behind them - with the keys still inside. The woman began crying, My baby, my baby! Polykandriotis mustered up all the strength he could and kicked down the door. He scooped up the baby, wrapped it in his down coat and safely transported it to a shelter with its mother. Dawn Batson was more than a pal and neighbour to Lynn Nugent during the ice storm - she was a godsend. Here is a story that angels come disguised as friends, Nugent said, referring to the unselfishness displayed by Batson during the past two weeks. Batson's three-bedroom bungalow was one of the first homes in her Pierrefonds neighbourhood to lose power Jan. 6. But she has a wood stove in her basement and when I complained of being cold, she didn’t hesitate to welcome me and my children and another single mom into her home, Nugent recalled. Batson has two children and a 91-year-old mother she cares for while her husband is away working in the United States. Dawn hardly slept for five days for fear of having her guests go without warmth, so she was up constantly putting logs in the stove, Nugent said. I did stay up stoking the stove because I was worried about a house fire, Batson explained. That didn't prevent a near-disaster, however. One night, a fondue pot tipped over, setting her clothes and the floor ablaze. I was very lucky to put out the fire and not get burned, she said with a mix of embarrassment and relief. Both Nugent and Batson spoke of the festive atmosphere during the five nights they were all huddled together. With nine of us confined to a small area of a small house, she ignored the mess we made and had us all laughing at her Pollyanna attitude, Nugent said. We managed so well with everyone chipping in and good camaraderie, Batson added. You had to make the most of it and we had fun at times. Sometimes, laughing helps. The 46-year-old daycare worker noted one night in particular when we were sitting by the stove sipping brandy and swapping stories. Dawn doesn’t realize that, even without the wood stove, her house always offers warmth - the warmth of her heart, an appreciative Nugent stressed. A true angel. It took a fierce ice storm to thaw the year-long chill between two Kirkland neighbours. Frank Carroll said that, because of a stupid argument a year ago, he and Wesley Neilis haven’t talked. But that quickly changed Jan. 10 when an old generator loaned to Carroll blew up and started spewing thick, black smoke, he recalled. I couldn’t find the lever to turn it off and when I looked for help, I saw Wesley running up the street with a fire extinguisher and an axe. Of all the people on the street, and everyone was around that morning, he’s the last one I expected to come to my rescue, he said. Carroll noted that both men live three houses away from one another and share an Irish temper as well as the same street. He came back that night and we got drunk, he added. We are talking again. Juan Barros came to Canada from Chile in 1975 as a political refugee after spending a year being tortured in prison. And while the recent ice storm pales in comparison, it was enough to reduce the 42-year-old to tears. He was on the phone with his brother in Vancouver and crying and his brother said, Come on, you’ve been through worse than this, said his partner, Diane Gregoire, 40. But he was worried about me and my asthma. By Day 5 without power, Gregoire and Barros were starting to panic. Two shelters refused to let them in with their springer spaniel and golden retriever, so the couple set up a tent in the basement and, dressed in woolly socks, long underwear, toques, sweaters and coats, cuddled up with the dogs and two duvets. During the day, they would spend a couple of hours in their car with the engine running, then return to their underground campground. It was really warm in the tent, but if we came out, it was freezing, said Gregoire, adding that Barros kept her laughing with his jokes. By the time we got power on Tuesday, it was like Christmas. They might start calling him Super Mario from now on. Some residents in a certain block of Gardenville St. in Longueuil still knew Mario Vorias as ""Mario in diapers"" until the ice storm hit. But the 32-year-old stage technician is now being considered somewhat a saviour in his boyhood neighbourhood. When power was knocked out at his parents' Gardenville home on Jan. 6, Vorias not only came to their rescue but also helped others in the immediate vicinity bordered by Victoria, St. Laurent and Marie-Rose Sts. Marc Shaheen, who grew up on Gardenville close to the Vorias household, said his former neighbour went door-to-door on the street to convince senior citizens who had no heat to go to shelters. Shaheen noted that, since those elderly people were reluctant to leave, Vorias promised to keep an eye on their homes between police patrols. I was acting for the security of family and the community, Vorias said. I was a Scout leader in Saint-Lambert as a youth and I was just doing what I was trained for - to always be prepared. I'm glad I did my part until the cops got there four days later, he recalled. With the arrival of the police arose an incident that proved that being a good Samaritan sometimes comes with a price. Vorias's wife, Joanne Tremblay, would drive him on his nightly rounds to check on about 15 homes, but relented on Tuesday when the weather forecast called for minus-30C overnight temperatures. Although Vorias has never had a driver's license, Tremblay let him borrow her car that night. Despite having a bright-red ribbon tied to the antenna and the emergency lights flashing, Vorias was pulled over by police shortly before 1 a.m., because they suspected his slow driving meant he was casing the empty homes. Ironically, they stopped me right in front of my father's place, he said. The recently married Vorias was still using his old address, leading police to believe he was home. When they discovered he had no license, however, the police fined Vorias $400. The cops kind of went easy on me, he figured. Normally, they impound the car. Vorias plans to contest the ticket on the grounds that he was performing a humanitarian duty. Continued on Page C3 VOICES My Aunt Miriam and Uncle Pat opened their doors to me, my three children, my sister and her son. Not only did they open their doors but their refrigerator and their hearts. They never once made us feel like a burden. How can you say thank you when thank you is not enough? SUSAN ICKETT Our priest called to find out how we were coping; I told him our condition and he said he would come. I told him not to. Later, at the window, I noticed a man getting out of his car wearing a hard hat and with tree-cutting equipment. It was the Rev. Howard Hogg. He did yeoman service: he cleared the driveway, chopped overhanging branches, sawed them, bundled them, put them aside. He broke off as much as possible the ice that clogged driveway access to the street.

Xianda,245,"C was third in 52:15. The junior men's 10-kilometre event went to Gordon Jewett of Toronto in 35:21. CALGARY - Tyler Seitz of Calgary won his first Canadian senior luge title yesterday after World Cup veteran Clay Ives of Bancroft, Ont, was disqualified. Seitz, 20, who won a surprise bronze medal at the 1996 junior worlds and moved up to the Canadian senior team this season, raced to victory with a two-run time of one minute, 33.294 seconds. Arlan Dellsle of Edson, Alta, was second in 1:35.46. Ives, a four-year veteran of the national team, trailed Seitz by 6-hundredths of a second after the first run and was disqualified when the steel runners on his sled were found to exceed the maximum allowable temperature.

Ottawa to apologize, pay fees to avoid trial ROD MACDONELL THE GAZETTE: The federal government will be issuing a full apology to Brian Mulroney and paying the legal bills - estimated at more than $1 million - that the former prime minister has racked up in his unprecedented libel action against Ottawa. A source close to the case said last night that the settlement, which came about 12 hours before the trial was to begin this morning in Quebec Superior Court, was reached at the initiative of the federal government. Further details of the deal are to be made public today. Mulroney was suing Ottawa for $50 million for alleging in a letter to Swiss authorities that he had accepted as much as $5 million in kickbacks in Air Canada's 1988 purchase of 34 Airbus A320 jetliners and in two other military deals. The settlement is not expected to affect the RCMP's investigation of Mulroney, as well as Frank Moores, a former Ottawa lobbyist, and Karlheinz Schreiber, a German-Canadian businessman. The Mounties say the investigation could last another three years. Mulroney's spokesman, Luc Lavoie, said last night that Mulroney's lawyers will be in court today to advise Superior Court Justice Andre Rochon of the settlement. Lavoie confirmed that the settlement does not affect the Airbus probe and said the question did not come up in the settlement talks. ""It never was an issue for us and it still is not an issue,"" he said. ""The RCMP can investigate whoever they want.""

Ice buildup cuts power to 200,000 AARON DERFEL THE GAZETTE More than 200,000 households north of Montreal were in darkness last night after freezing rain snapped electricity lines earlier in the day. The blackouts hit a vast region stretching from east-end Riviere des Prairies to the upper Laurentians. Meanwhile, icy conditions and fog caused fender benders across the Montreal area and delayed flights in the morning at Dorval and Mirabel airports. The ice melted in the city as the temperature rose during the day. Hydro-Quebec crews were able to restore electricity to about 5,000 residents in Riviere des Prairies by late afternoon, but 200,000 households - including those in Repentigny, Saint-Sulpice and Assomption - were still without power last night. The hardest-hit regions included the Laurentians and Lanaudière; 160,000 households lost power in those two areas alone at one point. In Mauricie, 35,000 homes were blacked out, including 16,000 in the town of Louiseville, where a Hydro pylon tumbled. Other communities still without power were Sorel and Nicolet. ""We have 200 teams working around the clock to resolve the problem,"" Hydro spokesman Steve Flanagan said. ""We're doing the best we can, but the ice keeps forming on the wires and causing them to snap."" Flanagan predicted that a ""good number"" of households would still be without power early this morning. Some Hydro crews also cut off electricity on some lines for several minutes as a preventive measure to shake ice from the wires. ""When you have freezing rain that falls so quickly, it's hard to do anything about it,"" Flanagan said. ""It's not just the ice itself but tree branches that are snapping and falling on the wires.""

The lack of sunlight that has cast a pall over Montreal is triggering an unusually high incidence of SAD, or seasonal affective disorder, a depressive state associated with shorter days and prolonged cloudy weather. Mental-health clinics at the Royal Victoria and Douglas hospitals are reporting a rise in cases since the skies started casting over in December. And it's more than just winter blues. ""In late November and then through December, we had very few sunny days, and we have been receiving more calls from people who have been experiencing so-called seasonal depression,"" said Royal Vic psychiatrist A. Missagh Ghadirian. ""It is the light, more than the temperature, which affects this kind of people,"" said Ghadirian, a McGill University professor who runs the SAD clinic at the Vic's Allan Memorial Institute. ""When they complain, they tell us they are in a sad mood."" Typically, patients feel lethargic, can't concentrate, sleep longer hours and eat more - ""women, especially, get a craving for carbohydrates and sweets,"" Ghadirian said. At the Douglas, staff psychiatrist Hani Iskandar also has received more calls this season from people with SAD symptoms, including a craving for chocolate and pasta. ""We have winter blues in Montreal, which is OK for most people - we're at latitude 45.5, where it is usually pretty light, not up north in some place like Kuujjuaq,"" said Iskandar, who specializes in mood disorders such as SAD and postpartum depression. ""But if it is repeated every year and people end up more confined to their beds, then that is what we call seasonal affective disorder.""

THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 1997 B5 Kew floods threaten in California Sun shines, but 'it looks like everything is ruined' ASSOCIATED PRESS MODESTO, Calif - Brilliant sunshine broke across Northern California yesterday as the surge of water pouring out of the mountains breached more levees and turned additional people into refugees. ""It looks like everything is ruined,"" said Marie Ferriere of Modesto, who hadn't been home since rising water from a week's worth of storms caused her to flee on Thursday. ""I try not to think about it. I want to go home, but I don't know if I have a home."" Many of the 125,000 people driven from their homes last week were returning as the state lifted older evacuation orders, state emergency official Steve Martarano said. In Marysville, 13,000 residents were told yesterday that they could leave shelters and trek back home. But many others got no such good news; some were told they might not be able to return home for as long as two months. And about 2,000 were ordered to evacuate during the night from the town of Meridian, along the Sacramento River near hard-hit Yuba City. Yesterday, Meridian residents and contractors raced to save an elementary school by bulldozing up a 6-foot-high, 3,000-foot-long earthen wall near the building. ""I've never seen anything like this. I've never heard of anything like this,"" said Sergio Aceves, a Sutter County employee working on the dike. Besides 3,000 people already ordered to evacuate in the Central Valley city of Modesto, authorities yesterday told residents to leave an additional 100 homes in the Weatherbee Lake area, emergency official Rex Osborn said. More farmland also disappeared beneath the muddy tide. As much as 40 inches of rain fell on the region last week, while rising temperatures melted dense snow in the Sierra Nevada, and snow and rain also devastated areas of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Nevada. California rivers continued surging yesterday as upstream dams were opened to make room in reservoirs for still more runoff water. President Bill Clinton had issued disaster declarations for large parts of California, Idaho and Nevada. Four deaths had been blamed on the flooding and storms in California, in addition to 15 in Washington and three in Oregon. One man was missing and presumed dead in Nevada. Sinking tanker sparks crisis in Japan, Russia NANETTE VAN OERLAAN LONDON DAILY TELEGRAPH MOSCOW - Japan sent a naval task force yesterday to fight an oil spill threatening fishing grounds after a Russian tanker split in two off the coast. An estimated 3,700 tons of heavy oil has leaked from the tanker and is heading for the main island of Honshu. Tokyo said any oil washed ashore would be a serious blow to the region, where shellfish and seaweed production are a major industry. The sinking of the tanker has also sparked a crisis in the Far East region of Russia, which was depending on the oil it carried to ease a severe energy shortage. High winds and seas caused the 26-year-old Russian tanker to split in two on Thursday. Thirty-one crew members were rescued by Japanese ships, but the captain is missing, believed dead. Rescue efforts were hampered at the weekend by stormy conditions and thick fog, and most of the vessel is now under water. The governor of Russia's Kamchatka region, Vladimir Biryukov, said all enterprises were barred from using fuel without permission and energy would be rationed. Electricity supplies are to be cut by 15 percent and homes will be heated for several hours a day only. Biryukov said that, even with rationing, energy supplies will last only until Jan. 12. The next tanker, carrying 30,000 tons of fuel, is not due to arrive until Jan. 17 or 18. Biryukov said he had asked Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to send emergency supplies.

Europe’s coldest spell in a decade claims 210 lives in 10 days More snowfalls in France DENIS DOYLE, AP The snow in Spain A young boy puts the finishing touches to a giant snowman he built in Madrid's Retiro park yesterday. Overnight snow fell as the cold weather affecting large areas of Europe swept across Spain. ASSOCIATED PRESS LONDON - Four camels brought into Britain shivered in blankets, French trains were diverted to pick up stranded skiers and German train stations opened to the homeless as more icy weather gripped Europe yesterday. The continent's coldest spell in a decade claimed another eight lives, bringing the total in the past 10 days to more than 210. In Britain, police recovered six bodies from snow and ice during the weekend, including the corpse of a 47-year-old woman last seen chasing after her dog in Dorset, southwest England, on Saturday. Sports were badly affected, with 52 horse race meetings and 39 big soccer matches canceled. Four camels brought into Britain on Dec. 26 from the Canary Isles by an entrepreneur hoping to introduce camel-trekking began their third week in southwest England wrapped in sleeping bags and blankets. Trains in France were diverted to get skiers home at the end of Christmas and New Year vacations. France's second week of freezing weather has killed nearly 30 people and knocked down phone lines. In southeastern France, where more snow fell yesterday, about 12,000 homes were without electricity and 5,000 without phones, France Info radio reported. Weather forecasters predicted a new blast of cold today. In Italy, a 51-year-old man had an arm and a leg ripped off when he slipped and fell under a train in rural Lombardy, northern Italy, on Saturday, the Italian news agency ANSA reported yesterday. The train dragged the man several yards outside the station where he lay in snow - which stemmed the bleeding and saved his life - until a railway worker found him at dawn yesterday. In Germany, the cold wave's death toll rose to about 40 during the weekend, including an elderly man who froze to death in an unheated, ramshackle house. After criticism by social workers, the German Federal Railways allowed homeless people to stay overnight in stations. At Frankfurt airport, icy weather meant 65 flights, mostly within Europe, were canceled yesterday.

Juniors shed tears at emotional meeting CANADIAN PRESS GENEVA - With 22 players from different teams in different leagues thrown together for a three-week run at a gold medal, team-building was a big part of Canada's world junior hockey success in Geneva. That included one group session at the team hotel in which players bared their innermost fears and troubles to their teammates. ""We had 22 guys crying,"" team captain Brad Larsen said. ""You can't share that with anyone. It was very personal and it brought everyone together."" Briere watch - Swiss observers had their eyes on Daniel Briere of the Drummondville Voltigeurs. The Swiss league likes to pick up skilled Canadian players deemed too small for the NHL and the 5-foot-9, 160-pound Briere looks made to measure. Briere, sometimes compared with Chicago's Denis Savard, was drafted in the first round, 24th overall, by Phoenix last spring. The speed and exceptional playmaking that made him arguably Canada's most dangerous forward in Geneva should let him survive in the rough-and-tumble NHL, but it's never certain with small players. Most scouts have suggested he's too small and lacks the sheer speed to make it in the NHL. Former Montreal Canadiens small forwards Stephan and Patrick Lebeau are among the former NHLers now starring in the Swiss league. Swiss teams kept an eye on forward Daniel Briere. Hair Loss?

ADDITIONAL REPORTING: PAUL WELLS OF THE GAZETTE OTTAWA BUREAU Allegations in Airbus affair first surface in 1994 book A chronology of the Airbus affair: 1988 - Air Canada buys 34 A-320 medium-range jets from Airbus Industrie, a consortium of French, German and British interests. 1989 - The RCMP investigates the deal, but later puts the file on hold. 1994 - A book by journalist Paul Palango says when the Airbus deal was made, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney put pressure on Air Canada to pay $5 million in consulting fees to a lobbying company owned by Frank Moores. Mulroney and Moores, a friend of Mulroney's and a former Tory premier of Newfoundland, deny the allegation. March 1995 - CBC-TV and a German newsmagazine suggest that Airbus might have paid secret commissions to Canadians to facilitate the sale, allegedly negotiated by German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber. The RCMP revives the investigation. Sept. 29, 1995 - The federal Justice Department and the RCMP write Swiss authorities for help, including a request to freeze bank accounts allegedly linked to the deal. The Swiss become involved after allegations that bribe money is stored in a Swiss account. Nov. 12, 1995 - Swiss TV reports that unnamed Canadian political leaders received commissions of about $20 million on the Airbus deal. Nov. 18, 1995 - Lawyers for Mulroney announce their intention to sue the federal government, RCMP and an official in the Justice Department after the Financial Post publishes details of the Sept. 29 Justice Department letter to Swiss officials alleging criminal activity by Mulroney. Nov. 20, 1995 - The Justice Department maintains that it made no accusations against anyone in its Airbus probe and merely followed normal procedures in its investigation. Mulroney's lawyers file a $50-million libel suit. April 17, 1996 - Mulroney tells a pretrial hearing that the federal government has permanently damaged his reputation. Later, federal lawyers lose a bid to delay proceedings by up to a year.

Sept. 11, 1996 - Mulroney's lawyers subpoena three reporters and an aide to Justice Minister Allan Rock. Nov. 30, 1996 - Government lawyers subpoena Norman Spector, Mulroney's former chief of staff. Dec. 1996 - William Thorsell, editor of the Toronto Globe and Mail; Luc Lavoie, Mulroney's spokesman; Philip Mathias, the Financial Post reporter who broke the story; Eddie Goldenberg, Jean Chretien's adviser, are all subpoenaed. Jan. 5, 1997 - An out-of-court settlement is reached. CANADIAN PRESS WEATHER Storm system began north of Lake Huron CONTINUED FROM PAGE A1 few hours because of slippery conditions, but most roads reopened in the afternoon as unseasonably mild weather melted any lingering ice. Only Highway 170, between Saint-Bruno and Chicoutimi, remained closed last night. The freezing rain also knocked out power at the Mont Tremblant ski resort in the morning, but the lifts were able to operate on auxiliary power. The weather, however, forced the cancellation of the Taschereau Cup junior-skiing race. ""It's a major letdown for us,"" said Tremblant resort official Yves Juneau. ""On a typical day, we get about 6,000 to 7,000 people on the slopes, and today we had fewer than 500."" The resort had to move skiers from the south side of the mountain to the north side because of strong winds and fog. A storm system that originated north of Lake Huron is responsible for the freezing rain. The 150-kilometre-long system moved across Quebec in a northeasterly direction, followed by a warm front. A total of 12 millimetres of precipitation fell on the Montreal area yesterday and the temperature reached 1.4 degrees Celsius. That's 7.5 degrees above normal. The temperature should rise to a high today of 2 degrees. The Sureté du Quebec reported fender benders but no serious road accidents. ""We had about 30 accidents across the province, including three that involved minor injuries,"" said Constable Mathias Tellier. Tellier said a heavy snowfall over a couple of hours usually causes more road accidents.

SAD Get more light, good food and exercise, specialists advise CONTINUED FROM PAGE A1 record,"" said Environment Canada meteorologist Martin Bartszak. November was a little more like normal: 77.5 hours, compared with the average 84.2. But like December, January shows little sign of brightening: so far this month, Montreal has got only half an hour of bright sunshine, when the average for this time of year is three hours per day. ""It is a little discouraging, I must admit,"" Bartszak said yesterday from his St. Laurent forecasting office. The sunshine itself is measured at a little monitoring station between runways at Dorval airport. Wait until Wednesday. ""We could use a - what do you call them - happy lamps? We could even use one here in the office,"" Bartszak said. ""I'm pale."" Montrealers will have to wait until Wednesday for more sunshine. The forecast calls for more clouds today and tomorrow, with snow flurries. Wednesday should be sunny and colder. In the meantime, specialists like Ghadirian advise people to brighten up their homes with artificial light, eat more nutritious foods and exercise more to keep their spirits up. Sufferers dose themselves. Both the Vic and the Douglas offer counselling for the worst cases of SAD, which is thought to affect 5 percent of the population between the end of summer and spring. Some sufferers end up buying a $195 ultraviolet-free lamp made in Montreal by Northern Light Technologies, and dosing themselves with high-intensity light.

He's tracking the best practices of various boroughs. As winter trends change, so does city planning LESS PLOWING, MORE SIDEWALK SALTING Montreal creates office to set standards, look at boroughs' most efficient efforts LINDA CYULAI GAZETTE CIVIC AFFAIRS REPORTER It isn't your imagination, Montreal winters have changed, the people who run snow-removal operations for the city say. And that means the city has to change the way it budgets for and executes snow removal to respond to a trend over the past few winters of less snow, more freezing rain and episodes of melting snow and refreezing, Montreal's snow head honcho, Yves Girard, said in an interview this week. Girard, who is in charge of the city's newly formed cleanliness and maintenance unit, said his office is studying the best practices of the 19 boroughs, from the type of salt spreaders they're buying to the blend of salt and gravel they use to the specifications in their snow-removal contracts. Each borough is still boss of its own snow-clearing operations, Girard said. But Mayor Gerald Tremblay's administration created Girard's office to establish standards. For instance, Girard's priority this winter is to get salt spread on sidewalks as fast as possible. The past two winters have been marked by freezing rain and cycles of unseasonably mild temperatures followed by sudden deep freezes. Girard's office also wants to better synchronize snow-clearing operations between boroughs along major public transit bus routes, he said. His office is also analyzing the boroughs' snow-clearing contracts, which are worth a combined $50 million. Should they still be based on 200 centimetres of snowfall? And most contracts expire March 15, even though snowstorms frequently occur after that date, he said. Ahuntsic-Cartierville borough has already started adjusting to the weather changes. The borough bought four new tractors designed to spread abrasives, borough spokesperson Marie-Elaine Ladouceur said. The borough has also created a snow-clearing unit that will attack snow as soon as it falls on streets where parking is always prohibited, like in front of schools, rather than wait several hours for public-works crews to put up no-parking signs across the borough before clearing any snow. ""It's so easy to say that you go in and clear the snow, spread some salt and it's over,"" Anie Samson, borough mayor of Villeray-St. Michel-Park Extension, said. ""But it's not like that anymore. The sidewalks are icy more often, chunks of ice block up sewers (and) it's hard to calculate whether it's best to spread salt or gravel or a mix because the temperature fluctuates so much."" Since you now get a mix of rain, freezing rain and snow in a single day, Samson said, the borough often spreads abrasives twice a day. The city also will have to rethink winter activities, Samson predicted. Her borough decided to forgo its February winter carnival after last winter's extreme temperature changes. She cited the number of outdoor skating rinks that have no ice this season as an example. ""We no longer have the winters we had 10 years ago,"" Igyulaithegazette, canwest.

CORDON BECK THE GAZETTE ve-Amelie Towner-Sarault (left), Claudia Sanche-Poulin, Kristy Franks, Nadia Ponce-Morales, Rachel Benoit and Isabelle Randria helped start the Canada World Youth Green Miles Project. Trees will not reach maturity—the seat to Nairobi can be offset by the planting of 20 trees. Over 20 years, those trees will absorb the atmospheric pollution generated by the participant's flight to Nairobi. ""The Green Miles Project is an optimistic, realistic solution,"" Franks said. ""There's a bigger picture than just this one seat on this plane. It's about making an effort."" The idea for the project was stimulated, in part, by the climate change conference held in Montreal in 2005. People from all over the world were coming to this city to talk about pollution and CWY decided to take action. Part of the organization's philosophy is promoting environmental sustainability. After CWY conducted an impact assessment during the summer of 2005, organizers found the majority of the pollution they generate was caused by air travel, one of the least environmentally friendly modes of transportation. So they decided to target the problem directly. Last year, when the green initiative was in its pilot-project phase, trees were planted on public and private properties across Canada by the travelling participants, who also raised the money to buy the trees. This year, the organization is trying to secure funding to implement the project more widely at home and branch out to plant trees in host countries. ""We need to be aware of the ecological footprints that we leave on the planet,"" Franks said, ""and we need to take action and be responsible for it.""

SUSAN KRASHINSKY THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 13, 2007 ""It's starting to look like winter will be something that comes and goes,"" jean-francois Grec SCRAPING UP SAVINGS Warmer weather has boroughs seeing green CITY SPARED COSTS OF SNOW-CLEARING But a few blizzards before the spring could melt cash savings, municipal officials warn. LINDA CYULAI GAZETTE CIVIC AFFAIRS REPORTER When the snowflakes are scarce, pennies drop from the sky. The lack of snow so far this winter has generated savings for Montreal's 19 boroughs. But there's no use in counting on a cash bonanza yet, borough mayors and public-works managers warned this week, as yesterday's rain and above-freezing temperature melted an early morning snowfall that had blanketed parts of the island. The four to five centimetres that accumulated temporarily was about as much snow as Mother Nature has been able to muster locally in one shot since the start of the season. On the other hand, it would take only a few blizzards to melt the savings and deplete the boroughs' combined $127-million snow-removal budgets this year, the officials said. ""I'm crossing my fingers that it continues like this without extreme changes,"" said Anie Samson, mayor of Villeray-St. Michel-Park Extension borough. ""But since it's extreme weather, we don't know what could happen. I'm worried."" The lack of snow is disappointing for the city's outdoor skaters and is fueling concern about climate change, but boroughs are hearing the ching-ching of savings ringing up as they close their books on the 2006 fiscal year, which ended Dec. 31. Ville Marie borough, which includes downtown and Old Montreal, estimates it saved $600,000 to $700,000 up to Dec. 31, spokesperson Jacques-Alain Lavallee said. The borough's 2007 snow budget is $8.75 million. But predictions for boroughs' 2007 budgets are as uncertain as a long-term weather forecast. The funds must last through the rest of this winter, plus November and December. Ville Marie's savings in 2006 were on payments to private companies, which handle half the snow removal, and on overtime for city blue-collar employees who do the other half, Lavallee said. Overtime costs shoot up during a snowstorm, as does fuel use, he said. The borough also saved on not having to call in blue-collar temps, as it usually does when the city has to dig out. On the other hand, the savings can only climb so high in any borough because of fixed costs, like employee salaries, orders for salt and gravel that get placed before winter, and minimum payment guarantees that are written into contracts with private snow-removal companies. Most boroughs contract out a portion of their snow-clearing work. Almost all contracts guarantee a minimum 50-per-cent payment. Boroughs base the contracts on 200 centimetres of snowfall and guarantee a minimum payment for 100 centimetres. For instance, the Southwest borough has $2.5 million in contracts with five companies and is committed to pay at least $1.25 million regardless of how much snow falls, said Ronald Cyr, the borough's manager of public works. The borough hasn't compiled final figures for 2006, but Cyr said it has probably saved about $100,000 on overtime for its 80 blue-collar employees and about $50,000 because it hasn't had to call in 20 temporary employees. As in other boroughs, Cyr said, Southwest's 80 permanent workers have been dispatched to do work normally done in spring, like cleaning streets, fixing roads and repairing benches and equipment. The story is similar for other boroughs: Cote des Neiges-Notre Dame de Grace: The borough has saved about $200,000, mayor Michael Applebaum said, and if the weather continues to be mild could save $500,000 on salting operations alone, and as much as $1.2 million overall on its $7-million snow budget. Applebaum already knows how he'll spend any savings. He'll funnel part of it into a snow reserve, in case the borough is short money during a future winter. The rest will be invested in services, Applebaum said. Plateau Mont Royal: The borough expects the weather relieved it of a chunk of snow-removal costs, spokesperson Marie-Eve Humbert said. But it is still calculating year-end figures. The Plateau, which spends DOM DE LA CATHEDRALS 514 282 9525 LAVAL (GALEMES LAVAL) 450 681 2202 KIWILAMO (CENTRE RIOCAN) 514 694 6276.

FLORA FOOLED INTO SPRING BEHAVIOUR Plants could suffer setback come April, May CHERYL CORNACCHIA THE GAZETTE The sap is running, magnolias are budding and crocuses are blooming in southern Quebec. It's definitely not like winter, but whether it's a welcome respite is debatable. Botanists and horticulturists caution that Montreal gardens could suffer later. Trees, shrubs and perennials are all being affected by the lack of snow cover and the warmer-than-usual temperatures. The full impact of this winter's wacky weather will only be known when spring arrives for real. ""Things are way too green,"" said Christina Idziak, curator at McGill University's Morgan Arboretum in Ste. Anne de Bellevue and a tree specialist. During a walk through the McGill tree sanctuary this week, THOMAS COEX AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES Skiers get a bird's eye view of green runs in Wengen, Switzerland, where warm weather forced the cancellation of a World Cup race yesterday. Warm weather dampens Europe's World Cup action Dandelions sprout on ASSOCIATED PRESS Wengen, Switzerland - At many ski resorts across Europe, there's more mud than snow. World Cup race courses are flanked by dead, brown grass. Tourists twirl umbrellas in the streets rather than clump around in ski boots. In France, it's been raining at an altitude of 2,500 metres and most ski resorts are below that. In Chamonix, France, one of the world's top ski destinations, the temperature this week reached 12 degrees Celsius. Only about 60 per cent of the resort's slopes are open. Lean on snow and unable to make more on its World Cup course because of mild temperatures, Chamonix was forced to hand over its races to another French resort, Val d'Isere. Less than 40 per cent of slopes were open at the posh resort of Gstaad, Switzerland - known as the Beverly Hills of the Alps. At Wengen - a World Cup host - this should change during the coming week, when much colder air is expected in southwestern Quebec. The Weather Network's forecast highs and lows for Tuesday and Wednesday are minus 12C/minus 26C and minus 17C/minus 17C, respectively. From Jan. 1 to Jan. 10, the average temperature at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport was 2.4 T -1.2 80.4 30.6 2.1 44.8 4.4 Figures are estimates T: Traces of snow Figures until Jan. 10 SOURCE: ENVIRONMENT CANADA leaves or straw atop a garden bed - protects garden plants. The mulch helps keep trees and other plants dormant through winter by keeping the soil cold and preventing roots from waking up and sending nutrients to branches, leaves and buds. In the absence of mulch, she said, snow cover does the job. This winter, however, many gardens have been without either. As a result, Atkinson said, some perennials, especially those that are not well established, could fail to come back in the spring. She said her Dorval neighbour's crocuses came up just before Christmas - ""blooms and all."" Although her spring bulbs have not done the same, she said, Atkinson continues to watch for signs of premature life in her primrose garden. ""All we can do is hope for the best,"" Atkinson said. Outside the city, after days of above-zero temperatures during the day and freezing temperatures at night, the sap is running. Serge Beaulieu owns 23,000 sugar maples in Ormstown 50 kilometres southwest of Montreal, who plans to tap his trees in mid-February as usual. But some of his neighbours have already begun tapping their sugar maples and will be boiling the sap this weekend, he said. ""I've seen that once or twice before at the end of January, but never mid-January,"" Beaulieu said. As for going to a sugar shack, sit tight, said Jean-Pierre Bellegarde, a spokesperson for Quebec's maple syrup industry and its 7,400 producers. Most people want to go to a cabane a sucre in March or April, not January or February, and Quebec sugar-shack owners have no plans to change the annual spring rite, Bellegarde said. The cabane a sucre is a place to say a sweet goodbye to winter, said Bellegarde, of the Federation des producteurs acericoles du Quebec. ""There's no desire to change that,"" ccornacchia thegazette, canwest.com. He stressed the current mild winter is not necessarily the result of global warming. ""Just as I'm not going to say that this proves climate change, a cold winter next year, if it happens, doesn't disprove it, either,"" he said. ""We need to look at the trends, the ensemble of events, the statistics of it."" Climate scientists have predicted Earth could heat up by anywhere between two to six degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century because of the greenhouse gases that trap heat from sunlight in the Earth's atmosphere. ""Just to put that in quick context, the difference between now and an ice age, when there was several kilometres of ice over this part of Canada, is about five degrees globally,"" McBean said. ""So we're talking about a temperature change in the next 100 years that is of the same order, perhaps larger, perhaps a little bit smaller than what we had going in and out of an ice age. That's a big difference, and it's happening in 100 years, not in tens of thousands of years.""

AN ALDERMAN'S COMPLAINT About the Blockades of Bleury Street. Alderman Jean D. Villeneuve Ward. The Alderman and the Foreman, The Road Committee met yesterday afternoon, there being present Ald. Prefontaine (chairman), W. Kennedy, P. Kennedy, J. B. Dufresne, Brunet, and Dubuc. After the usual routine business had been transacted, Ald. Jannotte introduced a deputation of St. Catherine Street property owners and stated their grievances. They had to complain that the sewer on St. Catherine Street, between Panet and Papineau Streets, was in bad order. It was made twenty-two years ago, and was insufficient for present purposes, as whenever there was a heavy rain the water flooded the cellars along the street, causing great damage. Ald. Dubuc spoke in favor of action being taken in this matter, and pointed out that a similar condition of affairs existed on Ontario Street, but he thought the Health Department should take the initiative. Ald. Jannotte pointed out that, as the new pavement was being laid on St. Catherine Street, this matter required immediate attention, so as to prevent the necessity of having to tear up the new pavement to build the sewer. On motion of the chairman, the affair was left to a subcommittee, consisting of Ald. Brunet, Dubuc, Wilson, and Mr. St. George, the city surveyor, who were to have authority to act in the matter. Then the aldermen engaged in a desultory chat, and as there was no sign of business, Alderman P. Kennedy made the suggestion that they adjourn and go to see the lacrosse match. Business was then temporarily resumed and Alderman Thompson was given a hearing, as he wanted to make a suggestion. He dwelt upon the unsatisfactory condition of the drains generally, and suggested that the committee recommend to the council that all matters relating thereto be left to a standing committee on drainage. In his opinion, not until this was done would the present unsatisfactory state of affairs be remedied. The Chairman, however, was of the opinion that there were too many committees who had to do with the streets and, as most of the aldermen agreed with him, no action on Ald. Thompson's suggestion was taken. A COMPLAINT. Aid. Cunningham was then allowed to speak with reference to the grievances of the business men on Bleury Street in regard to the drain now being made on that thoroughfare. He pointed out that last year the water pipes were laid on Bleury Street, thus blocking traffic and interfering with business; this year a drain was being made from St. Jacques Street to Dorchester and he understood that next year it was their intention to extend this to St. Catherine Street. He did not see, nor did the business men he had come there to represent, why the whole could not be completed this year, thus having the nuisance over and done with at once. No one saw any objections, and instructions were given for action accordingly. A CHARGE OF INCIVILITY. Aid. Villeneuve also had a complaint to make. He complained about the incivility of Foreman Rousseau, who had charge of the street improvements in St. Jean Baptiste Ward. He, himself, had only recommended one man to be taken on the works, but the foreman had returned his letter unopened. He had treated Dr. Germain most uncivilly, and whenever he (Aid. Villeneuve) met the foreman he turned his head and looked the other way, for fear he might be spoken to about some much-needed improvements. The sidewalks were in a most disgraceful condition; in fact, they had never been worse when the ward was a small village; and when Mr. Rousseau was spoken to about the matter he promised to do something, but never did it. No attention was paid to their remonstrances. Aid. Dubuc and Aid. Wilson defended Mr. Rousseau. Everybody spoke at once. Mr. St. George tried to obtain a hearing to defend Mr. Rousseau and explain to Aid. Villeneuve, but could not. The Chairman said there were grounds for complaint in regard to the condition of the sidewalks in St. Jean Baptiste Ward, but not more than in any other. This was not the question, however. Mr. St. George, being allowed to speak, said the sidewalks were in a bad condition, but they had no money to better them. Whenever Aid. Villeneuve asked for anything he put it down to compute the cost. He defended Mr. Rousseau, saying that he could not lay a sidewalk or repair one without coming to him (Mr. St. George) for instructions. Aid. Villeneuve: Let me interrupt you to let you know how matters stand. Mr. Rousseau stated to one of the assessors that St. Jean Baptiste should never have been annexed. Mr. St. George had stated the same thing himself, for the reason that when it was annexed the streets were in a very bad order and they had not since had the money for repairs. When Mr. Villeneuve saw the official statement he would be satisfied that the best possible had been done. Aid. Villeneuve with some animus reiterated his statements about Mr. Rousseau. """"I know,"""" he said, """"that he is the enemy of St. Jean Baptiste Ward."""" Mr. St. George warmly defended his foreman, saying he was a most efficient workman and it was most unfair to so abuse a man who had no chance of defending himself, and who, in doing as he did, had only acted under his (Mr. St. George's) orders. Aid. Villeneuve: He does not obey his orders. I would like Aid. Brunet, who lives near, to give me half an hour and I would convince him of the truth of my statements about the bad order of the sidewalks. Aid. Brunet was willing to make the examination and report to the Road Committee and let it report to the council. Aid. Villeneuve: We have been annexed five years and not a cent has been spent on seven streets. Then after all this talk had been talked and nothing done, Mr. St. George was instructed to inquire into Aid. Villeneuve's complaints. The Market Committee.

The highest flood which has been known in this section since 1850, with one exception, visited the valley of the Canisteo this morning. After a night of unusually hard rain at 8 o'clock this morning a third of the city was inundated. Crosby Creek was sweeping down Canisteo Street and covering the Erie yard. Canacadea Creek was overflowing, as was the river. The fire department was called out and did good work in securing bridges and buildings. The Erie is completely tied up, no through trains running since midnight, when train No. 6 went up the western division, but that has been stopped at Andover all day, unable to go either way. Three through trains have been lying at this city all day, one is at Addison and a fifth at Cameron, with no prospect of an opening before morning. It is now raining heavily and the streams are rapidly rising again, and unless it stops within an hour disastrous results will follow. Advices from Canisteo report that the village is completely under water and at the mercy of the stream. Almond and Alfred Centre are badly flooded and much damage has been done. Advices from Wellsville say that the water is unusually high at that place and all the bridges in that section are gone. At Corning many houses are surrounded and much damage done. The Northern Central has trouble at Watkins, where the tracks are flooded and washed out. ANOTHER RAILWAY HORROR. Albany, September 10. The passengers on the train known as the Steamboat Express, leaving Lake George at 4:50 p.m., had a narrow escape from a frightful catastrophe at the Lumber Street crossing on the Delaware & Hudson Railroad at 8 o'clock tonight. The engineer on the train noticed the danger signals and stopped his engine about 300 feet from the crossing. Shortly afterwards he was given the signal to go ahead and obeyed. At the crossing, however, owing to a misplaced switch, the passenger train was sent onto a track on which was standing an engine with steam up attached to a loaded freight train of thirteen cars. The passenger train clashed into the freight train, but beyond a general shaking up of the passengers no one was injured. The Steamboat Express always passes the Lumber Street crossing at a high rate of speed and had the train been stopped for some reason or other above the crossing, it would have run into the freight train with terrific force and a number of the passengers would have undoubtedly been killed.

supply not equal to demand, Considerable corn and oat shipping to Michigan; Provisions moderately active and irregular; closed steady; fluctuations largely in sympathy with corn, The Chicago wheat market was irregular, closing 2c higher October at $1.00, and 1c off November and December at $1.00, It will not be any day before the first arrivals of Labrador berries will reach this port, the Greenland having started for Dead Island to load about twelve days ago, The Sir Commodore followed a few days afterward for Labrador, Advance to state that the catch is good, THE STATE of TRADE, Although the volume of wholesale trade during the week under review has not been at all extensive, as was expected, against the feeling of cheerfulness and confidence coming to prevail in the commercial atmosphere owing probably to the caution excited in the upcountry and the almost entire neglect of trade, Among the most important features of the week, we note a decided improvement in dry goods, especially in the presence of a large number of Western customers, It is reported there to be 11 5c, and currents are very firm at 6c to 8c, Advice from Greece report that heavy rains poured all over the Peloponnesus on the 21st and 22nd nit, damaging the crop seriously and bringing about a real catastrophe, the currant crop there being the chief product, Half the crop was said to be exposed on the drying grounds, not more than 10,000 tons being housed prior to the rain, Since then telegrams report that after a short period of fine weather, heavy rain again set in and now we understand there is nothing to be had but ruin damaged fruit, the finest qualities going to other markets at high prices, The bulk of the rain-damaged crop will probably find its way to the French brandy districts, Valencia raisins are undoubtedly a large and fine crop, secured in splendid condition, but the influence of the currant maker has already been felt in Denmark where prices are thinning, recent cable quoting an advance of 1c per quintal, The first shipment of new Valencia have reached London and New York and the quality is highly spoken of, New crop Malaga have also been received in the same markets, The opening price of new lesson' prune was 20f, Bordeaux, the quality being one and got up in good condition, The tea trade has shown some improvement, owing to the fear of the Franco-Chinese trouble stopping the supply, Already several lots offered on English account have been withdrawn from this market, Small parcels of green have changed hands, and about 800 packages Japan dust at 8c to 9c, A lot of fine basket-fired Japan was also sold at 33c, Other sales were reported of Japan at prices ranging from 10c to 15c, There is a good enquiry for low grade, Coffee is quiet but prices are unchanged, Java are held steadily, owing to the damage of the crop to the Dutch East Indies, In tobacco there has been a rise of 1c to 2c per lb in block and bright, owing to the firm market at higher prices for leaf tobacco in the South, Spices are firm, white pepper being quoted at 4c to 25c, black do at 11c, pimento at 8c to 9c; unbleached ginger firm at 14c to 14.5c, and Cochin do at 11c, Rice, in sympathy with the advance in England and the prospective advance in freight which usually takes place at this season, is very stiff here and values are hardening, $1.00 to $1.41 now being the ruling rate at this quality, In canned goods the market is firm and advancing, and we quote prices at $1.75 to $1.80 per case for herring, and at $4.00 to $4.79 per case for mackerel, sardines are steady at 25c each for quarters, The sales of brandy have not been large during the past week as those reported for the week previous, although in a jobbing way they have been fairly satisfactory, Our buyers have also met with fair enquiry, the ordinary jobbing demand for sherry, champagne, and other wines being favorable, Reports from the French vineyards concerning the vintage expected during the past month indicate that the greater part of the demand done by the cold has been met, In fact, in many districts rain would be exceedingly beneficial, In B—, it is stated that the village on the Medoc will take steps to build, out of which one is already disposed of about $10,000 worth of goods, There is no change in prices, which are likely to remain steady, It is noted that some manufacturers report a steady business, while others find orders coming in rather slowly, Those manufacturers who supply the jobbing trade are still running on full time, Prices are steady, but there is a general complaint of small profits, We quote: Men's thick boots, waxed, $2.50 to $4;

Default,249,"THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JULY 7, 1882 WEEKLY REVIEW OF THE PRODUCE AND FUEL MARKET Montreal, July 7 There has not been much warm seasonable weather in this part of the Province, and the experience, on the whole, has been unequal, and this applies to the midsummer month so far as it has gone. Rain fell here on nine days during the first part of June, and on six days of the latter half; and only on two or three occasions has the temperature been up to a fair summer heat. July came in with heavy rain, which continued with more or less frequency until the 3rd inst, showers coming on again on the 5th and 6th. The highest temperature (74) of the past six days occurred on the 4th and 5th inst; the lowest (53) was on the 4th inst, the average daily mean being 61. Inquiries respecting the season's prospects in the Eastern Townships and part of Vermont and Maine have elicited information as follows: Country looks backward; cold weather and too much rain; hay crop on new meadows good, but light on old land; Indian corn and potatoes very backward; oats looking well; wheat considerably damaged in some sections, by wire worm. Notwithstanding very unfavorable weather in some of the Western States, crop prospects are said to be fair. Business has been interrupted this past week by holidays, Dominion Day falling on Saturday, and the United States national holiday on Tuesday. Latest advice from Europe were by Atlantic cable to date; by mail per S.S. Peruvian and Parthia, dates from London, Liverpool and Glasgow being to 24th ult.

Total shipments from 1st January to 5th July, 219,600 brls, against 227,607 brls at corresponding date in 1881, being an increase of 11,933 brls. Business since the holidays has much improved, and a considerable quantity of flour has changed hands this week, some 2,000 brls being on lower ports account. Superiors have sold at $6.25, $6.22, $6.20 and $6.17; extra superior (which is specially in demand) at $6.05, $6.00 and $6.05; spring extra at $5.80, $5.90 and $5.96, and superfine at $5.25.

IN CARNIVAL AT OTTAWA Was formally opened yesterday by Sir James Grant. THE WEATHER WAS NASTY It rained nearly all the afternoon and poured all night. The Shamrocks defeated the Electrics. From our own correspondent, Ottawa, January 21. The clerk of the weather has not been kind to the Ottawa Winter carnival. A cold mixture of rain and sleet has been falling all this afternoon and evening and the streets are in such slippery condition that walking is not only difficult, but dangerous. Nevertheless, the carnival has opened with considerable éclat and indications are that it will prove a great and unqualified success. The decorations are exceedingly good and the electric display is far ahead of anything hitherto attempted in Canada, and probably excels that of any other city in this or any other continent. Sparks and Bank streets have been converted into fairyland. Thousands of colored incandescent lights are strung across the streets. Almost every building on the two thoroughfares is decorated with banners, streamers and flags are flying everywhere. The cars each carry 21 colored lights and as they flash along the streets the effect is very beautiful. The cold drizzle has had a depressing effect, but nothing short of a second deluge could dampen the ardor of people who have thronged the streets all day and are still trudging about tonight despite the icy sidewalks and the chilly wind. The formal opening of the festival took place shortly after two o'clock, when the president of the Carnival committee, accompanied by Sir Adolphe Caron, Hon. Jno. Haggart, Hon. Jno. Costigan, Hon. C. Rooms. There was not a very large attendance at any of the sports owing to the inclement weather. Rain fell all night, and walking was next to impossible. At Dey's rink the Shamrock team of Montreal covered themselves with glory by defeating the unconquered Electrics a second time. The score was 5 to 1. In the first half both teams scored once, but in the second half the Shamrocks played all round the Electrics. The teams were as follows: Shamrocks: Electrics - Mobile (goal), Hliua, Klyfe, Point, Nolan, Steven, Cover point, Murphy, McOulsten, Forwards: Murphy, Fairbairn, """"I"""" Wall, """"Baldwin, Brown, """"O'Neill.

MONTREAL RECORD observations taken at McGill College Observatory January 23, time 9:00 29, I, Tarte present to correct the statement that Mr Justice Mathieu has decided on this point, The question had never before been raised in this form, When Mr Tarte arrived he explained the facts to him, and the latter affirmed that what Mr Crankshaw called the scum-laden article of the Herald was true in all particulars, and in effect gave the lie to the revising Barrister, finally he apologized for his statements, An appeal may be taken by Mr Maclennan, Maclennan, A Street Railway Communication, To the Editor of the Gazette: Sir, In the matter of the Street railway and salt, Montreal seems to be in just as bad a plight as St John, but in Ottawa, where the use of salt is prohibited, there seems to be no trouble, The following would appear to be a way of getting over any trouble there may be, and keeping the streets in good condition for sleighing, Let the car company provide a tank car, something such as they use in Toronto for summer street watering, and beside, with perhaps rollers, hangers and ice cutting plough, to cut the ice down at the rails and round the surface up between and at each side, Instead of salting the street promiscuously let them water the snow when the thermometer is well below freezing, Once having brought the surface into proper shape it would last well, the plough would clear it easily, and the snow would not be continually working back on the rails, As it thawed it could from time to time be built up again by a further watering on cold nights, J, dissenting, Mowub (defendant in court below), appellant, and Malo (plaintiff in court below), respondent The appeal was from a judgment which condemned the appellant to pay the respondent the sum of $134, Wurtele, J, giving the judgment of the court, said that appellant was the owner of three cottages at Longueuil, They had been damaged by the ice, and he was desirous of having the damage repaired, He asked de Martigny if he knew anyone who could repair the houses for him, They went over to Longueuil together, and Ferland, a contractor, said the work could be done for $150, Ferland stated afterwards that he meant $150 per house, De Martigny told appellant the work could be done for $150, and appellant instructed him to go on and get it done, He thereby constituted de Martigny his agent for the repair of the three houses, De Martigny told Ferland to do the work, There was no contract, Ferland ordered lumber from the respondent De Martigny gave respondent a note for the amount of his account When it became due, it was not paid, Malo took an action against de Martigny and obtained judgment, but there was a return of nulla bona, Malo then sued appellant and obtained judgment against him, and the appeal was from this judgment, The question was whether the principal was liable under the circumstances, The majority of the court were of opinion that article 1710 of our code, which states that a mandatary who acts in his own name is liable to the third party with whom he contracts without prejudice to the rights of the latter against the mandator also, governed the present case, The judgment of the court below was therefore well founded, and it was maintained, Blanchet, J, dissenting, Lonnitrs (defendant in court below), appellant, and DomoN (plaintiff in court below), respondent, The judgment appealed from maintained an action by respondent and awarded him the sum of $100 for the loss of four fingers of his left hand, Respondent was employed in appellant's shop, and while planing a piece of wood on a planing machine, the accident occurred, It was contended by the appellant that the accident was due wholly to respondent's negligence; that the machine was in perfect order, and that a guard was attached to it for the protection of the workmen, and that if this guard was not on the machine at the time, respondent could easily have obtained it The court was unanimously of the opinion that the judgment could not be sustained, The weight of evidence was to the effect that the accident occurred through respondent's carelessness in using the machine without the guard, in disobedience of the directions given to him, He was a skilled workman and accustomed to the use of the machine, and knew the danger of using it without the guard, The judgment was therefore reversed and the action dismissed, CORPORATION OF THE VILLAGE OF DUNHAM (defendant in court below), appellant, and Garick (plaintiff in court below), respondent, The appeal was from a judgment rendered by the Superior Court in the district of Bedford, condemning appellant to pay respondent $75 damages suffered by him while driving a vehicle on the highway, While passing over a small bridge the horses took fright and the vehicle went over the edge of the bridge, and respondent was injured, The question was whether the appellant was bound to provide hand-rails to make the bridge safe, The court below maintained the action, and this decision was unanimously confirmed by the Court of Appeal, CIKMAN (defendant in court below), appellant, and Jkhomk (plaintiff in court below), respondent The appeal was from a judgment which maintained respondent's action and condemned appellant to pay $200 and interest, The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, Blanchet, J, dissenting, Davidson et al, (defendants in court below), appellants, and Thiemhlay (plaintiff in court below), respondent This was another case of employer's liability, The judgment condemned appellants to pay respondent $2,000 damages alleged to have been sustained by him by reason of the death of his minor son, caused by an accident while in appellants' employment The court was of opinion that the weight of evidence was against the appellants, The presumption of negligence was against them from the fact that the law was not complied with as respects covering the belt and providing guards for the machinery, After reviewing the facts of the case, the court came to the conclusion that the judgment should not be disturbed, and it was confirmed in all respects, Coohi, in (defendant in court below), appellant, and Pake (plaintiff in court below), respondent, Hall, J, said that the action was by a proprietor against his tenant, The roof of the building occupied by the tenant fell in, According to respondent's pretension the accident occurred owing to the weight of snow on the roof, The roof was repaired by the proprietor, now respondent, and the present action was to recover the cost The rule of law was that the tenant is responsible unless he can show that the injury resulted from no fault on his part The court did not think that the tenant in this case had proved that the injury occurred without any fault of his, The evidence showed that there was a large quantity of snow upon the roof, and the court was of opinion that this accumulation of snow was the primary cause of the accident, The tenant was in default to remove the snow and, under the circumstances, the judgment of the Court of Review, which held the tenant responsible, was well founded, and it was confirmed, The Chief Justice stated that judgment in the case of Drysdale and Dugas would not be rendered at present, It would, perhaps, be given on Thursday, In the afternoon the hearing of the case of Wineberg, appellant, and Hampson, respondent, was commenced, Messrs Green Shields, Q A LONDON STORY, The under and I, luhli, ing, Know, Hitil huh Buanhtue in Three Hours, London, January

Default,252,"THE BLOCKADE RAISED The railway traffic which has been demoralized for some days past on account of the heavy snowstorm is again resuming its normal condition The block on the intercolonial has been raised and the first mail from the lower provinces for a week was distributed last night Ten engines and snow ploughs were employed clearing the track Mr Daley, the Dominion immigration agent, received the following telegram yesterday morning from Campbellton, N.U. Johnson, J. This was an action of damages against the railway company brought by the widow and children of the late Norman McDonald for having, by the fault and negligence of the company, caused the death of the husband and father, and a most distressing case in itself of course it is, though, unfortunately, what distresses and disturbs does not tend to give any one a clearer view of their right under the law This young man, now dead, and leaving behind him a young widow and several children, who say the railway company are responsible for his death, left his house on the morning of the 5th of April, 1886, and went with another man called Donald Smith, and a pair of horses and a sled to the woods where they loaded up with some heavy logs, and started thence to draw them to the saw mill, having on their route to cross the railway track, which they reached without much difficulty, though the snow in some places had disappeared The load was drawn up the incline onto the track, which was bare of snow; but there it stuck, and the horses could get it no further The train came down rounding a curve towards the spot where the sleigh had stuck on the track; and there is evidence that if the engine driver had shifted his seat from the convex to the concave side of the curve he might have seen the obstruction somewhat sooner; but it was a downgrade at that place; and he only succeeded in stopping the engine after it had struck the loaded sleigh The unfortunate man MacDonald would have had time to save himself, by getting out of the way after he saw the train coming, for he and his load remained on the track some ten minutes; but he put himself most unfortunately where he would have been in all probability sure to suffer if his load should be struck by the engine; and accordingly, when it was struck, it was dashed with tremendous force against him, and he was killed The action in the usual form alleged negligence and fault on the part of the company with all the other necessary allegations required by the circumstances; and particularly set forth that the accident was a direct consequence of the bad condition of the railway crossing which the company were bound by law to keep so that the rails should not be more than one inch above or below the level of the road, while they were alleged to be eleven inches above the level The conclusion was for $20,000 The defendants pleaded, first, an express denial of each of the allegations of the plaintiff, and they further pleaded contributory negligence by the deceased himself in respect of the bare state of the roads, the weight of the load, and the weakness of the horses; and that the deceased had resided close by, and knew when the train was due; and in spite of all this attempted imprudently to cross the track; that the bell was rung and the train was stopped as soon as possible; that it was running at an ordinary rate, and on time; and the deceased with common caution could have escaped, but placed himself behind his load so as inevitably to bring about his own death The issues of fact were tried at Sherbrooke by a jury, and they found on the evidence that there had been no fault or negligence on the part of the defendants; but that there had been negligence on the part of the deceased, to which his death was directly attributable This is the effect of the finding of the jury; and the plaintiff on the ground that it is against the evidence, moves for a new trial The several questions (thirty-four in number) submitted to the jury cover every fact of importance that can bear upon these two main points, viz: the fault and negligence of the defendants, and the fault and negligence of the deceased; and the principal particulars of negligence urged against the defendants were the level of the rails being above the legal limit; and the fault of the engine driver in not stopping sooner The jury found both against the plaintiff's pretensions, and though they were particularly told, as to the latter point, that if the engine driver could have stopped sooner by doing anything he had omitted to do, they found clearly in answer to the 23rd, 24th, 25th, and 26th questions, that everything was done that could have been done; the bell was rung; and whether the driver had seen a few moments sooner or not would have made no difference on that descending grade With respect to the level of the rails, the law cited is in the statute 42 Vic, ch. 9 sec. 15, subsections 2 and 4 The provisions are very clear and easily understood It provides that on the highway or right of passage over the track to which the public is entitled, the rails must not be more than an inch above or below the level of the way, and as I understand the evidence, that was proved by the defendants' witnesses It is true that there was evidence on both sides The friends of the deceased on the one side, who made no measurements; the witnesses for the defendants on the other, who did take precise measurements, and it cannot be said, if the jury was to estimate and weigh the value of the evidence on both sides, that they have found against evidence by saying in effect that they prefer the proof of the defendants on this point to that of the plaintiff It was their right to say so; and I must say I agree with them The fourth subsection, which was altered by the second statute, does not affect the case at all Then, on the other issue, viz, the want of care and prudence in this poor man who met his death, this subject was spread over several questions, and the jury found in answer to the seventeenth and eighteenth, that the road was bare of snow and the men were driving a heavy load for such roads; and in answer to the twenty-first, that the deceased was familiar with the crossing and knew the time the train was due Besides this the jury found in their answer to the twenty-seventh question, in the most direct manner that McDonald was guilty of rashness, recklessness and imprudence in attempting to cross the railway at that particular time of the day and season of the year; and to the twenty-eighth they say also with equal plainness that the deceased did, by his own acts and negligence, contribute to bring about his own death It could not be maintained; it was not argued, I believe, that on this last part of the case (the fault of the man himself), the jury had found against evidence Therefore, upon the whole case, we are obliged to say the verdict should stand The plaintiff sued in forma pauperis, and the defendants, of course, though they have the right to judgment for costs, will not, we hope, exercise it under the circumstances David vs. La Compagnie de Jurisprudence et al Johnson, J. This was an action of damages for libel The defendant's journal, Le Monde, published in a paragraph on the 9th October that, on the day before, in the plaintiff's presence, he being then a candidate for Parliament, a sum of $2,000 had been offered to one Lemay, a supporter of the other candidate, Mr. Gravel, to get the latter to retire and so secure the vote of the workingmen for the plaintiff The judgment went against the printing company only, and exonerated the editor and manager personally The company now inscribes: It had pleaded to the action that the article was published in good faith and was true, and published for the public benefit If it meant anything it meant that an act of corruption was committed before the plaintiff's face, for his benefit, and with his approval The proof did not sustain that at all, but something very different and which in no way reflected discredit on the plaintiff The judgment gave $200 on damages There cannot be the slightest doubt that the defendants did not prove what they pleaded, the offer of the money for the purpose they had said They admitted the publication, and of course damages were due, but we are in reality asked to reduce the damages, that is all No pretext whatever was suggested for such a step on our part, it is not a matter of fancy or arbitrary will We have no right to touch a judgment of the court without a sufficient reason, and none whatever is alleged Judgment confirmed O'Connor vs. Grand Trunk Railway Co Johnson, J. The trial of the issues of fact in this case was had before a special jury: and they found unanimously a verdict which on the face of it clearly entitles the defendants to judgment dismissing the plaintiff's action; and accordingly they move for judgment in their favor; but the plaintiff comes with a motion for a new trial on grounds of misdirection, admission of illegal evidence, and of verdict rendered without evidence, and contrary to evidence The point of misdirection was not heard, as there was nothing of record as required by law to show what the direction was Therefore, the points are reduced to the evidence and the rulings at the trial The action was to recover $896 as the alleged value of a quantity of railway ties which the defendants were alleged to have permitted to be put where they were afterwards consumed by fire, attributed to their fault and negligence The defendants denied any such permission, and any such neglect or fault on their part, and said, on the contrary, that the plaintiff put his ties on the property of the railway at his own risk; and was in fact a trespasser, and had no right of action against them, if his ties were destroyed And further, the defendants pleaded that before action brought, the plaintiff had waived and discontinued his pretensions The plaintiff made answer to that part of the plea, denying all permission to him to place his ties on their property by setting up an alleged custom of the people about there, who had ties to sell, of placing them alongside the track on the railway property, and alleged that the defendants had acquiesced in such a custom The real issues for the jury were three: First the permission, secondly the fault of the defendants, and thirdly the waiver; and these questions were amplified and diluted into a number of minor particulars, according to the practice The jury found that there was no permission, and no custom of the kind that was set up They also found there was no fault or negligence by the company; and thirdly, they found the plaintiffs had withdrawn and waived, before they brought their action, all their claims arising out of this matter The plaintiff contends now that he proved this usage He cannot contend, of course, that he proved a permission, for the evidence is in the teeth of such a pretension There was evidence on the subject no doubt, but it did not satisfy the jury, that it amounted to a custom known to and tolerated by the defendants, still less assented to, or binding upon them A few persons may have had the bad habit of trespassing in this manner, as a few fools will still continue to jump on trains in motion, but neither in the one case nor in the other is the """"custom"""" so called, one in which railway companies can be assumed to participate without more distinct proof than there has been in this case The next issue was the fault and negligence of the defendants in setting fire, of course, the defendants as a railway company, will have some difficulty in running their trains, unless they may lawfully use fire to raise steam for their engines, and within the limits of their own property, I do not see that anyone can complain if he chooses to come without their permission, and, so to speak, bring with him a bundle of sticks, and poke them into the fires in use on the line if the sticks should be burnt up Therefore, unless the finding on this head were shown to be against evidence, we are not held to go any further into the other points, but may properly say the burning of wood placed on the railway property close to their track without any permission, express or implied, gives no right of action against the company, but is a thing occurring entirely by the fault of the person who put the wood there in a place exposed to fire But in point of fact the findings as to the defendants' negligence, or even as to the cause of the fire, excluding the idea of their negligence, are all in accordance with the proof, as the jury had a right to appreciate that proof There was circumstantial evidence that the fire might have come from the defendants' engines; there was a probability of such a thing in the absence of any other assignable cause, and the jury were so told by the court; but the fact was entirely within their province, and they found against the plaintiff; they found there was no proof, and unless we can say what is the precise amount of proof that ought to satisfy a jury one way or the other, it is impossible to find fault with the verdict in this particular; otherwise it is no longer a trial of the facts by a jury, but by the court But this circumstantial evidence of the possibility or probability of the cause of the fire was met by a most complete and careful, I may add, scientific evidence to show that that particular engine could not, on the two days alleged, have set the fire All that would remain would be the question of waiver, It is with respect to the admission of evidence on this head that the ruling at the trial is complained of; but it is unnecessary to proceed to that part of the case, either as regards the facts or the law, since the evidence of absence of permission or custom, and that of fault or negligence on the defendant's part amply sustains the findings on those points, and fully disposes of the case I ought, perhaps, to cite, in view of the abuse of the motion for new trial in almost all jury cases in this court, an authority of the highest description that ought to serve to mitigate the indiscriminate infliction of them except in cases resting on distinct principle It is the case of the Metropolitan Railway Company vs. Wright, decided last year in the House of Lords, and it is Lord Selborne's judgment What concerns the case in hand is this: """"In many cases the principles on which new trials should be granted on the ground of difference of opinion which may exist as to the effect of the evidence, have been considered both in the House of Lords and in the lower courts; and have always understood that it is not enough that the judge who tried the case might have come to a different conclusion from the jury, or that the judges in the court where the new trial is moved for might have come to a different conclusion; but there must be such a preponderance of evidence, assuming there is evidence on both sides to go to the jury, as to make it unreasonable and almost perverse that the jury, when instructed and assisted properly by the judge, should return such a verdict If this is the law of trial by jury we cannot properly interfere with this case The jury were unanimous and no injustice appears Therefore the plaintiff's motion is dismissed and the defendants' motion for judgment is granted with costs (To be Continued) ENJOY LIFE What a truly beautiful world we live in!

Default,253,"Arrival of the new Governor A stormy voyage Heavy snow storm St John's, October 6 The royal mail steamer Nova Scotian, Captain Richardson, arrived at seven o'clock this morning, having been detained two days on her voyage from Queenstown by uninterrupted gales of westerly and northwesterly winds. During the whole voyage westward the deck of the steamer was not dry for one hour. The new Governor for Newfoundland, recently nominated by the Queen, Sir Henry FitzHardinge Maxse, came passenger by the Nova Scotian. During the past sixteen years he administered the government of Heligoland. Throughout the Crimean war he was aide-de-camp to Lord Cardigan and was engaged in the famous charge of the Light Brigade. The then Lieutenant Maxse was one of those who came back when """"not the six hundred,"""" but he came back wounded. For his bravery he received from his sovereign several badges and decorations and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was enthusiastically received this morning and was escorted by the cavalry and infantry, constabulary of the city and by detachments from Her Majesty's steamers in port to the viceregal residence. Flags were displayed on all the public buildings and the shipping in the harbor was gaily and profusely decorated with bunting. The British steamship Juliet, Captain Williams, master, owned by Bowring Bros of Liverpool, arrived at this port early on Thursday. The Juliet is on a voyage from Dundee, Scotland, to New York, laden with iron and a general cargo of bale goods. She has on board fifty passengers for the United States. The passage from Dundee to St John's occupied twelve days and is pronounced by Captain Williams to have been boisterous beyond all his former lengthy experience on the Atlantic. From the time of leaving Dundee until last night the wind blew a tremendous gale, varying from west-southwest to northwest, but abating not one jot in violence. In fact, the Juliet may be said to have been under water for ten complete days. On Thursday last, when the storm was at its height, the sea crashed in through one of the port side-lights and carried everything before it. A poor lady passenger was dashed to leeward and had her skull fractured. She was landed this morning in a dying state with a coffined child that succumbed last night to its sufferings. A furious gale of west-northwest wind blew over the west coast of Newfoundland last night, accompanied by a driving snow. The frost was very slight. The snow fell to a depth of seven inches. The range of the gale was from St George's Bay to Bonne Bay. Sports and Pastimes MONTREAL The unpropitious weather for the last three Saturdays has certainly not been conducive to outdoor sports; however, the Hunt is to be congratulated on the large attendance of its members each day, and despite the downpour on Saturday last, the turnout of mounts was the largest of the season, including for the first time four ladies, a fact we were glad to notice, for we had begun to wonder if the fair sex, who in years gone by used to grace the field, were to have no successors. The Meet, which was to have been at Summerhill, the country seat of Mr. Hickson, was changed to Cote des Neiges, on account of that gentleman's absence in England, and the Hunt are indebted to Mr. Baumgarten and Mr. Paton for a capital breakfast at Lumkins, under the charge of Messrs. Hall & Scott, whose names are a sufficient guarantee that everything was as it should be. When the horn sounded we recognized the following ready to start: Mrs. Blackwood, Mrs. B. Davis, Mrs. Brice, Miss Ogilvie, Mr. Crawford, Dr. Hings-ton, Mr. Baumgarten, Mr. Galarneau, Mr. A. Stuart, Mr. Stevenson, Mr. Hutchins, Mr. K. A. Whitehead, Mr. Gault, Mr. Strathey, Mr. Stephens, Mr. Staufield; those in carriages were Mr. Esdaile, Mr. H. Paton, Mr. and Mrs. Riley of Boston, Mrs. Hutchins, Mr. Wolfe, Capt. Milburn, Mr. B. Campbell, Mr. A. White of Quebec, Capt. Shepherd, A.D.C., Capt. Ritchie, S.S. Peruvian, Mr. Harper, Mr. Stick of Swansea, and Mr. Magniao of England, whom we learned was a master of a fine pack at home. The coverts below Snowdon's farm were tried, and soon not one, but it seemed, a litter of foxes were found. For three or four hours the hounds and riders were kept on the move from one covert to the other. Those on foot viewed the foxes several times crossing the small open between the coverts; in fact, so rank were """"the varmint"""" that an unfortunate skunk got mixed up and was earthed by the stopper. The proprietors in the neighbourhood ought to be much obliged to the Hunt for their visits, to rid them of the enemies of their hen roosts, instead of stopping some of the members, as they did on Saturday, and demanding money for the damage done to a few fences. The Hunt are always most willing to repay the farmers for any damage that may be done to their property. LATEST NEWS The Grand Jury on Saturday brought in a true bill against Guiteau. Sir Henry Maxse, the new Governor of Newfoundland arrived at St John's on the 6th by the Nova Scotian. Workmen in the Staffordshire potteries have demanded increased wages from the 1st of November, which the masters have resolved to resist. The strike which is threatened in consequence will affect upwards of 80,000 men. Hartmann, the supposed Nihilist, has returned to Europe from the United States. A Tunis despatch says French officers have been put in command of the Tunisian regiments under Ali Bey. Snow to the depth of seven inches fell in Newfoundland last week. King Alfonso of Spain is to be invested with the Order of the Garter. General Pendergast is to supersede Blanco as Captain-General of Cuba. Sensational rumours are telegraphed of an intention to annex Turkey to Austria and Russia. The French have occupied all the Tunis forts, and 2,000 men now lie at the city's gates. The Austrian Minister of Justice has brought a bill before the Chambers to allow the marriage of Jews with Christians. Dominion News FROM OTTAWA An important enterprise is now under way which will replace the lost one of the Ohio Company, that for a year and a half past worked the Forsyth Iron Mines in Hull township. Mr. Lawless has leased lot No. 13, 7th concession of the township of Hull, to a company of American capitalists for a period of five years. The Lawless property lies adjacent to the Forsyth Baldwin mines, and the mine opened proves to be most rich and promising. Although papers were only signed yesterday, 10 tons of ore were taken out with the appliances at hand, under the superintendence of Captain Timmons, who was recently in the employ of the company which worked the Forsyth mine. New mining machinery has been ordered from New York, and work will be pushed forward during the winter. The company have agreed to pay 40c per ton royalty, with the privilege of buying the property, which comprises 100 acres, any time for $100,000. The ore will be sent to the States to be manufactured into pig iron. Mr. Blanchard of New York is President of the company, which has started the enterprise, and Dr. Carpenter of New Jersey, the Treasurer. The capitalists interested belong to New York, Jersey City and Boston. Mr. Hale, Engineer-in-Chief of the Canada Atlantic Railway, and the Duffy party will remain in this section a week or more. Three distinct lines will be run into this city from Hurdman bridge locality and the most feasible line adopted. A line will also be surveyed from the city station grounds to the Chaudiere, so that connection with the saw mills can be made, as the transport of lumber is one of the greatest objects for which the railway is being built. It is the purpose of intending contractors to examine the route of the Toronto & Ottawa Railway between Sharbot and Lake Madoc before tendering. A number are expected in the town shortly with that object. Work in Maberly goes briskly on. The contractors are now going through a heavy cut, and after that they will be engaged in a deep fill. The work seems to go on vigorously, and although the gang is small they intend to enlarge it as soon as they come to more sand excavating. There is a large number of men now clearing the right of way on the south side of the village. Tomorrow morning, Mr. Murray Mitchell, with a staff of three engineers and twelve men, leaves to survey the route of the proposed Gatineau Valley Railway between Hull and the Desert, about one hundred miles north of this city. This road will run through what was once thought to be a barren waste, but experiments have proved it to be not only very rich in phosphate and iron, but from an agricultural point of view. Work is now being done on four new lines centering at Ottawa, the New York, Waddington-Ottawa Railway, the Toronto & Ottawa Railway, the Canada & Atlantic, and Gatineau Valley Railway. Besides these projects, there will be Pontiac & Pacific Railway, or the extension of the Y.M.",1,18811010,historical,snow,0,0,0,0,0,0,

As soon as the papers in the various branches upon which he was to be examined had been placed before him, he hastily copied them on a sheet of paper, took an apple from his pocket, and cutting out the core, he introduced the paper into the fruit. He then coolly opened the window, apparently for the purpose of obtaining fresh air, and threw the apple with the questions to a young member of the bar outside, the intention being to have it returned with the answers. Unfortunately, the trick was detected, and the candidate who had perpetrated it was consequently plucked. The snowstorm was one of the severest experienced for some years. The delay to the trains. The snowstorm which commenced on Thursday night and continued without intermission all day yesterday had the effect of delaying trains in all directions. No information could be gleaned from the officials at the Bonaventure depot, but the following appeared on the blackboard: No. 1, West, due at 8:30 p.m., 1 hour and 15 minutes late; No. 7, Ottawa, due at 11:30 a.m., 9 hours and 30 minutes late; No. 10, C.V.R., 8:40 p.m., 2 hours late; South Eastern, due at 8:30 p.m., 2 hours late; No. 4, East, due at 8:12 p.m., cancelled. So far, this winter has been exceptionally hard as far as snowstorms are concerned. Yesterday's snowstorm was declared to be the heaviest of the season, and the railway officials fear that traffic will be seriously impeded. At an early hour, the storm had not caused much delay to the service, but as the snow fell steadily the whole day and evening, accompanied by a blizzard in the country, there is every likelihood of a block occurring. The number of farmers who arrived in the city yesterday was small, notwithstanding that it was market day. The few who did face the terrific storm complain bitterly of the trouble experienced in reaching the city, owing to the heavy roads and blinding storm, and state that it is the worst they have been subjected to for several years past. The storm evidently prevailed throughout the whole province. Dr. de Jongh's Light Brown Cod Liver Oil. In consumption, its efficacy is unequalled.

Hitkpre- 482½ II 4JAKAU4N NM'lfHITIKN IUKIN THE PAST YEAR. For the first time since this Journal was established now nearly four years, the financial retrospect usual at this season yields almost unalloyed satisfaction. A comparison with this time last year shows that, with rare exceptions, pre-existing securities have advanced in value in some cases very considerably and there has been, we are glad to say, no fresh instance of default or disgrace. As compared with what could be said of Australia or South America, but little new work has, however, been done. No Government issue of any kind has been made: Dominion, Provincial, or municipal. On account of railway companies, the principal operation was the issue in April last of the balance of the Canadian Pacific railway bonds. That company's Manitoba Southwestern bonds have also been placed this year, chiefly, however, in Amsterdam. The Manitoba and Northwestern Railway company have also got their bonds into the market. The Island of Anticosti company has been floated during the year, and bonds have been issued on behalf of the City of Winnipeg Water Works company and the Halifax Graving Dock company. The three defaulting railway companies are practically as they were a year ago. The Montreal and Sorel bonds issued in April 1883 at 97 are now quoted 12 to 16, and are probably worth nothing at all, except as voting counters. Quebec Central are considered to have some prospects, and they are quoted 29 to 32, which is 3 higher than the price of a year ago. Newfoundland railway bonds are quoted 40 to 46, and may be dealt in at that, for, though interest is in default, there is every prospect, we think, of sooner or later some settlement being come to with the Newfoundland Government. If the committee of bondholders are willing to deal fairly with the Government, who, it should be borne in mind, have been greatly injured under the concession, they may at any time, we believe, get equitable terms. As to the improved market value of Canadian securities known in Great Britain, there is much to be said. Dominion 3½ per cents are as much as 6 higher, having risen from 92¼ to 98¼. Provincial Government bonds have as a rule improved, but the older 6 per cents are naturally inclined to lose some of their considerable premiums, as the redemption dates come to be thought more of. Of municipal bonds, those of Quebec and Toronto show a rise of about 3 percent, but Toronto's credit is a long way ahead of that of any other Canadian city. But the most considerable advance is in railway securities. All those which have any pretension to soundness have risen considerably. Canadian Pacific shares were 60 a year ago, and they have recently been above 75, but are now just under 70. The company's bonds, in spite of the large addition to the amount on the market, have risen from 102¼ to 107, and they changed hands at 108 a week or two ago. The Grand Trunk series have advanced to a still larger extent. The guaranteed stock, which was 56, is now 74; the first preference has advanced from 5 to 76½, and the second preference from 38 to 58. The bonds of the various lines leased to both these great companies have correspondingly improved. The minor companies also show great progress in some cases. New Brunswick railway bonds have risen from 82 to 98, Northern of Canada third preference bonds from 82 to 96, and Windsor and Annapolis B debenture stock from 62 to 100. St. John and Maine shares have been as high as 46, but they are now not much over 30. In the other sections, there has also been some improvement. Bank of British Columbia shares have risen from 26 to 28; Bank of British North America shares, which were 60, are now 68; and Bank of Montreal shares, which, with $200 paid, closed last year at $100, are now $181. Loan shares are better than they were a year ago, Trust and Loan shares, however, being still at a slight discount. Land shares have, as a rule, improved; but there has recently been a reaction from the unduly high price of Hudson's Bay shares of a month or two ago. There is practically nothing to say of the other sections of our Canadian investments. London Canadian Gazette, COTTON MARKETS. LIVERPOOL, January 14. Cotton quiet; uplands, 6d; Orleans, 6d. NEW YORK, January 14, 1 p.m. Cotton steady; uplands, 9c; Orleans, 9 11/16c. Futures barely steady; January, 9.43c; February, 9.61c; March, 9.62c; April, 9.73c. Close, steady. COMMERCIAL. OAXTTOFPIN, Friday Evening. European Breach in the character of the cable advices, but the tendency seemed to be toward improvement. Cargoes of wheat on passage or for shipment were steadier. Red winter off coast was at 36s 6d, No. 1 California 37s 3d, California just shipped at 38s 3d and California nearly due at 37s 3d. In Liverpool, wheat was steady, with red American spring limited at 7s 4d-7s 5d. Corn was 1d lower, at 6s 8d and Canadian peas unchanged at 6s 8d. At Mark Lane, wheat and corn were quiet and flour steadier. First bakers' flour was at 26s 0d. The London Wheat and Flour Circular, of December 11, says: The weather since our last has been severe. On Sunday there was a storm of wind and snow, and the country now is generally buried in many places to some considerable depth, especially in the south and east. The temperature has been mild since, so that, although the snow remains, a great deal of it has melted and the ground is accordingly very much sodden. A heavy fall of snow is at all times welcomed from an agricultural point of view, as it acts as a fertilizer and at the same time a covering to vegetable life against frost. So much of the time since our last review of the corn trade has been taken up with the Christmas holidays that there is little to chronicle except the very marked fact that, despite the period of the year, which is always one of dullness, the firmness of the trade continues and the advance in value still goes on. During the whole of the past year, business in the corn trade has been of the most wretchedly inert description, values generally keeping much on the same par, declining gradually in the first few months, then recovering themselves until about harvest time, after which they dropped again, when in the latter part of November they commenced to mend, and have gone on improving until there is fully an advance of 6s to 10s from the lowest point, if not more. Fluent qualities of English wheat, which were selling at 34s-36s, are now fetching 40s-42s, and the improvement in Australian and Indian descriptions is fully 11s much. The first cause of this advance was no doubt the scarcity of English wheat, country millers as well as the various town mills finding it difficult to supply their requirements even on the spot, and at the same time the importations of American flour have not continued on the same scale as they were. This has caused some considerable demand on our stocks of wheat and flour, which have become much reduced from what they were. The movement thus set going has no doubt been helped by the dread of foreign political complications, and we find ourselves with the conviction that the price of wheat was unwarrantably low, while we have only India and America to look to for supplies, and are sure to have France as a competitor for them. DULUTH MARKETS. The grain markets in Chicago were worse and ruled lower. Wheat was weak and declined 1c, closing at 78c February, 79c March, 85c May. Corn eased off 1¼c, closing at 36c February, 37c March, 41c May. Oats closed at 20c February, 21c March, 30c May. Today's inspection was 23 cars winter wheat, 48 spring, 270 corn and 124 oats.

There was a large supply of fish offered, which met with a brisk demand at steady prices. THE TRAMPS TODAY. The track to Lachine will be very heavy for the St. George Snowshoe green steeplechase runners, the only point in their favor being the fact that the Montrealers will start half an hour ahead and make some kind of a road for them to travel over. The Montrealers start from the gymnasium sharp at 3 o'clock, and it is to be hoped a good gathering will be there when the president gives the word. St. George tramp off half an hour later. They also want a big muster. OTHER TRAMPS LAST NIGHT. Fifteen members of the Artillery club tramped over the mountain in the heavy snow last night and fully enjoyed their pleasant time at Donahue's after their very hard work. Next Friday will be ladies' night and is sure to be a success. On the following Friday, the annual green steeplechase will be run. Notwithstanding the stormy weather, some twenty-five members of the Prince of Wales Snowshoe club tramped out to the Athletic club house last night, where an enjoyable time was spent. The Argyle Snowshoe club held their ladies' night last evening, when about sixty couples were present. To state that a pleasant time was spent goes without saying. THE OLD TOGGER BLADES. The """"vets"""" will muster at the Gym at 3 o'clock sharp, for the tramp to Lachine. About seventy-five are expected to sit down to dinner at Harvie's. SOCIETY. MISCELLANEOUS. The new slide of the Guelph Snowshoe and Toboggan club was opened in good style on Monday night.

Owing to the carelessness of the engineer to turn the feed off the boiler last night, the wholesale dry goods warehouse of Simpson & Co., corner of Yonge and Mclihda streets, was found to be flooded this morning, the water being on each floor to a depth of several inches. The damage to the stock is estimated at $20,000, for which no compensation can be obtained. Some of the ceilings are also badly damaged, and are likely to give way. The firm has only recently taken possession of the premises. A meeting of the directors of the Ontario Creamery association was held here this afternoon. There was a fair attendance, but several were unable to be present owing to the snow blockade on the railways. By-laws were adopted and it was decided to hold the annual convention in this city, on February 16th and 17th, when several important papers will be read. With a view to more rapidly introducing the creamery system and raising the standard of butter, the following gentlemen were appointed to deliver lectures wherever farmers desire their assistance: D. Derbyshire and John Spragge, east, and M. Moyer and George Drowning, west of Toronto. A special meeting of the Board of Trade was held this afternoon to receive nominations for officers for the ensuing year. There was a very large attendance of members. William Lee, of Perkins, Line & Co., wholesale grocers, was unanimously elected president, and W. M. Russ was re-elected treasurer. Nominations were made for the council, board of arbitration, harbor commission and industrial exhibition association. The officers contested will be balloted for at the annual meeting next Friday. Notice of motion was given that Mr. Darling, the retiring president, be made a life member of the board in recognition of his invaluable service. THE CZAR'S GOVERNMENT MAKES PROPOSALS TO SETTLE THE BULGARIAN DIFFICULTY. Vienna, January 11. The most recent proposals Russia has collected for the settlement of the Bulgarian difficulty were made by Count Peter Schouvaloff at Berlin. In these, Russia maintained the candidacy of Prince Nicholas of Montenegro for the Bulgarian throne, provided that the Prince's well-known demands on the regency be generally supported. Negotiations are now proceeding on the basis of these proposals. The Continental powers are disposed to accede to Russia's proposals, and it is said that England is also desirous that a general understanding should be reached. NOTE TO OUR READERS. Followed by clearing, colder weather. Effect of the greatest snowstorm for years on the railways. Toronto, Ont., January 14, 1 a.m. The depression over Indiana yesterday is now central over Ontario. It has caused a general snowfall, turning to sleet and rain in the southern portion of the Lake region, and is now causing snow throughout the St. Lawrence. Owing to another depression now forming off the Atlantic coast, a snowstorm is prevailing in the Maritime provinces with strong winds and gales. The storm signals ordered for Maritime ports yesterday morning will be continued. St. Lawrence: Cloudy with snow followed by clearing weather; higher followed by lower temperature. A GREAT SNOWSTORM. Yesterday's snowstorm was the heaviest for many years, the amount registered at McGill observatory up to 11 p.m. being over twelve inches. This naturally had a disastrous effect on the punctuality of trains from all over the country, particularly to the west, dispatches bringing word of delays of from three to twenty hours, many trains in Western Canada, especially the locals, being cancelled. The country roads in the majority of cases are completely impassable, and it will take several days to get them into good condition again. Several freight and one or two passenger trains are reported stuck in drifts on the Grand Trunk railway and Canadian Pacific railway lines in Ontario. The Grand Trunk mail train which left Montreal at 9 p.m. on Thursday only reached Belleville at 12:30 p.m. yesterday, and the Canadian Pacific railway train, due at Ottawa at 4:48 a.m., only reached the Capitol at noon. Sir John Macdonald and Hon. Thus. While were passengers by it. The snow was so deep on the London, Huron & Bruce that the snow ploughs stuck and traffic was stopped. The Great Western division was open from Niagara to Detroit, but the Chicago Grand Trunk was badly blocked. A dispatch from Toronto at midnight said: The Grand Trunk line to the East has been cleared and the train for Montreal was dispatched in two portions, the first at 8 o'clock, the second after arrival of the first train from Detroit at 9:30. The train from Montreal due at 10:40 tonight is running over three hours late and is losing time. The Canadian Pacific railway train from Montreal this evening was cancelled and a special run from Havelock. Midland trains running to the main line at Port Hope were one hour late. The Hamilton branch was obstructed by snowdrifts and trains were considerably delayed. The express from Sarnia this morning was seven hours late. The western section of the Canadian Pacific railway is open and trains from Owen Sound and the Southern division are running on time. Snowploughs have been run in front of all the trains. The storm has been the heaviest known here for years and still continues. 382 -S 2 90 Overcast NE 82 7 00 10 mill -2 5 00 Snowing. Winnipeg, January 14. Mr. Stewart Mulvey, first vice-president of the Winnipeg Conservative association, has decided to contest Selkirk in the forthcoming Dominion elections. Both the old and young Liberal associations are holding a meeting tonight to decide on a candidate for Winnipeg. LA PRAIRIE COUNTY. A Conservative meeting for the county of La Prairie was to take place on Monday, but owing to the snowstorm which has rendered the roads almost impassable, it has been resolved to postpone the meeting till Wednesday, the 16th inst., at 11 o'clock in the forenoon. The meeting will be presided over by Mr. Pinsonneault, M.P., and will be addressed by Mr. Traft, M.H., P. Pampanon, J. Dolathionner, U. Berthelet and A. Du'lointreux. A Good Samaritan. As Mr. Nicholson, milk dealer of Lachine, was driving into the city yesterday morning, he found a young woman scantily dressed lying in the snow in an unconscious state on the bank of the canal. She was removed to an adjoining house where it was found that parts of her body were frozen. Every attention was paid her, and she is now in a fair way of recovery. CHOWAN OMOA STATISTICS. Mr. Chan Dfkii, of the office of the Crown and Peace, has just completed the statistics of his department for the past year. The table shows that $3,001.32 were paid in fines, $6,187.70 in peace fees, $1,220 in crown fees, and $3,211.20 in building taxes. These figures form a total of $13,620.42, showing a surplus of $376.45 over the receipts of 1892. Board of Health. A meeting of the Board of Health was called for yesterday afternoon, but the only members present were the chairman (Aid. Gray) and Aid. White, and the meeting had to be postponed. The principal business was to purchase eight tons of coal for St. Roch's and to consider the petition for compensation for the removal of Linker's glue factory outside the city limit. The HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. The Montreal Horticultural Society and Fruit Growers' Association for the province of Quebec will hold its annual meeting for the discussion of fruits, at Granby, P.Q., on Tuesday evening next.

Police Court. Selling liquor without a license took $93 and cents out of Nellie Hull's pocket. Miss Nettie Bedsteail hails from Cornwall, Ont., and holds the position of captain in the Salvation Army. She came down to this city Christmas morning and deposited herself and her worldly effects in the Salvation Army barracks. Soon after her arrival the effects were missed and when the police found them they were in the possession of Peter Gorman and John McGuire, whom they arrested. They were found guilty and sentenced to six months each. Joseph Chagnon saw things so blue on Christmas that he tried to hang himself. The police interfered and His Honor, who saw that whiskey was the cause of Joseph's distress, discharged him on his promising not to do it again. Thomas Milton drank and drank on Christmas day until he was drunk. While in this glorious state of intoxication he turned his attention to his wife. When he had finished, a policeman requested him to come over and interview His Honor. The man didn't care about going, but the policeman was so persistent that at last he gave in. The result of the interview was that Mrs. Milton will be a widow for two months. Edward Bergin ruined his footing on Christmas day by stealing a goat skin from a man named Pilkicr, but which he was relieved of by a policeman shortly afterwards. His Honor relieved him of his liberty for ten days. The next occupants of the dock were Joseph Lapointe, Joseph Jobin, and Ovila Deiordi. They were accused of having snowballed Walter Falls, a patrolman of the Royal Electric Light Company, and when he objected, they considerately changed their treatment to bare knuckles. The explanation comes off on Saturday. Three other men, who also took a hand in, are requested to call at any police station and help in the explanation. Church and Croysdill, the two young men who got $105 out of another young man named Lee by telling him that he was under arrest and that that sum would settle matters, as reported in these columns at the time, were committed to the Court of Queen's Bench. Michael Doolan was fined $3, requested to pay $3 damages or go into confinement for three months for having smashed several windows and a door lock of John Barry's residence. Court of Special Reunion. John G. Strachan, the man arrested for stealing lead piping from Joe Beef's old saloon, was found guilty. Since John has been boarding at Payette's it has been discovered that he was the leading genius in a series of small robberies in which various articles, ranging from a cooking stove down to a felt hat valued at 75 cents, had been taken. His Honor sized John up, and in the end considered that the world would not miss John for two years and that during that time he could fill a long-felt want in the select society of St. Vincent de Paul penitentiary. Recorder's Court. There was a long parade in this court yesterday of people who had taken a drop too much on Christmas day. Of the forty-seven cases on the list, three-quarters of them obtained the honor of an introduction to His Honor through a little drunk they had had. His Honor kindly let them off at $3 a head, and when the heads which could pay up had done so it was found that the city was $84 better off. Theophile Theberge, for committing an indecent assault upon Joseph Dupre, in Notre Dame church, obtained a chance to figure among the innocent at Payette's for two months. Helbmann Upright Pianos are built regardless of expense to successfully reproduce the most extreme atmospheric changes. Holiday stock of these famous Pianos now on sale. C. H. Crawford says that he will wager $5,000 that Stamboul can beat Stamford's Palo Alto, who holds the same record, the proposition to remain open one year. Ex-Alderman Stroud is busy with his invitations for the big snowshoers' supper on the 23rd of next month, and the boys may rely upon having a rattling good time. Mr. George Middleton, the well-known Chicago horseman, offers to match the famous gray gelding, Jack, against any trotter in the world for from $5,000 to $15,000. Numerous operations have been performed lately by English veterinarians to cure roaring by removing the arytenoid cartilage, but the result is now officially declared to be a failure. A well-known athlete says: It is a safe prediction that there will be half a dozen American amateur runners on the cinder path next season who will be able to beat 61 seconds for a quarter. Joe Donoghue, champion amateur skater, appeared before a large throng at the Palace rink in Minneapolis on Saturday evening, and was well received. He gave an exhibition mile over a 7½-lap course, covering the distance in 2:05, and it was done with apparent ease. The McGill Football Club has elected these officers: President, Mr. SOWB1IOEIXG. The Crescents Tramp. In spite of the gale that tore along the roads and howled through the naked branches of the trees, the Crescents mustered in full force for their tramp to the Athletic Club house. Once arrived at that snowshoers' haven of rest, the usual enjoyable time was spent. Songs were sung by Messrs. F. Anley, and after some other routine business had been transacted, the club started on the homeward tramp, thoroughly pleased with the evening's outing. The Club House. Mr. James Paton has evidently not let the grass grow under his feet in his efforts to improve and beautify the Athletic Club house. The lower club room is rapidly approaching completion, and by the first week of the new year it will re-echo to the merry songs of the snowshoers. The work of kalsomining the walls is also being pushed forward, and several of the rooms are already finished. The ladies' dining room is a little-gem, thanks to the efforts of Mrs. James Paton, Mrs. Fred Larmonth, and Mrs. Hugh Cameron, whose deft fingers and feminine taste have done so much towards the ornamentation, and the other rooms show marked improvement. Nor have our citizens been backward in donations towards the welfare of the snowshoers' rendezvous. Messrs. P. are mentioned as the probable reform candidate for Lisgar at the next Dominion election. Resolutions protesting against the abolition of the French language in schools have been passed by the trustees of the Norquay school district. Wheat is quoted at from 60 to 76 cents. WEALTH OF UNITED STATES. Increase of Amended Valuation from $15,000,000 to $23,000,000 in Ten Years. The New York World has obtained from the treasurer of each state the value of property as assessed for taxation. The census taken in 1880 made a report of its exhaustive and laborious inquiry into the proportions existing in each state between income and property, which ranges between 8 percent in Illinois and 18 in Wyoming. The report shows an increase in taxable property of $1,000,000 and an increase in actual wealth of $1,000,000. SHIPMAN ENGINES, COAL OIL, Marine and Stationary.

The Brazil-lit Brazil-lit II has received the following cablegram, dated today, from Guy Brio, minister of finance at Rio Janeiro: The report about the meeting of a corps of artillery is false. There was only a meeting of a few soldiers, immediately repressed. The circumstances increased confidence in the government, which shows it is prepared with prompt and decisive means to put down any disturbance of public order. The aggravation of General da Fonseca's illness is not true; on the contrary, he is recovering speedily from his former complaints. The assistant doctor believes his recovery to be certain. At any rate, the fate of the revolution, now accepted by the whole country, does not depend on the contingency of any one man's life, however precious it may be. In the army itself, the revolution can rely on other chiefs of great prestige and no less devoted to the cause. All the different political parties have espoused with enthusiasm the term fixed, November 15, 1889, for the meeting of the constitutional assembly, they considering by this act the stability of the republic is assured. """"Beware of newsmongers."""" A Most Significant Fact. New York, December 20. Private cables received today from Brazil state that the markets for exchange at both Rio and Para are in bad shape, while the rubber supply on hand will only last a few weeks. Rubber has taken an upward jump. At Para, exchange is demoralized, while at Rio the rate has declined 2 percent to 2. This makes a total decline of 8 percent since Dom Pedro's expulsion. FAIRAVISATIIUR TODAY. Yesterday's Storm Gone to Sea Lower Temperatures Probable. Toronto, December 20, 11 p.m. The depression which was over Lake Superior last night had by morning developed into a most severe storm, central in the Ottawa valley, and has since moved to the Bay of Fundy. A heavy westerly gale has prevailed all day in the Lake region, and a northeast snowstorm along the St. Lawrence from Montreal eastward. Snow and rain are falling in the Maritime provinces. Temperatures at 8 p.m.: Calgary, 40; Qu'Appello, 24; Winnipeg, 18; Toronto, 60; Montreal, 24; Quebec, 22; Halifax, 18.

Mr. Frank Boss' Magnificent Donation. Getting Ready for Next Season's Timber Trade. A Case of Influenza. Quebec, December 26. It is said that Mr. Frank Boss, of this city, brother of the late Senator James Gibb Boss, has acquired the Marine hospital at Quebec, and that he has donated $1,000,000 to found an institution for the sick of all creeds and nationalities. A very large quantity of deals arrives daily by the Lake St. John railway, and are discharging on the Louise embankment ready for shipment in the spring. It is said 40,000,000 feet of lumber will be taken out along the line this winter. A fierce snowstorm from the east set in about noon and still continues. It is reported that a genuine case of influenza has broken out here. The sufferer is 8.",1,18891227,historical,snow,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Default,256,"N. Co. While the meeting was in progress a telegram was received from the Kt. Lawrence Co. ratifying the agreement. The consensus of opinion of the shareholders present was that the bargain was to the advantage of the company. None of the company's boats have been damaged by the ice in any way worth mentioning. The Union and St. Lawrence, the lately acquired Saguenay steamers which have been wintering in the River St. Maurice, were moved by the ice, but they are now safe from damage. The L'Antigueuil and Montarville were also forced away from their quarters at Boucherville, but with the aid of the South Eastern they were both towed back to a place of safety. Navigation in the port of Montreal will open today, when the Longueuil will resume her regular trips between the city and Longueuil. It is expected that all the lines between here and the Gulf will have been opened by next Monday. The Quebec will arrive in port Monday morning and will leave for the Ancient Capital the same evening. The Trois Rivieres and Chambly also begin their regular trips on Monday. THE POLICE COMMITTEE held a very short and uninteresting meeting yesterday afternoon. A meeting of the Police committee was held yesterday, at which were present Aid. Jean not (chairman), Brunei, Kennedy, Villeneuve, Dubuc and Lee. A discussion arose about the peddlers travelling from door to door and not paying their license. After some discussion the matter was referred to the Chief. Aid. Kennedy spoke of two men who were employed at the East End abattoir in the pay of the corporation, and it was resolved that so long as the Abattoir company paid the cost of their service it might be continued. The policemen petitioned that they should be excused from payment of the water tax as well as the sergeants of the police. This after some discussion was referred to the Chief. A complaint was entered against the carters on Phillips square for improper conduct and this was left to Chief Paradis to deal with. Some argument arose before the members of the committee concerning the continuance in office of those who had been employed by the St. Jean Baptiste authorities, and it was decided to continue those in office who were meritorious. The meeting then adjourned. THE ROAD COMMITTEE want a special appropriation to repair the damage caused by the floods. A meeting of the Road committee was held yesterday afternoon, when there were present Aid. Laurent (chairman), McShane, Beausoleil, Wilson, Prefontaine, Bainville and Gray. An application from the City band to play in the summer months in the Vigor gardens was granted. It was resolved to report to council for an appropriation of $700 to pay the commissioners on the expropriation of streets. Tenders were opened for general supplies, and the principal one, that for lumber, was awarded to Mr. Huneau. On the motion of Aid. Gray it was resolved to ask the council for a special appropriation to cover the damage to the streets and sidewalks caused by the recent floods. The committee then adjourned. """"EEL AIR,"""" DORVAL As anticipated, the announcement of the sale of the magnificent residence of the late Mr. Alfred Brown, at Mr. William H. Arnton's auction rooms yesterday morning, drew a very large audience of gentlemen representing the wealth of Montreal. THE SITUATION GONE, the City Resuming its Normal Appearance-Condition of the Principal Streets. The river continued to fall steadily all day yesterday and by night nearly every street, with the exception of one or two in the low-lying parts of Griffintown, was dry. All through Griffintown, Point St. Charles and the flooded portions of St. Antoine and West wards the sidewalks were floated by the water, and will have to be relaid. On some streets the sidewalks remain intact, anchored in place by the trees and lamp posts, but more frequently they were used for rafts, and miles of sidewalks will have to be replaced entirely. Last spring this work cost $4,008, and it will probably amount to twice as much this time. On Commissioners street masses of ice, broken sidewalks, barrels, bags and all sorts of material were heaped up in a most peculiar manner. At Bonsecours market the dealers were drying their stock and removing that spoiled. Gangs of men were already at work clearing away the debris in the street. Lichtenhein's rag store, the scene of the late fire, was still smouldering. The appearance of Notre Dame street, Chaboillez square, and the depot was most deplorable. The sidewalks were broken up, plate glass windows smashed, the furniture and fittings of the stores broken to pieces with the debris strewed in all directions and the storekeepers looking anxious and bemoaning their losses. The remains of the broken sidewalks are to be collected and piled on Commissioners street and from this repository in preparing the material for repairs will be drawn until new planks can be purchased to replace those lost, stolen or strayed. The sewers have also been badly damaged by the floods. At St. Lambert the road has not only been rendered totally impassable through being cut up by the shores, but large blocks of ice extend right across it and over the fields adjacent. On the road are piled in all directions telegraph poles, railway sleepers, trestles, heavy timbers belonging to the bridges and outbuildings, fence rails and all kinds of debris from saw mills and other places. The plank sidewalks of the village from one end to the other have been completely carried away. A farmer's son, in trying to save the contents of the barn, is suffering so severely from the effects of exposure in the ice cold water that he is not expected to live. Another man lost his life attempting to swim his mule and another horse over into the water, and both driver and horse were rescued with difficulty. The following butchers have kindly offered purchases of meat for the market: Mr. Jo, Richard, 4011 lbs; Mr. Bottles, 200 bologna sausages and 150 lbs; Mr. A. Desparnwe, 80 lbs, and Mr. G. Haylinger, 100 lbs. THE THIRD READING. The following bills were read a third time and passed: To incorporate the Brockville & New York Bridge company Mr. Wood (Brockville).

To amend the Consolidated Railway act of 1871 Mr. McCarthy. THE GRAIN MARKET.

THE RECENT FLOODS Serious Loss on the South Shore-Lighthouses and Plant Damaged-But of the City. A walk through the recently flooded districts of the city yesterday showed the various proprietors and tenants rapidly repairing the damage to their property. The various shops are announcing cheap sales of damaged goods. In the streets were found stranded sidewalks, and the corporation workmen were busy repairing the other ones. In some places there was a most disgusting stench from the sewage matter deposit. The Health department has sent a supply of chloride of lime and quick lime to the following stations: No. 1, Point St. Charles; No. 7, Young street; No. 8, Seigneurs street; and to the fire station, Chuchillcz square. The poor can obtain what they require on application at these depots. The chloride of lime is intended for throwing into privies and sprinkling on the floors of cellars and into the gutters in front of the houses, and the quick lime for whitewashing fences and cellar walls, etc. The Rev. Father Tiche, cure of Lachine, has forwarded 4 loaves to the Rev. cure of Laprairie, for distribution among the poor of his village who have recently been flooded. The Rev. fathers of St. Ann's church were out all yesterday afternoon giving assistance in deserving cases of distress. Rev. Mr. Patterson has been prosecuting his visits among the poor in the flooded districts, and has been instrumental in relieving many families in Wellington, Queen, Prince, Natureth and Ann streets, and also in St. David, Roy and Dupre lanes. Many sad sights, he says, were to be seen. At this stage our great need is that of fuel to dry the terribly damp houses and household belongings. It is urged that the national societies should take up this matter, as no time is to be lost. The clothing of many of the poor people has been lost and injured to a great extent, and cast-off clothes would in many cases be most acceptable. The Island wharf is almost free of water. About 100 men were busy breaking up ice on the wharves yesterday by order of the Harbor Commissioners, in preparation for the arrival of ocean steamers. There is still a very considerable quantity of ice on the wharves, but it is rapidly disappearing under the influence of the sun and wind. Work in the Grand Trunk shops at Point St. Charles, which has been almost entirely suspended during the floods, will be fully resumed next Monday. A trip along the south shore yesterday presented a sad sight. All the fences along the river bank, between Laprairie and Longueuil have totally disappeared. Many outbuildings have been very seriously injured, and, in some cases, completely demolished. The road has been washed out in several places and altogether the view is a sad one and shows a heavy pecuniary loss. The jamming of the ice and the recent flood has had a telling effect on the lighthouses along the St. Lawrence. At Point Valois the lighthouse was torn away and stranded on Dorval Island. The piers are extensively damaged also. The pier of the new lighthouse just completed at Pointe Claire has been damaged heavily. The one recently constructed at Isle Ste. Therese withstood the shock remarkably well, except the entrance door, which was smashed in. The pier is slightly damaged. The lighthouse at Isle Vache is yet submerged and consequently the damage is not known, but it is thought to be very heavy. The lighthouse at Windsor pier, Ste. Anne, has been carried away, and the pier is seriously damaged. Several other lighthouses have been damaged more or less. BROCKVILLE BOOMING At no former period were so many buildings being put up in Brockville as there are this spring. In every direction houses are going up, mostly all of a good and some of a very superior character. On Main street there is not a single vacant store of any kind. Mr. Bigg is putting up a couple of good stores on the lot opposite the Central hotel. Mr. Comstock is putting up a magnificent building on the lot opposite the new post office on Court House avenue, and some forty dwellings are about being constructed already in various parts of the town. This will be a lively season for the building trades in Brockville. Monitor, The man who never does any harm might crawl into a cave and stay there ten years without being missed.

GOOD FRIDAY, Services at the Various Churches-The Generally Observed Day. The service in the churches of this city yesterday were all well attended and were peculiarly devotional in their nature, as was appropriate to the day. All the Roman Catholic churches were suitably draped in purple, and the voice of devotion was subdued and somewhat sad, soon to rise in a tone of joy and praise on Easter Sunday. The day was everywhere observed as a holy day throughout the city, and not so much as a holiday. In the Protestant churches appropriate services were pretty generally observed and the attendance was large. Below will be found a few particulars concerning the different services held. Tenebræ services were performed in all the Roman Catholic churches during the afternoon. This service consists of the placing of thirteen lighted tapers in the sanctuary which are extinguished one by one, after the singing of """"The Passion."""" The exception is that the thirteenth representing Our Saviour is kept burning, the other tapers being intended to represent the twelve apostles. In all the Roman Catholic churches the special shrines in honor and memory of the Eucharist were visited by large numbers of worshippers. At St. Patrick's church the celebrant of the office was the Rev. Father J. Touplu, assisted by the Rev. Fathers Walsh and Hamel, as deacon and sub-deacon. The Passion was sung by the Rev. Father Hamel.",1,18860424,historical,ice,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Default,258,"THE CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS The Chairman said: From the Harbor Master's report it will be seen that the tonnage for the month of May is the largest which we have ever had. The ocean vessels seem to be getting larger every year, the number for 1883 having been 74, average tonnage 1,171, with the same number this year they average 1,310 or 180 tons more than four years ago, so that for the same number of vessels, the tonnage has increased nearly 15,000 tons. It is worthy of notice that, notwithstanding the height of the floods reached this year, the water by 31st May had fallen to 20, that being the lowest for the previous three years, the difference being respectively 14, 8 and 12 inches less than the three previous years. The statement of revenue shows an increase of fully 14 percent for the month, as will be seen by the revenue statement. From the Engineer's report I note the following remarks: The ice left the Richelieu at Sorel, on the 12th April, without damage to the vessels wintered there. The main body of ice on the St. Lawrence between Montreal and Sorel moved off on the 18th April, and on the 24th the harbor dredging fleet came up from their winter quarters to Montreal. On the 20th the setting of the buoys was commenced with two boats, one working upwards and the other downwards from Sorel, and on the 30th April those which are essential to the opening of navigation were all placed. On the 27th the first dredges of the ship channel fleet left Sorel, and by the 6th May all were at work on their stations. MONTREAL HARBOR On the clearing away of the ice from the harbor it was found that, although no very great destruction had occurred at any one place, there had been a number of minor damages, which in the aggregate are rather larger than the average. No such quantity of ice was left lodged on the wharves as in the spring of 1885, but from section 21 (opposite Canadian Pacific Railway station) downwards, there was much more than usual, and it was necessary, in order to make vessels' berths, that a great deal should be removed by hand. The expenditure for this amounts to about $1,900. Dredging commenced on the 3rd May. Section 16 The pier used at the St Helen's island ferry wharf had the plank top stripped off and was otherwise considerably damaged during winter. The downstream side, which was the worst, is being built, and a new top is being put on throughout. The roadways and wharves received minor damages during winter in many places. These have been, in a great measure, repaired during the month, and, with the exception of the crib work in sections 9 and 10, Windmill Point, the whole is now in a fair condition for use. It may be noted, as a matter of record, that two grain carriers have been built at high level across the wharf at sections 21 and 22 for carrying grain from the new Canadian Pacific Railway elevator to the mill in the lumber, and they seem to be working well. An important judgment was rendered in our favor on the 28th May, regarding the responsibility of the commissioner in the event of damage to vessels by the work of the steamboat Ottawa. The Chief Justice stated that he was unable to find any law for holding the commissioner responsible for the accident, that they were not private corporations, but a public corporation created to perform certain work under the supervision of the Government, and with authority in placing buoys in such places as they might consider necessary. The following letter has been received from the Department of Public Works: Ottawa, June 7, 1888, Sir, I am directed to state for the information of the Harbour Commissioner of Montreal that, in compliance with the request made, an order thereon has been issued appointing Henry K. Perley, representing the Board of Trade and Corn Exchange Association of Montreal, John K. Sherwood, representing the Board of Marine Commissioners of Montreal, and Percival W. K., Secretary of the Commission, It is satisfactory to know that the Commission has at last been appointed, and that they will be sent today to meet. It is hoped that they may be able to arrive at an early decision, so that all possible work may be done this season. AS EXPLANATION During the last few weeks I have noticed several letters in the papers commenting on an interview with me made by a gentleman of the press. These I did not think it necessary to notice, as they seemed to be too absurd to be believed, but in justice to the gentleman let me say that I am credited with saying that Mr. Thomas Workman had in the thirties written his name under the eaves of the building where Joe's canteen now stands, from a river boat. If instead of from a river boat you will read from the ice it will be correct, Mr. Workman being my authority, and I believe the year was 1839. My object in mentioning this was to show that when there was no revetment wall the shelving bank allowed the ice to be pushed up to a much higher height than has been the case since the revetment wall was built. As for Mr. Hogan having built from the foot of Nelson a monument, I never spoke to Mr. O'Hara on the subject, know nothing about it, and do not believe it. REPORT OF MARITIME Number and tonnage of sea-going vessels that arrived in port from the opening of navigation up to June 1st the following years: Years 1883 1884 1885 1886 1887 Parent, Mayor Hurtubise, of Longueuil, L. L. Morin, Mr. Lalonde, and Mr. Vauasse, M.P. for Yamaska. Windmill Point was visited, and the proposed extension of wharves upwards was explained and the ground pointed out. The tug steamed down the river to near Longue Pointe, and returned to Montreal. On the way down the Harbor engineer showed plans of the proposed lumber wharves at Hochelaga, and also plans of notable ice thaws, etc., for several years past. HOUSEHOLD SUPPLIES Where a Good Selection Can be Secured This is the season when a visit to Bonsecours market can be made with most satisfactory results, for the quality, quantity and variety of household supplies offered cannot be equaled elsewhere. This week the offerings have been liberal, even profuse, which ensures to the buyer ample scope to make selections, and at prices too which are low enough to suit nearly every purse. A special feature of this week is the display of early fruits, including excellent apricots from California, and peaches and cherries from the same quarter. Strawberries have become more plentiful and consequently more reasonable in price. The dairy produce department is worthy of patronage as several of the dealers make it a point to keep the very best stock on hand. There was a good line of fresh killed poultry, and frozen turkeys, geese, chickens, etc., are always kept by the principal dealers who have large refrigerators for that purpose. Beef, mutton, lamb and smoked meats of fine quality are to be had at moderate prices, with no change made for delivery, which is always made promptly. Fish from salmon to herring can be purchased on satisfactory terms. Altogether Bonsecours market is well worthy of the extensive patronage it receives.",1,18860610,historical,ice,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Patrick Hanley, 150 Young Street, was struck by a piece of ice falling from a roof on Notre Dame Street on Saturday morning and received a severe cut on the head. Mr. Thomas Robertson, M.L. Light, Chief Engineer of Railways of the Province of Quebec, in a letter to the Chronicle, favors the construction of a bridge to span the St. Lawrence near Quebec. He says recent surveys with modern inventions having proved that the River St. Lawrence could be bridged near Quebec at a reasonable cost, without detriment to navigation, I would suggest that the time has arrived for the construction of such a bridge, and that the Federal Government, on behalf of the Intercolonial, should unite with the Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific Railways to effect this object by means of which the traffic of the Grand Trunk and Intercolonial Railways should be enabled to enter the city of Quebec, and a winter outlet be afforded to the Canadian Pacific over the Intercolonial Railway. Regarding the cost of the bridge, I have no doubt that for such an object the money could be borrowed at 4 percent, with a Government guarantee, as in a presently similar case at St. John, N.B. Several offices in the Departmental Buildings are being converted into committee rooms in anticipation of the meeting of the Legislature. Mr. Francis Eden has been appointed Vice-Consul for Sweden and Norway. There is a report current that Almi will give two concerts in Quebec next summer. Two French frigates from the Newfoundland station will visit the St. Lawrence next year. The first mails from the country parishes since the great storm which set in on the 1st instant reached town today, the bags having to be carried in on snowshoes. Such a complete stoppage of communication in the country has not been known here for twenty years. The markets today were consequently but very slightly attended. The cold here is not so intense as reported West, and the thermometer has not yet, up to tonight, reached zero. Madame Verier, boarding house keeper, Garneau Street, dropped dead last night at her residence from apoplexy. Quebec, January 6. The weather was excessively cold today and for a time, there was an ice jam right across the river, the boats having great difficulty in keeping the bridge from forming. THE WEATHER Toronto, January 7. The area of highest pressure extends from Manitoba southeast to the middle Atlantic coast, and there is a disturbance covering Texas and the adjacent states. Throughout the continent the weather has been unusually cold, the temperature falling to 20 degrees as far south as the State of Mississippi. The lowest temperatures reported in Canada have been 20 below zero at Parry Sound, 33 below at Corkliffe and 21 below at Quebec. The excessive cold which has prevailed for some days in the Northwest Territories is beginning to moderate. Forecast: Winds gradually shifting towards the eastward; generally fair weather today; snow areas tomorrow; not much change in temperature. St. Lawrence: Moderate to fresh winds; fair, continued very cold weather. Maritime: Moderate to fresh west to northwest winds; fair, continued very cold weather. At Chicago the thermometer at 7 AM on Saturday was 27 below zero. Batavia is still partially paralyzed. There were a number of fires last night, and the endurance of the firemen was taxed to the utmost. The Interviage flats caught fire, and a number of people were compelled to seek the street in their night clothes. The severe weather caused a great many needy people and tramps to besiege the relief agencies. At St. Louis the thermometer registered 22 below zero; the lowest since 1640. At Kansas City it was 29 below, and many miles were frozen to death on the Pacific train. At Louisville, Kentucky, it was 18 below, and several deaths are reported from freezing, and much suffering occurred among the cattle. At Fort Wayne, Indiana, it was 24 below, at Elkhart 23 below, and at New Albany 21 below, the coldest known in thirty-five years. In the South the heaviest snowstorm in years prevailed over almost the whole of Virginia, extending to South Carolina. NORTHWEST WHEAT QUESTION: A letter from General Van Horn on the subject to the Winnipeg Free Press. We find the following important letter from General Manager Van Home in the Winnipeg Free Press of the 31st December, 1883: To the Editor of the Free Press; So I have watched with deep interest the discussion of the wheat and elevator situation in the newspapers of Manitoba, and as it had taken such shape as to injure the country abroad, and as much that has been said reflects upon the policy of this company, I beg permission to say something on the subject, but first I wish to remark that the discussion, as it has been carried on, would impress one not conversant with the facts with the belief that the entire wheat crop of Manitoba, instead of a small percentage of it, had been ruined by frost. The general question of rates is too wide to admit of clear discussion within the limits of a communication of this kind, but a comparison of the prices paid for wheat at our stations with those paid in Minnesota and Dakota will prove conclusively that our farmers are as well off, and generally better off, in this respect, than their neighbors to the South. It is not the rate between two local stations that should be considered, but the through rate that the company is able to offer and on which the local grain markets are based. Just now the chief cause of complaint seems to be the prices offered for damaged wheat, of which there is a large quantity in some localities. The Canadian Pacific Company will gladly do anything within its power to enable the farmers to dispose of this wheat at good prices; but as it does not answer the purposes of the Manitoba millers, one of two things must be done with it. It must either be held for spring shipment via Port Arthur, or it must be shipped through by rail to eastern points. The all-rail rates will leave scarcely anything for the farmers. We have used our best endeavors with the eastern lines to secure a reduction in rates, but without avail. We have reduced our own rates on the damaged wheat one-third, but were we to have it free over our own line it would not afford appreciable relief. The damaged wheat is very uneven in quality, and among the millers everywhere there is a wide difference of opinion as to its value. The shippers cannot know what prices it will bring on reaching the eastern market, and for safety they are obliged to allow large margins. It appears, therefore, that the all-rail shipment of this wheat must result in sacrifice either to the farmer or the shipper. On the other hand, there is good reason to believe that the damaged wheat, if stored in large quantities until the opening of navigation, would heat, and buyers are not disposed to take this risk. They would require very large margins to justify them in doing so, and they cannot reasonably be blamed for exacting them. Nor are the Manitoba millers to blame for not buying this wheat. They have a special market for their shipping flour, and have endeavored to secure for it the highest standing in the eastern and foreign markets, already with considerable success, but they must have the very best wheat from which to make it, and it is certainly to the interest of every farmer in the Northwest that the reputation of Manitoba flour, as well as of Manitoba wheat, should be put above all the rest of the world and kept there, as it can and should be. I know that it will pinch many farmers who have much damaged wheat to hold it until the opening of navigation, but I believe that if they can and will do it, and will in the meantime guard against its further injury by keeping it dry and giving it light and air, they will have little cause to complain. As to the so-called elevator monopoly, I beg to say that none exists on our lines. Every person who likes may build an elevator on our grounds without charge for ground rent, and on as liberal terms as are given to anyone, and no individual or corporation will have any advantage over him in rates. Our requirements in the way of elevators are not severe. The stations are graded for buildings of 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 bushels minimum bin capacity, according to the prospective business. If any company or individual should build an elevator at a cost of $10,000 at any station it will not prevent the building by any other party of one costing less than half that amount, if it comes up to the required capacity for that station and is provided with the usual appliances for handling and cleaning grain. In this matter we have followed the practice of almost every railway company in the grain-producing States, a practice which long experience has shown to produce the best results for all concerned and to be absolutely necessary where grain is largely produced. Some railways provide elevators of their own, and require all grain to be handled through them, but this plan has never worked satisfactorily, as it has a tendency to breed a crop of irresponsible buyers. A grain buyer in an ordinary warehouse, buying two or three kinds of grain and several grades of each kind, has little chance to grade it properly, and when it is coming in freely he cannot grade it at all. Wheat is then wheat, and must all go in the same pile, good and bad, """"goose wheat"""" and """"hard rye."""" Such a mixture does not bring the average value of the different lots, but only a little more than the value of the lowest grade, and the buyer can only pay for the best about the value of the worst. The buyer is unable to clean his grain, and he must ship it, dirt and all, and must leave a margin for that. Again, a flat warehouse costs but a few hundred dollars; and where they are permitted they multiply until the station ground is covered, and until there are more buyers than the market will supply at a reasonable profit. If they compete, they are driven to cheating in weights or grades. If they do not compete, they divide their purchases and take a sufficient margin to afford a living for all. The usual margin among a lot of warehouses is from 10 cents a bushel upwards, unless they are able to make the nominal margin less by taking the difference out of grades or weights. At the elevator the margin is usually between three and four cents. This is according to my experience on grain roads, which has covered a period of more than twenty years. It is true that the elevator men sometimes take wider margins, and sometimes cheat, but they are more easily watched and controlled, and they have too much at stake to justify the risk. A threat on the part of the railway company to withdraw their protection has never failed, so far as I know, to have the desired effect, and to straighten out anything crooked. The elevators are provided with separate bins for the different kinds and grades of grain and with cleaning apparatus, and are able to handle grain more cheaply, and to get more value out of it, than can be done by means of any warehouse, and I feel sure that every farmer who has had experience with both systems will agree with me that, notwithstanding the original abuse of their system by the elevator men, the elevator benefits the producer as well as the consumer. The only way to secure the elevators is by providing the necessary facilities. An elevator exists, if he will build it, and an elevator in connection with the railway is the best way to sell his grain to advantage. Our elevator contract requires us to receive, store and load grain at reasonable rates, and the principal rates for handling are two cents per bushel, as low as anywhere in the western States. In conclusion permit me to say that this company has as great an interest as the farmers themselves in the payment of the highest possible prices for grain and other produce and that it is making every effort at Port Arthur and elsewhere to provide the cheapest possible outlet for the products of the Northwest, and no expense will be spared to that end; but the value of Manitoba wheat will depend largely upon its general reputation abroad, and this is within the control of the farmers. They must plough early and not wait until the verge of winter. They must sow good seed and of the kind most wanted, and they must sow it early; and when they have secured a crop, they must stack it carefully and keep ice and snow out of it. Fine particles of ice and snow in wheat marketed in winter cannot be detected, and one lot containing them may ruin ten times the quantity in an elevator bin. This increases the risk of the buyers and is certain to widen their margins, the careful farmer suffering with the careless. Neglect in those particulars has contributed largely to the present causes of complaint. Respectfully yours, W.",1,18840107,historical,ice,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Default,260,"HUDSON'S BAY NAVIGATION, Report of the Commander of the Expedition of Last Year, THE ICE BARRIERS ENCOUNTERED, GTTiwi, February 10, The report of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, presented this afternoon, contains a most interesting and important report by Lieut. Gordon, who commanded the expedition to Hudson's Bay last summer. The Neptune, the vessel chartered for the expedition, left Halifax on July 7, 1911, and arrived at Churchill Island, Hudson's Bay, on September 9th, and at York Factory on the 11th of the same month, having established along the way a number of observatory stations. The main interest in the report centers in the condition and character of the navigation of Hudson's Straits and Bay, on which point Lieut. Gordon says: The ice has been supposed, hitherto, to be the most formidable barrier to the navigation of the straits, but its nature disappears, to a great extent, under investigation. The ice met with on the cruise of the Neptune may be divided into three classes having distinctly separate origins. They are: icebergs from the glaciers of Fox Channel; heavy Arctic field ice from the channel itself, and what may be called ordinary field ice, being that which had been formed on the shores of the bay and straits. We met no icebergs in Hudson's Bay, nor did I hear of any being seen there. In the straits a good many were seen, principally along the north shore, where many of them were stranded in the coves, and some were met with in mid-channel. Of those seen in the eastern end of the straits, some had undoubtedly come in from Davis' Straits, passing between Resolution Island and East Bluff; but all of those met to the westward had come from Fox Channel, as observations made by Mr. Ashe, at North Bluff, show that an iceberg coming in sight from the westward will pass out of view to the eastward in from three to four tides, showing an easterly set of upwards of ten miles a day. The ICEBERGS SEEN IN HUDSON'S STRAITS in August and September would form no greater barriers to navigation than do those met with off the Straits of Belle Isle, nor were they more numerous in Hudson's Straits than they frequently are off Belle Isle. The ordinary field ice was met with off North Bluff and the Upper Savages, on the 11th of August. This ice, though it would have compelled an ordinary iron steamer to go dead slow, gave no trouble to the Neptune, the mate on watch running the steamer at full speed through between the pans, rarely touching one of them. Just before entering Ashe's Inlet we had to break through a heavy string, which was, however, done without in the slightest degree injuring the ship. In the harbor (Ashe Inlet) the ice came in with the flood tide, and set so fast that the Eskimo were able to walk off to the ship, a distance of three-quarters of a mile. On the south shore our experience was much the same, but no ice was met with through which the ship could not have forced her way without damage. In the center of the straits, to the east of North Bluff, no field ice was seen at all, and after leaving Stuart's Bay, on the outward voyage, although the vessel lay-to for the night in the ice, it was only to wait for daylight, and not because the ice was too heavy. This pack extended about eighteen miles out into the straits, and after getting over this distance we came into clear water. From this point to Charles Island, and thence to the end of Salisbury Island, icebergs were frequently seen, but as their direction was invariably parallel to our course, or nearly so, we coasted round them. On the homeward voyage none of this field ice was seen. The Eskimo, both at Ashe Inlet and Stuart's Bay, informed me that there was an unusually great quantity of ice in the straits this year, and that they had never seen the ice hang to the shores so late in the season. THE HEAVY ARCTIC ICE, After passing the east end of Salisbury Island the ice got heavier and closer, and when off Nottingham Island the pack was so run together that I determined to give up the attempt to force the ship through it, and working out again, headed more to the southward. In making in for the land here we broke the propeller, but succeeded in taking the ship into harbor with the stumps. Viewed from the top of a hill on Nottingham Island the sea in every direction was one vast ice field, and to the southward, between Southeast Point and Cape Oigges, we saw four vessels fast. The ice was altogether of a different type to what we had hitherto met with. Some of it was over 40 feet thick of solid blue ice, not field ice, which had been thickened by piling of pan on pan, but a solid sheet of ice which had evidently been frozen just as we saw it. Much of it was 20 feet thick, and for the general average of all the field we passed through coming into harbor I estimate that the thickness would have been upwards of 15 feet. The question as to the origin of this ice and whether it will be frequently met with in the west end of the Straits is an important one; for in such ice, when closely packed, a vessel even of the build and power of the Neptune was perfectly helpless. I do not consider that it is possible for ice to form in Fox Channel to a greater thickness than 10 feet in a single year, and I feel convinced that much of the ice which we encountered was the accumulation of several years. The depth to which water will freeze has, so far as I know, never yet been determined, but it is certain that ice being a very poor conductor of heat, once a certain thickness of ice has been formed, the rate of thickening will be very slow. In regard to this point, measurements of the formation of ice will be made at some of the observing stations in Hudson's Straits this year, which will assist in finally determining this question. If, as seems probable from the reports of the Hudson's Bay ships, this year and last year have been exceptionally heavy ice years, it is reasonable to conclude that only occasionally does this heavy Fox Channel ice appear in Hudson's Straits. Another piece of confirmatory evidence as to the EXCEPTIONAL NATURE of THE ICE met with in the northern part of the bay this year is the statement in Captain Fisher's letter, found at Marble Island and quoted in the narrative portion of my report, that he had been unable to reach, up to the date of his letter, the east shore, or to go up the Welcome on account of the ice. The harbor ice forms at Churchill on the average about the middle of November and breaks up about the middle of June. As this is the only known harbor on the west coast of the bay, these times may be taken as marking the extreme limits of the season during which it would be possible for a ship to enter and leave the harbor. It is only fair to state that had I been making the passage from Cape Chudleigh, direct to Churchill instead of coasting and working across the Straits, I do not consider that I should have been delayed by ice more than forty-eight hours; but no ordinary iron steamship, built as the modern freight carrier is, could have got through the heavier ice that was met without incurring serious risk, if not without actual disaster. Since the foregoing was written, I have received a copy of the report of Lieut. Kay, United States Signal Service, to the Chief Signal Officer, on the conduct of the observations at Point Barrow in the Arctic. He gives as the greatest thickness of ice formed in one season 6 feet 3 inches. At Point Barrow the formation of ice on the shore is certainly influenced by the passage of a current of warm water passing through Bering Straits and setting northeast. Fox Channel has no such advantage, and I still think it possible that a sheet of ice 10 feet in thickness might be formed there in one season. L. Mathews, P.O. Box 10.

THE TRAPPERS AT QUEBEC, Quebec, February 10, La Trappeur Snow Shoe Club of Montreal have had a splendid time since their arrival here yesterday morning. This afternoon the city clubs marched to the St. Louis Hotel and escorted the visitors on a tramp across the ice bridge to the Tofield Hotel, where they were treated to a sumptuous luncheon, after which they turned to the city en route for the concert at the Music Hall. At the conclusion of the day's sports the clubs of the city accompanied the visitors to the North Shore Station with lighted torches and headed by two bands. A display of fireworks took place along the route and considerable enthusiasm was manifested. A great concourse of people had assembled at the depot to see them off, and as the train left the station three hearty cheers were given. C. McDonald; $75, from Messrs.

Jenkins, from New York bound to Newcastle, England, put in here damaged by ice. Captain Jenkins makes the following report: We left New York at noon on the 1st instant with a cargo of merchandise. On the 7th ice was met and that evening after dark we sailed right into an open bay of ice; it became impossible to force our way any farther and about midnight the plates close to the water line were cracked and damaged. The steamer's position at the time was about 48° 20' North and 58° West. The ice had closed in around her and as far as the eye could reach nothing was visible but a vast field of ice and there were immense bergs towering hundreds of feet above the surface, with their glittering pinnacles. North of latitude 45 seemed a solid field. Captain Jenkins states that he never saw so much ice in his life, particularly in the position and so early in the season. For four days the steamer was wedged in solid, and when at last it was managed to get her out she was headed at once for Halifax. She will be temporarily repaired here and proceed for her destination as soon as possible. The port warden will make a thorough inspection of the Ripon City tomorrow. He took a look at her today; although the vessel is leaking somewhat in the forward compartment, temporary repairs, he considers, will be quite sufficient to carry her safely across. The mail steamer Campion, which arrived at 8 a.m. today from Liverpool, had a mild passage across. On Friday last, in lat. 1:12, long. E. de Cossar, who is personally acquainted with King John and thinks not meanly of his talents and character, and of the prospects of his people under favorable circumstances, was of the opinion early last summer that if his good offices were sought, he would prove a valuable ally. Whether it is still possible or desirable to utilize his friendship in that way we do not know, but perhaps it has remained for Italy to avail herself of opportunities which England allowed to pass unused. It is also possible that the Abyssinians, seeing the Mahdi in possession, may be moved to try the chances of a march from Gellabat which, Sir S. Baker says, would be a direct descent upon Khartoum by the river Ilahad and the Blue Nile, through a fertile country teeming with supplies. Awkward as would, at other times, be such a move, whatever would engage the attention of the victorious Mahdi would be welcome at the present crisis. Though acting for herself, Abyssinia would in such a case be England's timely ally. HUDSON'S BAY NAVIGATION, The information acquired by Lieut. Gordon, who commanded the expedition to Hudson's Bay last summer, is necessarily of a partial and incomplete character, the journey being somewhat hurriedly made, and having for its object the establishment of observatory stations rather than the ascertainment of definite and large knowledge of the duration of navigation in the bay and straits. Such conclusions as can be drawn, however, from the observations made and the data obtained, point to the possibility of safely navigating these waters during three or four months of the year. The character of the ice met with is divided into three classes, having each a separate origin, namely: icebergs from the glaciers of Fox Channel, heavy Arctic field ice from the channel itself, and ordinary field ice formed on the shores of the bay and straits. Icebergs were not seen in Hudson's Bay, and in the straits those encountered are reported to have been not more numerous or more formidable than are met with off the Straits of Belle Isle. The ordinary field ice forms no barrier to the easy passage of steamers, but the heavy field ice attaining a depth of forty feet, and averaging last season quite fifteen feet in thickness, renders the progress of steamers and vessels impossible. This apparently serious drawback to navigation is qualified by Lieut. Gordon with the explanation that the season was an unusually severe one, and an unfair test of the character of the ice ordinarily encountered in the straits and bay during August and September. He expresses the opinion that the more formidable ice of this description was the result of an accumulation of several years. It is probable from the report that the expedition will have to be made and observations taken during three or four years in succession to solve with reasonable certainty the duration of the safe navigation of Hudson's Bay, and in view of the importance of the question to the Northwest, a definite settlement of the problem is well worth the expenditure involved. The great value of the fisheries of Hudson's Bay is made apparent by the report of Lieut. Gordon, from which it appears that New England whaling vessels have been engaged in these waters for many years past, and have taken therefrom in a recent period fish to the value of more than two million dollars, and that the catch per vessel averages nearly thirty thousand dollars. The Hudson's Bay Company also is extensively engaged in the fisheries of the bay, deriving therefrom considerable profit. The company has established extensive refineries at several of their northern stations, and instead of exporting the blubber of the porpoise in bulk, now refine it and ship the pure oil in casks. Fresh salmon in refrigerators are also largely exported to England where a ready and profitable market is found. In connection with this subject, Lieut. Gordon makes the timely suggestion that in any negotiations undertaken by the Canadian government looking to reciprocity of trade with the United States, the value of the fisheries of Hudson's Bay should receive due consideration. They are already valuable in character, largely availed of by the Americans, and likely to become more and more sought after as the resources of the region become better known, and pending a treaty it is desirable that such regulations should be framed as will prevent the use of explosives in the whale fisheries of Hudson's Bay, the effect of which is inevitably to rapidly exhaust the supply. Another undue advantage the Americans now enjoy is trading with the natives of the region. The Hudson's Bay Company, in trading, have to pay duties, and a considerable amount of money accrues to the government from customs dues on importations at Churchill, York, and Moose Factory, but every American whaler entering the bay is an unlicensed trader, carrying in American goods and trading with the natives, in unfair competition with the Hudson's Bay Company, whose goods pay duties. The French papers which have of late been prophesying the uprising of India should reflect that there is far more likelihood of an insurrection in Tunis and Algiers. The wave of fanaticism is more likely to sweep westward by its old route along the Mediterranean seaboard than it is to cross the Indian Ocean or to make its way through conflicting nations and tribes to beyond the Indus. It is the Sultan, if anyone, that should be concerned about the Mahdi's success. It is forgotten that Islam is not one any more than Christendom, and that the sword of the faithful has for long centuries been drawn as often against each other as against the giaour. The Canadian Gazette says: Many of the leading commercial men of the Dominion are actively supporting the action of our chambers of commerce, in regard to Canada's bankruptcy law. As will have been seen from our Dominion News last week, a very influential deputation waited on Sir John Macdonald on the subject, on his return from England, and evidently desired to strengthen in every way possible the impression produced on the mind of the Premier by the representations of the gentlemen who approached him on the matter whilst in London. Sir John addressed the deputation at some length, and from the general tenor of his remarks it is evident that while still recognizing the difficulties of the problem, he is resolved that the whole matter shall be considered most earnestly by the Government at the earliest date. The supreme importance of the question to the trade of Canada is fully recognized. These remarks are all the more to the point now that, as our readers are aware, a committee has been appointed to collect information on the subject from all the provinces.

Default,261,"APRIL 27 A BREAK AT QUEBEC The Ice in Front of the City Passes Out THE CAP ROUGE JAM First Report Said It Had Also Broken But This Is Doubtful Quebec, April 26 (Special) The two remaining ice jams in the river gave way tonight, and now everything goes so far as obstructions to free navigation are concerned. All yesterday and all today, while the ferry crossed to and from Levis in perfectly clear water, a sheet of heavy ice from above jammed into the Quebec narrows of the river, extending right across from under the Citadel, just above the ferry crossing, to nearly a mile upstream. It was an object of much concern to shippers and of great interest to spectators and promenaders on Dufferin Terrace, thousands of whom were watching it at 7:15 tonight, when it suddenly broke and moved out with the falling tide. The ferry steamer Polaris had to run before it to seek shelter at Indian Cove, and the tug Spray was immediately dispatched downstream to meet the steamship Vancouver, which was then about due at that point, providing it had continued on its way upstream, and to warn it of the danger of the heavy ice, which it would thus have had time to avoid by turning about and seeking shelter downstream. Mingled with the ice that passed down for an hour and a half in front of the city was a large amount of debris of various kinds, and quite a quantity of logs, indicating that it had come, in part at least, from the Chaudiere, where so many bridges, houses, and logs were swept down into the St. Lawrence some days ago. It made a grating sound against the riverside wharves and dashed up lots of water, and some fear was experienced for the safety of the gas buoys on the Government wharf, but they were fortunately untouched. Everybody was engaged in discussing the probability of the ice jam at Cape Rouge still holding for some days, when at 9 o'clock telegraph and telephone messages came in from the Cape that it had given way, and from New Liverpool, Etchemin, Sillery, and Bridgewater Cove, to the effect that the lake ice and that from the Sillery jam were passing down together. This ends the blockade in the river, and though there will be floating masses of ice of considerable size carried up and down the stream in and about the harbor here for the next two or three tides, summer pontoons will be in their places in a day or two, and summer ferries to Levis, and the Island and the Montreal and Saguenay steamers will find no obstacles to contend with after a couple of days more. Ocean steamers will be able to ascend the river on Tuesday without any fear of damage here from ice. The fruit ships now in Indian Cove may not leave their haven there tomorrow, and it will altogether depend upon the manner in which the tides dispose of the ice whether the Vancouver will be able to round the point and make the Louise dock tomorrow. Had she arrived up during this afternoon before the jam broke, everything was ready for her entrance into the basin. The steamship Loughriggholme, previously reported here, with coal for Webster & Co., came up today from Indian Cove, and went into Louise Basin, where she will discharge tomorrow. The placing of the buoys in the river will commence on Tuesday. The first of the Cap Rouge and lake ice passed here shortly before midnight. The steamship Vancouver is anchored at Baie des Aulnaies. The steamer Spray, that left here just as the ice did, with Mr. Ramsay, of the Dominion Steamship Line, aboard, to intercept the Vancouver, had a narrow escape in getting out of the basin. She just cleared it as the descending ice struck the wharf. The Spray is now in shelter at St. Laurent. It is reported that portions of a lighthouse from some point between here and Montreal have been found, with other wreckage, in the ice, and Mr. S's immigration staff arrived here today for the season. Cap Rouge May be Solid Yet Quebec, April 27 Ice that passed here about midnight is not Cap Rouge ice at all, but Chaudiere Basin ice, Cap Rouge ice not having yet reached here. Experienced river men believe it has not moved at all, but that New Liverpool, Etchemin, Sillery, and Bridgewater Cove, who report it on the way, have all mistaken Chaudiere Basin ice for it and reported accordingly. There is not a telephone at Cap Rouge, and the telegraph company cannot raise their operator there. Being on 3 o'clock now, the non-arrival of ice from Cap Rouge casts doubts on original reports of the break of the jam. It is too late for correspondents to reach Cap Rouge over present roads in time to ascertain facts and get back here early enough to transmit intelligence. The Loughriggholme's Trip Up Quebec, April 25 Capt. Millican, of the steamship Loughriggholme, has forwarded to the Chronicle, of this city, the following report, which will prove of considerable interest to Montreal shippers: """"We left Louisburg at 6 a.m. on the 19th instant, with coals for Quebec. When off Cape Sottari found the ice close packed and heavy from the land to the north and east, as far as we could see from the masthead. Stood E.E. along the southern edge of ice for thirty miles, and so got round it and made for Cape North. At dark, finding the ice ahead, hove to for daylight. Started at daylight, 20th, and had to keep more northerly for St. Paul's. After passing through six miles of loose ice, stopped at Atlantic Cove and had a visit from the signalman and his friends, who were anxious to have a late paper, as the last one they saw was of the 1st April. He reported heavy ice at the Magdalen Islands, but had no news of the ice off Anticosti. The ice seemed close packed from St. Paul's to Cape North. After passing north of St. Paul's found clear water for quite a distance west of that Island, in which were two American schooners halibut fishing. Made Bird Rocks, but could not get near them, as the ice was pretty close for eight miles north of them, saw one three-masted schooner and several small schooners amongst this ice. Skirted round this ice and, dark coming on, hove to. At midnight a fresh gale sprang up from the northwest. Started at daylight against the still strong breeze and many short head seas. Saw Bird Rocks 14 miles off W.W. of us, but no ice was to be seen. The breeze dropped down to nothing, and we made Anticosti at daylight on the 22nd. Thence had fine weather; no ice. At 8 a.m. on the 23rd, got pilot at Bio and proceeded to River du Loup, where we anchored at 1 p.m., to keep the company of the Fremona and Flumoro, steamers bound for Montreal. After communicating with Mr. Harold Kennedy, and consulting pilot, we decided to start for Indian Cove, which we did at 7 a.m. this day. It seemed to us very pretty work to watch the way Pilot Joseph Larochelle picked his way along the banks by the lead, more especially was this observable coming through the Traverse, where the shore marks are so distant as to be hardly made out. Everything went well, and we made our way out safely, met no ice till we reached St. Laurent, but thence to town met quite a few large pieces, one of which gave us but bare room to pass it and keep clear of the ground. Spoke steamer Contest, who said he had got out of the Lachine, which gave us hopes of reaching that much-desired haven. We accordingly made for the entrance at 8 p.m., and hailed the shore for an opinion of our being able to enter, and the answer came, yes. We, however, did not get our rope ashore, when we were hailed again with the news the ice was coming down, and we had no time to get in, so there was no help, but we must run for Indian Cove, which we reached before the ice, and so made fast to await the breaking away of the ice. Steamships Reach Port The steamships Tiber and Acadian arrived in port on Saturday, from Sorel, to commence their season's work. The Tiber is in command of Capt. John Delisle, but the Acadian, which has recently been purchased from the Allan line, is in command of Capt. Joseph Delisle, the son of Capt. John Delisle. During the winter months the Acadian has been thoroughly overhauled, and she has now some first-class passenger accommodation. The Acadian will leave about Wednesday with a full general cargo for the Lower Provinces. Notice to Pilots Mr. Robertson, the Secretary of the Harbor Commissioners, received the following letter on Saturday from Mr. Gregory, the Agent at Quebec for the Department of Marine and Fisheries: """"I am notified that several lights above, notably Pointe aux Cèdres, near Batiscan, front light Contrecoeur, front light Les Raisins, front light L'Islet, Richelieu, front light Grondines, and probably others, have been more or less injured and cannot be relied upon as being in operation at present. Every effort is being made to remedy defects. Please notify pilots to be cautious."""" Notice In re Buoying of Channel The principal buoys are now planned between Montreal, via the Lavaltrie (or North) channel, and Three Rivers. Two boats will leave Sorel early tomorrow morning to begin placing the most important buoys below Three Rivers. First Arrival at Kingston Kingston, April 20 The schooner Annie Minns was the first sailing craft to arrive here from across the lake. She sailed Friday from Oswego, having left there on Thursday with a cargo of fresh mined Scranton coal. Capt. Savage is again on deck. He says that on the trip across much ice was encountered. The schooner was obliged to round up at Pigeon Island and sail back to the upper gap, entering the harbor by that route. An Obstruction In Lake Huron Colchester, Ont., April 25 The steam barge Teutonia, with two consorts, ran foul of a wreck two miles west of here, and almost directly in the channel, last night, and is still fast. The obstruction is supposed to be the remains of the schooner Gibbs, sunk about three years ago off Bar Point. It was brought down by the ice last winter. The vessel is being lightened. For Coal Service Portsmouth, N.H., April 25 The Dominion Coal Company has chartered four large schooners, the Sarah E. Palmer, Mary E. Palmer, Augustus Palmer, and Win. L. Palmer, to carry coal from Nova Scotia to Boston. Disasters London, April 25 The steamer Bushmills, from New Orleans for Dromon, has arrived at Plymouth, where she landed the crew of the American schooner Eunice L. Crocker, Captain Croaker, from Fernandina, March 10, for Boston, which was abandoned at sea April 10, waterlogged. The schooner's crew state that they remained on board the wreck of their vessel for a week after she lost her masts and became waterlogged, and that when they abandoned her they set her on fire. London, April 25 The British barque Mozambique, Captain Strachan, from Rio Janeiro, for New York, was spoken April 13 in lat. 5 S, long. 3'W. Signalled that five of her crew had died from yellow fever. London, April 25 It has been found unnecessary to dry dock the German steamer California, before reported damaged by collision at Hamburg with the collier Tyne-mouth. The work of repairing the steamer will be completed by Tuesday next. The British barque Maiden City, from Liverpool, previously reported ashore at Santos, in an exposed position, will prove a wreck. The Swedish barque Marianne, Captain Tjernberg, from London, November 27, for Darien, which was towed to Dover, December 7, in need of extensive repairs, has been sold and her hulk dismantled. San Francisco, April 25 The British ship Craigmore, bound from Newcastle, N.S., to San Francisco with a cargo of coal, is out 83 days, and not a few shipping and insurance men believe she burned at sea. The ships Nairnshire and Prince James, from Newcastle, are also causing a good deal of alarm. The Nairnshire is now over 130 days from Burmoh and the James is out over 100 days from South America. All three carry cargoes of Cardiff coal. St. John's, Nfld, April 23 The British steamer Clenlivet arrived here today from Cadiz, laden with salt. Her bow plates were crushed by her coming in contact with ice and she is leaking badly. She reports meeting heavy bodies of ice 150 miles off the coast. One hundred and thirty-eight icebergs of various sizes are in sight off Cape Race and are floating in the southern track of shipping. Detroit, Mich., April 25 The steamer Philip Minch, bound down in tow of the tug Thompson, collided with whaleback No. 101 in the river here yesterday. The pumps of the whaleback kept her free until Lake St. Clair was reached, when the water began to make very fast and the barge sank near the lightship; wreckers are working on the sunken vessel. She is laden and owned by the American Barge Company and is valued at $75,000.

Default,262,"It was ice, and lots of it, that impeded the progress of the freight steamship State of Georgia from Aberdeen to this port. She got in yesterday morning with her forepeak flooded to the water line and a hole nine feet long and four feet high in her starboard bow. She took a high northerly course, where her skipper might reasonably expect to find Arctic conditions, and, on March 13, east of the Banks of Newfoundland, she struck into pack ice that forced her to slow down to quarter speed. She tried to push her way through, but the further she steamed the thicker the ice seemed to get, and she was at length compelled to steer to the eastward. Then they discovered that she was leaking forward and detected the injury to her bow. Her progress was infinitesimal and when a thick fog came on Captain Laurie decided to stop her and let her drift, as he feared she might crash into an iceberg. At 8 a.m. the next day, while the ship was going ahead, the skipper saw through the mist what appeared to be a dense fog bank on the starboard. He kept on his course until he noticed that the fog bank had assumed a greenish hue. Then he knew that he was within hailing distance of a gigantic berg, and he put his helm hard up, and missed the apparition by less than a ship's length. The intense coldness of the air convinced the skipper that he was in the neighborhood of a fleet of bergs, and he proceeded with much caution. At 4 p.m. the ice and the fog were so thick that the ship's engines were stopped again, and she drifted with the packed ice. The pumps connected with the forepeak had been sounded, and it was found that the inrush of the sea was too much for them to clear. The collision bulkheads, just forward of the chain locker, had been closed, and the leakage was confined to the forepeak. While the ship was drifting Captain Laurie and the carpenter were lowered over the starboard bow on a staging and made an inspection of the damage. They decided that there was danger of the wound extending by the steady pressure of the ice, and they constructed a """"collision mat,"""" made of two timbers nine feet long, across which were nailed, as in a boardwalk, pieces of plank four feet long and two and a half inches thick. The face of this was covered with oakum. To the middle of each end timber a chain was fastened, and to the free end of each chain a hawser was bent. The chain and hawser on the lower edge of the mat were passed over to starboard under the ship's bow and made fast on deck on the port side. The chain and hawser on the upper edge were made taut as the mat was fitted over the breach caused by the ice. The lengths of chain were used because a hawser would have chafed on the keel and the rail. The nose of the steamship looked as if it were in a sling. A smaller patch was put over a hole in the ship's port bow. The work was finished at 7 p.m. and, the fog having lifted and revealed lighter ice to the southeast, the ship was headed that way. She passed a dozen or more bergs with fantastic towers, peaks and minarets, and many solid chunks of green ice that projected twenty feet above the water, and in a fog were more dangerous than bergs. Five hours after her wounds had been dressed the bandages were torn off by seas piled up by westerly gales. The skipper and his engineer and carpenter examined the collision damage, which was strengthened by chain piled in the chain locker, and decided that it was not necessary to bandage the ship's nose again. They were somewhat fearful when the seas were high, and they looked over the bow and saw, as the ship rose on a tall wave, the gaping wound, that more plates might be ripped off. Whenever the ship rose on a wave she spilled a cataract from the gap. The skipper contradicted a report that a submarine had tied into the hole. He said, however, that there was a small fish there yet, and that he proposed to secure it as a memento when the ship was put in dry dock. Mr. Fay mil' Critics, To the Editor of the Gazette: Sir, I would like to say to the party whose nom de plume is 'An Outsider' that it would be well if, before becoming too confused and dumbfounded in the toils and snares of doubt and fear, he would call on the Rev. Dr. A. trophies. These little emblems are in the shape of watch charms, and are very handsome as well as valuable. An Insurance Hatch, There is one good thing about insurance, and that is that the gentlemen engaged in it can afford to take chances that ordinary mortals would not. If anything should happen to them, of course, they are all insured in their own companies, and then they all know where the damages will come in. At least that was what people said last night when the ambulance bells disturbed the slumbers of the good people on Drummond street. They were simply caused by the urgent demands of various non-insured hockey players, who discovered that even moderately soft ice was considerably harder than the average insurance man's head. The headgear, too, was only a comparatively small portion of the anatomy injured. These gentlemen wisely refrained from getting themselves into trouble until the season was over, thereby not setting a bad example to any of their clients. The Guardians did not live up to their name. They were not guardians; in fact, they were rather the other thing and appeared as if they were standing in with the coroner and wanted a few more figures added to the mortality statistics that the London & Lancashire want to keep down. But the match that promises to be one of the features of annual sport took place, and there was not enough skin lost after all, as MacShaughnessy would say, to make a cornet of hussars. How they managed to amuse the spectators for a whole hour can only be appreciated by those who were there, for lives were insured on one side and the ice could not be burned. The match wound up by the Guardians taking the London & Lancashire men into camp with a score of 6 to 1. ATHLETICS; Valleyfield Amateur Athletic Association, The annual general meeting of the above association was held in the Town Hall in Valleyfield last evening, and the meeting was largely attended. The president, Mr. HICKELLAKEOCN, At the recent meeting on the ice track it will be remembered that a rather pretty looking little girl occupied a place in the judges' stand and was religiously taking notes. Burns' familiar quotation was never more apt: """"A chield's among you, taking notes,"""" and faith she printed them. She claimed to be the youngest lady journalist in the world, and she called her paper the Twentieth Century. Her second number has just been issued, and while she has not told horsemen anything they did not know before, she has worked in a very readable page of sporting news as well as theatrical matters.

Default,264,"S kindly assisted in the classification of the bones. In dealing with his subject, Dr. Dawson remarked that great interest attaches to any remains which, in countries historically so old, may indicate the residence of man before the dawn of history. In Egypt, nodules of flint are very abundant in the Eocene limestones, and where these have been wasted away, remain on the surface. In many places there is good evidence that the flint thus to be found everywhere has been, and still is, used for the manufacture of flukes, knives, and other implements. These, as is well known, were used for many purposes by the ancient Egyptians, and in modern times gun-flints and strike-lights still continue to be made. The debris of worked flints found on the surface is thus of little value as an indication of any flint-folk preceding the old Egyptians. It would be otherwise if flint implements could be found in the older gravels of the country. Some of these are of Pleistocene age, and belong to a period of partial submergence of the Nile Valley. Flint implements had been alleged to be found in those gravels, but there seemed to be no good evidence to prove that they are other than the chips broken by mechanical violence in the removal of the gravel by torrential action. In the Lebanon, numerous caverns exist. These were divided into two classes, with reference to their origin; some being water-caves or tunnels of subterranean rivers, others sea-caves, excavated by the waves when the country was at a lower level than at present. Both kinds have been occupied by man, and some of them undoubtedly at a time anterior to the Phoenician occupation of the country, and even at a time when the animal inhabitants and geographical features of the region were different from those of the present day. They were thus of various ages, ranging from the post-Glacial or Antediluvian period to the time of the Phoenician occupation. Dr. Dawson then remarked that many geologists in these days had an aversion to using the word """"Antediluvian,"""" on account of the nature of the work which, in years now gone by, unlearned people had attributed to the flood described in Scripture, but as the aversion to the use of that word was, he thought, not called for in these days, he hoped it would pass away. Speaking as a geologist, from a purely geological point of view, and from a thorough examination of the country around, there was no doubt that there was conclusive evidence that between the time of the first occupation of these caves by men—and they were men of a splendid physique—and the appearance of the early Phoenician inhabitants of the land, there had been a vast submergence of land, and a great catastrophe, aye a stupendous one, in which even the Mediterranean had been altered from a small sea to its present size. In illustration of this, the caverns at the Pass of Nahr-el-Kelb and at Ant Elias were described in some detail, and also, in connection with these, the occurrence of flint implements on the surface of modern sandstones at the Cape of Has near Beirut; these last were probably of much less antiquity than those of the more ancient caverns.

Default,266,"U1ASCE AND MADAGASCAR The French have taken the first step towards spending the recent vote of $12,500,000 by occupying Tamatave, and no doubt the news will be received at Paris with great enthusiasm, though this is only the first and simplest step in the undertaking. Evidently the whole nation has been smitten by the war fever. The legislative bodies could not withstand the pressure of popular excitement and passed the vote by large majorities. In their heart of hearts many members of the Senate and the Chamber probably know better, and would vote against the expedition if they dared. But France has got herself into such a position with regard to Madagascar that she must either go on or withdraw, and in the present state of public feeling withdrawal is impossible. What France is to gain by the expedition is not clear; and the loss she risks is not merely of money and soldiers' lives, but of national honor. No doubt France can crush Madagascar if she puts forth her energies, but the operation may be a very expensive one. The Hovas are said to have a reserve of 70,000 men, well supplied with rifles and modern artillery. The difficulty of the expedition is greatly increased by the nature of the country. Of the road from Tamatave to the capital, an English resident in Madagascar says: Speaking generally the route is an endless succession of hills. Here and there are short easy stages, but for the greater part the French troops will have to cut their way, two or three abreast at the most, in the beds of gullies made by the torrential rains. At other points they will have to cut their way through dense, fever-laden forest. Even with small parties it often happens that the porters have literally to drag one another out of the thick, red mud in which they sink to their waist. From the top of the hills and rocks a mere handful of Hovas could, without danger to themselves, seriously harass the troops toiling hundreds of feet below them. It is evident that the French force, which is to consist of 15,000 troops in the first instance, will have no easy task before them. If the Hovas have anything like the military discipline and modern weapons they are given credit for, they will offer a serious resistance, and it may be that the French will meet a more destructive foe in the malarial fever. Even if the Hovas give way and the expedition proves a success, what return is the French government likely to get for its expenditure? The island is said to be unsuitable for European colonization, and if it offered a good field, the French would not colonize it. The population of France is practically at a standstill, and the government has no need to seek room for expansion. It does so merely from a foolish national jealousy of England, whose small size and overflowing population make colonization and colonial trade an absolute necessity. The French of today have neither the circumstances nor the characteristics which impel young Englishmen to emigrate. The young Frenchman is happy at home; he thinks France the finest country in the world, and he looks upon emigration as exile. Before national feeling had reached its present fever heat, the oro spoke out plainly: France will never colonize Madagascar, and nobody wants it but those to whom the island will be the happy hunting-ground of functionaries, of exotic banks, and of railways without passengers or traffic. This is what will happen if all goes well; but if disaster comes, the story of Tonquin will be repeated, and the Government which is now keeping in power by yielding to the popular voice will be swept out of office amid universal execration. The news of the unexpected death of Robert Louis Stevenson will bring to many of his admirers the pain of a personal loss. His genial, beautiful, cheerful spirit endeared him to thousands who knew him, and in the passing away of such a gentle spirit English literature sustains a loss we can ill afford. Stevenson had none of the pessimism and cynicism which mark some of our modern novelists. He was thoroughly human, and it is his entire humanity that gives his stories their greatest charm. It is because of this quality that we follow with breathless interest the adventures of his freebooters and wild Highland men and simple Lowland youths or English sailor boys. He had also in high degree the gift of romantic imagination. For the first time in English literature he united the pictureness of Scott with the exactness of Defoe. Careful workmanship and distinction of style made his books as delightful to the literary critic as to the schoolboy. No greater boon can be given to the young people than to make them acquainted with his stirring tales and charming essays. The next move against the liquor trade in this province is to be for the purpose of separating the sale of intoxicants from that of other articles of merchandise. The host of petitions presented in the Legislature yesterday is evidently the reconnaissance in force that is intended to precede the real attack. There are such reasons in favor of the change asked for that it has been adopted in many places. The temperance element has been having so much to say in shaping the laws here of late, too, that it is not unlikely that Quebec may before long be among them. There will be a great outcry from the Lancashire cotton spinners at the renewal of the proposal to levy a tax on cotton imports into India; but so long as the theory is held that India is governed for her own benefit and not for the advantage of England, one does not see how for the sake of English interests the administrators of Indian affairs can be restrained from doing what they say is absolutely necessary for India's welfare. At the same time, it is a severe blow to the Manchester school of free trade delivered in their tenderest spot: their pockets. Sir Charles H. Tupper appears by the reports to have been subjected to a good many interruptions at some of his British Columbia meetings. Liberals, when they feel they are getting the worst of the situation, have a weakness for resorting to such tactics. One of the worst interrupted meetings ever held in Canada was that in the Montreal drill shed, called by the Conservatives, just previous to the overthrow of the provincial Liberals in 1892. Before it Montreal had two Conservatives in the Legislature; after it she had six. The conduct of the Toronto Street Railway Co. in employing detectives to watch the judge and counsel conducting the boodling investigation is, to say the least of it, most extraordinary. When suspected persons employ detectives to investigate the private lives of the magistracy it is getting things down pretty fine, and a boodler has been correctly defined by a Montreal judge as the meanest kind of thief. Mr. Gigault's report on the success of the dairy industry in Denmark shows that Canada has yet abundant room for expansion in that direction. Close attention to the peculiarities of the English market is the first condition of success, and on this head the report contains suggestions to which Quebec farmers will do well to give heed.

Default,267,"BRITISH LIVE STOCK Cooler Weather Brings Better Prices for Cattle BUT MARKET STILL LOW Details of the Market - Only Three to Three and a Half Cents Paid in Canada Can Make Money (From our own Correspondent) Liverpool, July 18 After fourteen days' dreadfully hot weather, a complete change in the atmospheric conditions now prevails almost generally throughout the Kingdom, and instead of sweltering under 87 to 90 in the shade, we are slipping on an extra coat and wondering how it can feel so cold at 65. The change has been decidedly beneficial to the meat and cattle trade, and although it only made itself apparent on Thursday, it seems likely to keep up for a few days. Values for cattle are from to 1c stronger, and lightweight beasts of good quality might have made 1c more. The run of stock, however, from Canada and the States, has, as a rule, been to the heavy side, and consequently it has not been possible to make the most of the change. Advices from London report a steadier demand at Deptford and a fair good clearance at Smithfield. This will give some encouragement to our Birkenhead operators and induce a more active demand. Altogether the prospect is not so bad, and if exporters can now buy suitable stock at 3c to 3½c, and ship them on a 40s or 42s 6d freight, they can stand our markets with some degree of composure. LONDON DEPTFORD Monday's supply of 3,535 beasts, compared with Monday last, showed an increase of 937 head, and consisted of 1,710 from the States, 1,864 from Canada (the largest consignment this season), and 431 from South America. Owing to the large number on offer, combined with the hot weather, trade was very dull, rates being fully 1d per lb in favor of buyers for prime quality, and a still further decline for seconds, at which sales had to be forced and a clearance was almost impossible. The very best States and Canadians made 2s 1½d to 3s per lb. Argentines nominally quoted at 2s 4d to 2s 6d. The sheep supply, amounting to 1,987, was 171 larger than on Monday last, and consisted of shipments from Argentina. Trade was steady with an earlier clearance than usual. Best pens made 3s 1½d per 8 lbs. The following were the numbers on offer on the corresponding day, with the current top rates: Beasts, 2,873, 3s 10d to 3s 11d per 8 lbs; sheep, 4,115, 3s 10d to 4s per 8 lbs. On Thursday trade improved remarkably owing to the clearance reported at Smithfield (but forced at shocking prices) and the cooler weather following upon the heavy torrential rains pretty general over the country. The supply consisted of 1,538 States and 337 Canadian cattle. This did not, however, include all arrivals, a good many being kept in reserve for Monday and also to fill any requirements on Friday, Saturday or Sunday, the demand at times for extra orders occasionally helping out a bad sale on Thursday. Some good States and Canadians made up to 4½d, say 9c, but the current top rate for fair to good bullocks was 9c. No Argentines on offer. The sheep trade was quite active the short supply (900 South Americans and 57 Canadians) enabling sellers to put up the price to 6d (12½c) for picked pens of Argentines, the average of sales as they ran was quite 12c. The Canadian sheep were not a gilt-edged lot, and at 1s 1d (11½c) were well sold. A very much better trade is looked for next week, as the offerings are not likely to be too weighty.",1,18960728,historical,torrential,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Default,268,"JUBILEE HELPS PRICES Butchers Take Advantage of It to Mark Up Their Goods - The Leading Market (From our own correspondent Liverpool, May 1) The general course of business in the principal open markets of the country is, on the whole, satisfactory, and for the best descriptions of cattle and sheep prices are well sustained. Lambs are coming forward more plentifully, but their condition is below the average, owing to the bleak weather experienced for some weeks back. As regards imported stock sales this week show a slight falling off in values - Glasgow values perhaps excepted, partly due to the heavy supplies and partly owing to the weather, which, for a couple of days, was very thundery and accompanied by torrential showers. So far as can be estimated the outlook for this season is still favorable to the Canadian exporter, as all the conditions that lead up to good markets are everywhere noticeable. These may again be briefly stated here, although I have already referred to them. To begin with, the war is virtually over, and although this may seem a very remote contingency or disturbing element in connection with our Canadian cattle shipping still, as affecting business generally, it must be taken into account. Then the supplies of native cattle and sheep are very moderate; indeed, in some districts there is a shortage on both, while the quality of native mutton is admittedly below the average. In the industrial centres an unusually active state of affairs is reported, the shipbuilding, engineering, iron and coal industries particularly enjoying the benefit of big orders in hand. These branches cover a wide area of industrial England including, of course, Scotland and Wales. The manufacturing districts in Lancashire, the Midland Counties, with Birmingham, Leicester and Sheffield thrown in, all report trade satisfactory, which is about as much as the phlegmatic Britisher can be brought to admit, even if he is coining money. Arthur Soavn, the diamond jubilee commemoration is expected to bring an extra million of people to the capital, and as they must bring with them at least a tenner, that means a wonderful addition to the turnover of the London shopkeeper. Of course the tenner will not be all spent in meat and drink, but a share of it must go to the hotel, restaurant, or boarding-house keeper, and thus indirectly to the butcher and baker. Already the astute, far-seeing carver of carcasses is putting his prices up on the score of its being jubilee year, you know, and if a customer wants to know why such an event should offer good and sufficient cause for adding a penny per pound to his meat, he is informed with a mysterious air that things are awful dear to buy, especially the extra choice meat as I have to get for such customers as you. Here is a specimen letter from the London Echo: BUTCHERS AND BEEF Sir, The butcher with whom I have been dealing for the past few years has raised all his beef 1d a pound, and gives as his reason for doing so that it is the Jubilee year. I cannot but think it would be a matter of public interest to know if this sort of imposition is to be general in this heavily-burdened and long-suffering metropolis. I am, sir, your obedient servant. Now, if the butcher is going to raise his price, the wholesale man is not above doing the same, and in turn why should not the live stock salesman get another half sovereign for his client, the Canadian exporter, who has in days gone by put many a fiver in the pockets of them all. Thus it goes round. John Bull is to pay more for his bit of meat, and all those interested in shipping it, slaughtering it, selling it, and serving it, have to be helped out of it. And now we infer from all the different items set forth above that the export season should be good, and that from the Manitoba ranches in the lovely Northwest to the sunny-faced butcher in the crowded quarters of Liverpool, Manchester, London and Glasgow, there will be the happiest possible recollections of Her Gracious Majesty's wonderful reign. The picture is so bright and cheerful one can hardly think it possible there is another side to it. And yet there is. I forbear, however, from dwelling on it, simply contenting myself by remarking that freights on United States cattle have jumped up 10s a head already, which would suggest that somebody else was going to have a bit out of the jubilee profit besides the butcher and the cattle exporter and not a little bit either.",1,18970514,historical,torrential,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Torrential rains are inundating the entrenchments, rendering the work of defence difficult. The numbers of sick among the troops are increasing, making the situation very distressing, and causing increased desertions of the native soldiers. It is estimated that the insurgents number 30,000 armed with rifles, and 100,000 armed with swords, etc. Aguinaldo has summoned me to surrender but I have treated his proposals with disdain, for I am resolved to maintain the sovereignty of Spain and the honor of the king to the last extremity. I have over one thousand sick and 200 wounded. The citadel has been invaded by the suburban inhabitants, who have abandoned their homes owing to the barbarity of the rebels. These inhabitants constitute an embarrassment, aggravating the situation, in view of the bombardment, which, however, is not seriously apprehended for the moment. The Governor of the Visayas and Mindanao Islands cables that he has defeated the insurgents in an engagement during which Chief Arec, Aguinaldo's representative, was killed. He adds that tranquility now prevails throughout these islands, and he further asserts that the principal Malay chiefs of the Mindanao group declare they desire to fight on the side of the Spaniards. Madrid, June 28 Advices from Manila state that Captain-General Augusti's family is still in the hands of the insurgents. General Pena, with a thousand soldiers, has surrendered. His soldiers, most of whom were natives, joined the insurgents. A majority of the detachments in the Island of Luzon have surrendered owing to their lack of food, though some succeeded in escaping. Numerous Spaniards, including the Governors of Uatanga, Laguna and Dulacana, have taken refuge at Cavite. The rebels who are besieging Manila exceed 25,000 men.

The men encamped are exposed to the weather, and unless a forward movement occurs soon much sickness is inevitable, as the camp is on low-lying land, not easily drained. According to the present plans it is probable a demand for the surrender of Manila will be sent to Captain-General Augustin. If surrender is refused the fleet will attack in front and the First and Second brigades, under General Anderson, will advance southeast through San Pedro, Macatu and Wanduolayon, upon the Spanish positions at Santa Mesa and Santa Anna. If Captain-General Augustin surrenders, the American troops will land at Manila, the troops at Camp Dewey holding the insurgents in check. General Anderson will not co-operate with the insurgents. General Greene, commanding Camp Dewey, has established outposts entirely regardless of the position of Aguinaldo's soldiers.

Supplies on the open market still continue liberal, owing to prospects of Winter beef being so poor, but this premature disposal will probably now be checked, as in many districts there is quite a marvellous recovery of aftergrowth. A feature of the trade at Deptford has been the complete absence of South American cattle and sheep. This is attributed to the stringent rules and regulations enforced by the Argentine Government which came into operation on 1st August. It is said that shipowners object to the serious liability imposed by these regulations, and have refused point-blank to carry cattle at any price. So far Argentine shippers have not lost much, and as this is the quiet season with them, we presume shipowners and exporters are bluffing the Government a bit, and at the same time seeing what effect it has on markets this side.",1,18990919,historical,torrential,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Default,272,"A PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY, Calve's Carmen is a psychological study worthy of much deeper analysis; but perhaps what strikes the ordinary observer more is the extraordinary versatility and power of the actress. Carmen's torrential passions require an energy of expression within the capabilities of very few on the tragic stage today; her fierce blazes of anger cannot be expressed by poise and fury; they come from the very depths of her nature. With the startling suddenness of a summer thunderstorm, these outbursts of concentrated passion break in upon Carmen's gentler moods. One moment she is all smiles and witchery; the next a demon of malice and hatred. How Calve expresses all this and brings it home to the most careless observer cannot be told in cold print. Her lissome grace of movement, suggestive of the tigeress or the serpent, her wonderful play of feature, from her arch raillery in the first scene to the dumb horror and amazement with which she faces her fate as told by the cards, her last cry as she flees from death all this is beyond description, and it would be worse than useless to attempt it.",1,18991018,historical,torrential,0,0,0,0,0,0,

About 9 o'clock the steamer Pilot was at Barras wharf, Levis, when suddenly an enormous mass of ice caught it and pinned it to the wharf, causing considerable damage. It was torn from its fastenings and was being drifted away. It needed all the ability of the captain and crew to prevent a serious accident. Fortunately the steamer got safely up the river to its own wharf. It is said that a deputation from the Quebec Board of Trade will proceed to Ottawa in a few days to wait on the Premier and his colleagues on the ocean mail subsidy question. The deputation will be very strong and representative of the leading interests of the place. The people of the town of Chicoutimi and of Hebertville are organizing a great excursion to Quebec, via the Lake St. John railway, on the occasion of the opening of the Provincial Legislature. A number of merchants from Chicoutimi have been in town since the beginning of the winter, all coming by rail, although the distance from Chicoutimi to Lake St. John is so considerable. Goods to and from Chicoutimi are also sent by this route. There is a rumor on the street, which is given for what it is worth, to the effect that a swap is on the tapis by which Hon.

NEW GRAIN STANDARDS For Manitoba Wheat Strongly Denounced by the Toronto Board of Trade Toronto, December 28 The grain and flour sections of the Board of Trade met this afternoon to consider the order-in-council changing the present standard of grain for Manitoba and the Northwest. After a warm discussion the following resolution was passed by the grain section and ordered to be telegraphed to Mr. Hull, Inland Revenue department, Ottawa: """"That, whereas an order-in-council has been passed changing the grades of Manitoba wheat, which will disarrange and cause endless trouble in carrying out contracts already entered into for future delivery on the basis of present grades, as well as necessitating the withdrawal of all samples now in the hands of foreign buyers and the furnishing of new standards, thereby causing great delay and cessation of business operations; therefore, be it resolved, that this board desires to express its strong feeling of disapprobation at the changing of grain standards by the governor-in-council without consulting the commercial interests of the country through their various channels; and would, therefore, move that the council of this Board of Trade take such action in the matter as they may deem best to obtain, if possible, the remanding of the order-in-council until such time as all interested are consulted and their views ascertained."""" The flour section passed the following resolutions: Resolved, """"That whereas an order-in-council has been passed amending the standard of Manitoba wheat, and which is fraught with most pressing import to all millers and flour dealers, any change at this time when the grades are fixed, approved and known, is undesirable and likely to obstruct business and also involve in litigation all contracts of sale fixed and still executed. Resolved that this section deprecates the fact that any change in existing standards of grain is not possible, not coming through the regular constituted board of grain examiners, who should be, in our opinion, the only authority possible.""""

Default,275,"-K-A, BK mm, ilV KB mm n, n We all take water too much for granted. We use it as if it were an endless resource. But imagine if you turned on the tap one day and nothing came out. Or if our water had to be boiled and purified before drinking. I'm not talking about the situation in many countries where clean, drinkable water is a precious commodity, and even usable water is scarce. Water shortages aren't only happening in desert regions. Even on the North American continent there are places where reservoirs become low enough to require summer water rationing. Those of you in many Montreal Island municipalities have only to think back to last summer to remember the garden watering restrictions imposed in the middle of the season. All this in a province that prides itself on water as a renewable resource, and in a country that holds nearly one-fifth of the world's fresh water. I'm not suggesting that we're going to run out of water right after your next shower, but there will be more and more limits to our consumption in the future, and as gardeners we may be part of the problem. We waste a lot more water than we have the right to, and it's not necessary. What we have to do as responsible gardeners is set things up so less water is used, less is wasted, but plant growth is not adversely affected. Save rainwater. It's not difficult. It all depends on how you irrigate, what type of soil you have, using mulch properly, and your choice of plants. First, try to save rainwater in a barrel. And don't waste what's called gray water, the leftover from washing or rinsing. Use what you can, as long as it's not full of grease or detergents. Using a sprinkler is the least efficient way to irrigate a garden. It's a good distributor of water to a lawn, but it's very poor for anything else. Much of what sprays out is lost to evaporation or the wind, particularly if it's a fine spray. You can make better use of it on the lawn if you turn down the pressure until the jets are rather thick streams and you can keep them from going too high. Garden beds with plants need the water delivered where it will do the most good to the roots. This means gently applying it on or reduce moisture to cut Q. Our turn-of-the-century townhouse has two very large skylights. One is about 4 by 4 feet and the other is about 8 by 12 feet. They are both in good condition. They each have a ventilating pipe in the center. In the winter, moist air rises through these pipes and condensation drips down onto the glass below them. The amount of water that can accumulate is very significant. Certainly they do not work very efficiently to remove hot air in summer. Can you recommend a remedy? This is a tricky question. Some experts have long been in favor of blocking off the vent; others are in favor of keeping it open as the vent does work to keep air circulating. The Victorian skylight serves two functions. The first and most obvious is that it allows light to enter the dark upper reaches of buildings that have complete walls on two or more sides. The second is that it provides a certain amount of air circulation; it provides a way for the pressurized air that builds up in a house to escape. Normally what should happen is that with one or two windows open on various different floors during North Hatley antiques show set for weekend Rare antiques as diverse as cabinet doors and art-deco jewelry will be featured at the North Hatley Antique Show and Sale this weekend.

A long-nose watering can is among STUART ROBERTSON GARDENING under the soil surface. You can soak the surface with a long-nosed watering can that has a rose on the end to make a gentle spray, or you can use a hose with a soaker nozzle on the end that splits up the spray into lots of tiny streams. Both of these methods will apply plenty of water but not in such a way as to disturb the plants or erode the soil. Don't use a pistol-grip or fogging nozzle for the same reasons as the lawn sprinkler. The latter is not efficient, and the former is downright dangerous with its strong jet. Delivering water underground directly to the roots needs a bit more planning, but is even simpler once installed. You'll need some form of irrigation tubing that can be buried a couple of inches beneath the surface and snaked around the plants. Several systems are available for easy home installation that are made of recycled plastic. They have thousands of tiny pores in the tubing that allow a slow and steady flow of water to garden beds. In the summer, the air circulates up to the skylight and zips out through the vent. Of course, for this to happen, the skylight windows should be open. Even in extremely large skylights, there should be one or two sashes, or individual windows that open by a rope and pulley mechanism. Unfortunately, with time, the ropes often go missing in action. I strongly suspect that this is what has happened in your case. If this is so, try propping them open, or reinstalling the sash cord through the pulley and leaving them open during the day and night, to help vent off the hot air. While you are working in the skylight shaft, you may find it worth your while to throw two or more coats of a high-gloss alkyd paint. The other is circa 18th century in its original blue color. Obsession Antique Ltd. of Montreal specializes in jewelry and this year features some very elegant finds, such as an art-deco group consisting of a brooch, necklace, earrings and bracelet.

And there'll be music - it's called the festival of flowers and music. Limits are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., both the most efficient methods for delivering flow of water to the root zone whenever you turn on the tap. Most allow for the addition of organic fertilizer into the stream. Over the course of a few hours you can efficiently deliver a measured amount of water to the critical part of your garden, keeping the surface quite dry and robbing small weeds of the moisture they need to flourish. And new electronic timers turn the water on and off even if you're not around to supervise. However, the efficiency of an irrigation system depends on the type of soil you have. In clay soil the water is absorbed slowly and spreads sideways but doesn't penetrate very deeply. The surface evaporates quickly and turns into a hard cake. In sandy soil it flows downwards quickly but doesn't spread over a very wide area and some can even be lost to the depths. Moisture and nutrients are soon depleted. In a sandy loam you get the best of both worlds, with water penetrating to a good depth but also spreading and being absorbed for later use. Working on your soil to get it to this consistency is obviously the best goal if we want deep-rooted plants that can last much longer in dry spells without showing ill effects. Mulching is the third essential. If you're applying the water efficiently, the next objective is to keep it from being lost to evaporation by the wind and sun. Covering any exposed soil surface will considerably reduce this loss, and will also deter skylight condensation preferably white, onto the skylight shaft itself. This will help reflect more natural light into the house during the winter, and protect the wood or plaster of the shaft. As to the condensation itself, I can't really think of any perfectly good solutions. You shouldn't try blocking the vent with something like foam rubber or glass fiber; this would only lead to the moist air being trapped in the shaft and condensing on other nearby cold glass surfaces. Probably your best way to deal with the situation is to caulk the lower windows, the ones that should be operated by a pulley, in place with a strippable caulk, this should stop the air from reaching the upper, colder reaches of the skylight and condensing. However, warm moist air might still find a way of infiltrating the skylight and condensing. For that reason, the vent must remain functional to allow this moisture to go outside. Check all the caulk in the skylight, and the putty holding the window panes in place on the skylight and the bottom window. Replace any that is rotten. In the process, you may want to install a new thermopane, or glazed insulating glass unit in the bottom.

Perhaps a bit more elegant would be compost, dried manure, leaf mold, dried grass clippings, shredded bark or wood chips. The organic mulches mentioned decompose to help the soil structure and most of them add nutrients as they do so. This blanket over the soil also maintains a consistent moisture level around the roots so growth is steady and not interrupted every time there's a slight drying of the soil. The last essential to a water-wise garden is to use the right plants in the right places. Areas that are heavily exposed to the sun will suffer the most from water loss, so they should have plants that are deep-rooted and slightly drought-tolerant. Try annuals such as arctotis (African daisy), cornflower, dwarf morning glory, dimorphoteca (Cape marigold), California poppy, gaillardia, mirabilis, nasturtiums, annual phlox, portulaca, salvia splendens and zinnias. Also such perennials as achillea, anthemis, coreopsis, dianthus, echinops, gazania, gypsophila, phlox, potentilla or rudbeckia. If you position these plants properly you can also make sure the foliage of each grows to meet its neighbor, therefore providing a kind of living mulch or cover to keep the moisture in the soil. All in all, setting yourself up this way to use less water should give better results in your garden. But all this work should really not be necessary: it should function reasonably well without the new glass. This leads me to believe that perhaps your household is producing too much moisture in winter, and that reducing the amount produced is the key to the solution. Do you have a humidifier running during the winter? Is your clothes dryer vented to the outside? Is there a kitchen vent? Do you take a lot of hot showers without leaving a window open to vent off the steam? I would examine my winter living patterns before going to the trouble of installing a thermopane or rebuilding the whole skylight. And if all else fails, all you should have to do is open a window for a bit to vent out the moist air causing the problem.

I have just come from my parents' farm in Northumberland County, about an hour or so's drive west of Kingston near Lake Ontario. It's difficult to fathom, since we seem to be living through Nordic monsoons here in Montreal, but they also have been experiencing a drought. Well, drought is a relative word here. My parents haven't had rain for many weeks. Their gardens drooped; their soil was hot and dusty underfoot. The lawns were like shredded wheat. And the old well was low. We had to be very careful with the water. That was more of a nuisance than anything else, what with the mob of people there. Bathwater got shared several times (shaving of legs forbidden). We flushed the toilet only every third or fourth time. We never could run the tap to brush teeth or wash gritty lettuce leaves or have the hottest water to fill the kettle or rinse dishes for the dishwasher. Yes, the dishwasher. Isn't that ludicrous? In the middle of a dry spell, we still used the dishwasher. Well, we have 11 people at meals, we said. We have to. The fact is, we're spoiled brats. We know very little about conserving, really, and even less about deprivation. We cannot even begin to comprehend what it's like to depend for our survival on something that is well and truly gone. Like water. Like crops and cattle. Like northern cod. In the middle of the lush Montreal summer, I've been trying to fathom the agony. What's chilling is that it is the killing of the elephants that has sharpened the blade of the African tragedy for me. I've been reading for months of the drought and sighing, despairing, clucking my tongue as I do for almost everything that is they believed I must be an important person and told her she would be allowed to fly with her children. The current rescue is far from complete. Due to political and military restrictions, Berjan's husband can't leave Yugoslavia. Berjan herself knows she will have to return, but has no idea how or when. Berjan's mother Zarifa, Kabilio-Greenberg's childhood playmate, is hiding out in a village near Sarajevo. It's been a month since anyone in Jerusalem has spoken to her on the telephone. Still alive and hiding in a basement of a Sarajevo house is Berjan's disabled grandmother, Zejneda Hardaga, now 73. It was Hardaga and her husband, Mustafa, who sheltered the Kabilio family in Yugoslavia during World War II. Zejneda and Mustafa Hardaga lived across from a German police station in Sarajevo when they took in young Tova Kabilio, her mother Rifka and father Joseph and brother Benjamin after the Kabilio house was destroyed. Kabilio-Greenberg remains astonished at the courage of her family's rescuers because a sign on the German police station warned that anyone caught hiding Jews would be executed. When Kabilio-Greenberg's father was taken to an Italian-run work camp in Yugoslavia, the Hardaga family tracked him down and sent him food. Katsarkas now is testing Gyura in the lab to try to find out what's causing his problem. Most dizziness problems, Katsarkas said, are caused by defects in the body's vestibular system, which is situated near the inner ear. The system tells the brain how the head is moving in relation to the rest of the body. For example, the system allows us to keep our eyes fixed on something while our head is moving. It also monitors the pull of gravity and sends signals to muscles to keep our balance when we are moving. When you lose your vestibular functions, you have less posture control, you cannot control your eyes and you have all sorts of other problems. Katsarkas has identified more than 40 diseases that cause dizziness, but he said he still can't diagnose 25 percent of the patients who come to his lab. While the lab is mainly used to treat patients, Katsarkas also deals with legal and insurance cases.

Laidlaw denies cleanup liability Antoine Landry, communications manager of Laidlaw Environmental Services Ltd, said yesterday that a story in The Gazette on Tuesday could have been misleading. The story dealt mainly with the fact that the Quebec Environment Department had sent a letter to Laidlaw about contamination of lagoons beside the company's toxic-waste incinerator in Mercier. In the story, Landry was quoted as saying that the government shares responsibility for a cleanup. This suggested that Laidlaw accepted some responsibility for the problem at the lagoons, but Landry said yesterday that he had been talking at the time about a different pollution problem. He said that Laidlaw denied all liability or responsibility for the problem at the lagoons. Landry also insisted that the headline was misleading. It said, """"Multimillion-dollar waste cleanup ordered."""" Landry said the letter from the government merely had asked Laidlaw to submit a cleanup plan within 30 days. Landry said that the company had so far been given no order from St. Lambert. In fact, Letendre is from St. Lambert. The Gazette regrets the error.

Within half an hour a hundred houses were on fire. They were generally the dwellings of poor artisans and laborers, and it was a heart-rending spectacle to see the poor people gathering their few household goods together and carrying them to perhaps some place where the fire reached them a few minutes after, perhaps to a place of safety.

Regardless of how superior we might feel we are, we are servants of nature. It controls us, not vice-versa. And ironically, destroying nature increases our dependence. When we encroach on it through overpopulation, overdevelopment, overuse, we pay by becoming needy. We always realize this in crisis, when it's too late when we've mismanaged, upset the balance. When we face loss. In this land of plenty, we don't think much about loss. Most of us have what we want as often as we want it. We fill our baskets at the supermarket. We run our hoses for hours to wash our cars, water our lawns. We invade sparkling lakes with our bodies and our noisy boats. But we are always on the brink of loss of some kind. I'm thinking, for example, of the St. Lawrence River, whose vision I'm privileged to live with every day. From my study window, its elegant sweep belies its deadly reality. How we continue to take it for granted! The loss of the Newfoundland cod-fishing industry is Canada's drought. It is a hefty and poignant cry for awareness to us all how the loss of a resource threatens - not only individuals, but a region, a country. The destructive implications are far-reaching. But greater than their cost which is partially reparable, for now is the ineffable shame of the situation. We have once again tipped the balance of precious nature and may ourselves be forced to eat elephants. As this city's oldest newspaper, The Gazette has been recording Montreal's history since 1778.

Default,276,"THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, MAY 18, 1995 SSH 7 The laminated look Shopping for wood flooring? New products might be your answer If you thought high-quality hardwood flooring had to be made of solid hardwood, there's good news for you and the environment. One of the fastest-growing segments of the hardwood flooring industry is a new generation of products - laminated hardwood products. This new breed of flooring features a laminated construction that uses heat and pressure to bond up to five layers of hardwood into a single, highly stable, highly durable homogeneous flooring unit. Not only are these products top quality, but they offer the same design versatility as solid products and installation options not always possible with solid planks or parquets. More importantly, they maximize the use of every tree harvested. There are two key reasons for the move to laminated products, according to Vicki Dryden, vice-president of sales and marketing for Harris-Tarkett, one of the leading producers of prefinished laminated flooring products in the United States. """"Advanced technology is one reason for the shift,"""" she says. """"Our industry has moved in the last 20 years from one of blades and saws to one of highly sophisticated computer technology, which allows us to make the most of the raw materials we use. This technology is responsible for the precise milling and curing that creates today's laminated products."""" The second reason for the shift to laminated products is an environmental one, said Dryden. """"Although most wood flooring manufacturers harvest their raw materials from managed forests, our collective goal is to maximize this valuable resource,"""" she says. """"Because we only need a one-seventh-inch-thick top layer of first-quality hardwood, rather than the three-quarter-inch thick piece required for a solid plank, for example, we can maximize the lumber from each board we mill,"""" she said. The savings in raw materials with this process is most obvious when you consider an average flooring installation, she said. """"A two and one-quarter-inch-wide piece of unfinished solid strip oak flooring requires four times as much top-grade hardwood to cover an area as compared to a Longstrip laminated product, one that is produced in planks to resemble strip flooring when installed,"""" she said. A key purchasing influence when choosing wood flooring is the design and installation versatility. Laminated products meet these purchasing needs as well, said Dryden. """"Harris-Tarkett's newest laminated introduction, the Perennial Collection, for example, is available in the industry's two leading species: red oak and maple."""" There also is a range of five colors, including white, although the top seller continues to be natural, adds Dryden. The Perennial Collection offers LES ENTREPRISES Ba(aX ENTERPRISES Lawn Care Painting Excavation Fences Patio Interior & Exterior Renovation Spring Clean Up FREE ESTIMATE COMPETITIVE PRICES Richard Dalpe LANDSCAPING CONTRACTOR Specialist in Cedar Hedges Environmental friendly: Laminated wood uses less raw materials Making certain you don't stunt new trees' growth Establishing trees on your lot is an important step, and landscaping professionals suggest you buy the largest trees you can afford. However, there is another factor even more important than their cost. The faster the trees grow, the sooner you will have cooling shade and a look of permanence for your lot. Homeowners sometimes lose or stunt young trees because of some common mistakes. Lack of water is the biggest danger. It takes a new tree up to three years to develop roots to make up for those lost in transplanting. During that time, they are vulnerable to drought. Moreover, when first transplanted, trees have so few roots that they may not even be able to take up all the water available. If new trees wilt badly, prune some of the top branches to balance the loss of roots. You can also shower the foliage until wilting stops. To water the roots, make a donut-like depression a few inches deep and 2 to 3 feet from the trunk so water will not run off. Not long ago, a dish-like depression extending the same distance around the tree was considered ideal. But the donut works better because it prevents puddling around the trunk, where water could cause rot. Water deeply - as much as 5 gallons for a 3-to 4-foot tree - each week that there is less than 1 inch of rainfall. Wrapping and staking are sometimes required by nurseries if their guarantee is to be honored. Wrapping the lower trunk with tree wrap or heavy paper will prevent sunburn until the canopy of leaves grows enough to shade the trunk. Wrapping also prevents some damage from insects and power tools, such as lawn mowers and trimmers. Use masking tape, and leave the wrap in place. Staking was, until recently, a rule without exception. New research, however, has shown that some sway is necessary for trees to develop strength and resilience. Too much swaying will keep the roots constantly under stress and prevent them from settling and spreading. So, use the minimum staking necessary, perhaps none for small transplants. Remove ties to test the tree for strength, and take out stakes when you're sure they're not needed. Another danger to trees is girdling. This often happens to new trees that come with a wire label loosely attached. As the tree grows, the trunk or branch grows so much in circumference that the wire is embedded in the bark. Growth will then be restricted, and there will be a swelling above this point. Laminated products are easy to care for. Most are prefinished at the factory, two widths: a 2 and one-quarter-inch-wide strip and a 3-inch-wide plank, both with the option of a square-edge design or a slightly eased edge. """"The good news for the homeowner and home remodeler is that the laminated products offer the same design versatility as a solid product,"""" she said. There are also installation advantages. """"Laminated products are inherently dimensionally stable,"""" said Dryden. """"This means they are often the better choice in areas of high humidity since they resist the swelling and shrinking that can occur with solid products."""" From an installation point of view, the most versatile laminated product is the Longstrip product, produced in 8-foot planks to resemble strip flooring when installed. Longstrip is the only laminated product that can be permanently installed without the use of nails or adhesives, added Dryden. Laminated products are easy to care for. Most are prefinished at the factory and feature a tough polyurethane coating for a durable, yet easy-care surface that requires no waxing for routine maintenance.

H 68 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, MAY 18, 1995 Baths that are made of cast acrylic can do that much better than those made of ordinary material, experts say. Money-saving tips on remodeling your bathtub Make sure the tub you choose can withstand the rigors of family life. Experts report that baths made of cast acrylic can do that much better than those made of ordinary materials. Before you plunge into buying a new bath or shower, here are some money-saving tips and important facts that should wash well with style-conscious homeowners: 1. When remodeling, if you do your own demolition, it's messy but fairly easy, and it can save hundreds of dollars. 2. When designing your bath, avoid moving plumbing fixtures and relocating drains and supply lines. 3. Try to keep walls and windows where they are; structural changes can be very expensive. 4. Choose a material that is both beautiful and durable. Lucite cast acrylic, for example, is one of the more popular materials for tubs and showers. This beautiful material is commonly used for top-quality, large contoured tubs. The material features deep, rich colors, easy maintenance with common household cleaners and long-lasting durability. Beware of bargain-priced bathware; they may not be built to last, and you could end up replacing them in a few short years. Avoid making major changes once remodeling work has started. When tradespeople have to backtrack, the bill can grow alarmingly. Make gardening easier with the right equipment. Carving out a garden is a difficult chore without the right tools. Start with a few basics, as listed below. As your interest in gardening and landscaping grows, keep adding to your tool inventory to lessen your workload. Remember: Although forged tools are more expensive, they are more durable. 1. Spade (either with a straight or D-shape handle) for breaking new ground, general digging, and mixing soil. 2. Spading fork for breaking up soil or moving well-rooted plants. 3. Hard-toothed metal rake for smoothing soils, breaking up dirt clods, or gathering garden debris. 4. Lightweight metal rake serves as a broom for your garden. 5. Hoe for cultivating, removing weeds. 6. Scuffle (pronged hoe) for bigger jobs and cultivating in tight areas. 7. Trowel for digging small holes for individual plants. 8. Claw for cultivating tight areas. 9. Shrub clipper for pruning and cutting shrubs and small vines and sticks for your compost pile. 10. Two-handed lopper for bigger pruning tasks. 11. Dandelion lifter for removing dandelions and other long-rooted weeds. 12. A 5 x 8-inch hose for watering. 13. Watering can for individual plants. 14. Wheelbarrow for hauling dirt, large plants, and compost. 15. Bucket for smaller hauling chores. Proper ways to prune your roses It may seem like you're taking a step backward to cut away healthy wood from a rose, but it's actually in the rose's best interest. Pruning is necessary to control the size and shape of a plant and to keep it healthy, vigorous, and covered in blooms. If you fail to prune, the rosebush will soon become tall and rangy and produce few good flowers. Pruning should be done before the buds break, just after they have begun to swell. Timing will range from mid-winter to mid-spring, depending on your climate. If forsythia blooms in your neighborhood, prune roses when yellow forsythia buds begin to show. It's important to use the right tools for the job. Curved-edge pruning shears are better than straight-edge anvil types, which can crush the stems as they are cut. Use a long-handled lopper or a pruning saw for thick canes. Where winterkill does not force you into a lower pruning height, cut hybrid tea, floribunda, and grandiflora canes to a height of 12 to 18 inches. Floribundas can be left taller and fuller for increased flowering capabilities. The hybrid perpetuals should have only the oldest canes removed. Prune shrub and old garden roses just to shape them and to remove dead wood. Prune minis to about half of their summer height; shape them according to their use in your landscape. Tree roses are pruned like bush roses, but they must be kept symmetrical. Polyanthas require little pruning. Cut their height by half, and shape; remove dead wood as it appears. Because trimmed canes can be a source for blackspot spores, throw them away immediately after pruning. Water: How much should you use? There isn't a simple answer, but these guidelines will help; Nature can take care of most of the plants native to your region by watering them through rain, dew, and underground sources. Sometimes, however, you may need to help with a sprinkle or two to keep your lawn green and your plants flourishing. Plants need water to survive. Water transports nutrients, which may abound in the soil, from the soil into the roots. Plants maintain proper temperature and rate of growth by transpiring water through the leaves. Plants (vegetables in particular) consist of up to 90 percent water. A loss of water can result in wilting and death. Soil texture is a key factor. Gardeners often ask how often and how much they should water. There isn't a simple answer. Soil texture is a key factor; clay soils can hold three times as much water as sandy soils and will not have to be watered as frequently. Improving your soil allows it to use and conserve water most efficiently, creating the foundation for healthy plants. As a rule of thumb, apply 1 inch of water per watering, and don't water again until the soil surface dries. The time it takes to apply 1 inch of water depends on your method of watering and your water pressure. A simple and inexpensive way to measure your watering is to set up a rain gauge or several empty cans and time how long it takes to collect an inch of water. Drought, weeds, and diseases Light and frequent watering can do more harm than good - it uses more water and encourages shallow root growth, making plants more vulnerable to damage from drought, weeds, and diseases. If only the surface is moist, the roots will concentrate there and derive their nutrients from a very limited area. Deep-rooted plants are better nourished and anchored, and they are better equipped to withstand a drought. There is one time when shallow watering is useful: when seeds are germinating and you want the ground around them to stay moist. If you're planting a new lawn during a dry spell, you may need to water five or six times a day. Spring or fall rains will usually relieve you of frequent watering chores, but you'll need to be ready with the sprinkler if precipitation lags. The system you choose to water your garden depends on the size of your yard, your budget, and the time you want to invest. Watering by hand is time-consuming and inefficient for large areas, but it's often necessary for container plants, seedlings, and hanging baskets. An oscillating or rotating sprinkler will cover large areas, but make certain that the watered areas overlap for even coverage. To avoid dragging the garden hose around the yard, consider installing a sprinkler system. Drip irrigation systems are recommended for flower and food gardens. Water usually travels to plants through tiny holes in a hose on the ground or by small emitters from the hose. Drip irrigation uses less water more efficiently than sprinklers because water is kept closer to the ground instead of sprayed in the air, where much of it is lost to evaporation. Foliage also stays dry, which promotes healthier growth. Temper the wind's force Early morning is the best time to water; less moisture will evaporate in cool temperatures. Avoid watering in the evening to help prevent the risk of fungus diseases. To reduce water lost to evaporation, avoid watering on a windy day. If your garden is exposed, install a hedge or windbreak to temper the wind's force. You can conserve moisture in the soil and reduce the amount of water needed by placing a 2-to 3-inch layer of mulch around plants. A mulch will also keep down competitive weeds. Organic mulches, such as shredded bark, grass clippings, and composted leaves, also enrich the soil as they decompose. You can also use a commercial anti-transpirant spray. Along with reducing water loss from leaves, anti-transpirants greatly reduce transplant shock. There are times, usually in the spring, when too much rain falls for prolonged periods and the soil becomes so saturated that roots die for lack of air. To lessen the damage, plant seeds treated with fungicide so they will be less likely to rot in the ground. Apply additional nitrogen to the soil to spark plant growth and make up for the deficiency from leaching. You can also bore holes around large plants and trees to aerate the soil.

Default,277,"""19930724"",""S are committed to respecting the Geneva Conventions that demand refugee status and asylum for people who have left their home countries out of fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. The drafters of the 1949 refugee conventions had in mind several million Europeans uprooted by World War II. Throughout the years of the Cold War, refugees fleeing ideological oppression were received with open arms. But the 1980s saw an explosion in the world's refugee population. A record 100 million people are now classed as international migrants by the United Nations Population Fund in its report The State of World Population. Of them, 17 million are refugees and another 20 million have fled violence, drought and environmental destruction, the report says. Migration is the visible face of social change, the report said. It is a face often greeted with apprehension. Critics of federal immigration policy are not moved by arguments that there is a limit to what we can afford to do for refugee claimants, says Juneau of the Immigration Department. This year, Canada expects to give refugee status to about 25,000 people who have arrived in this country on their own. In addition to that, another 19,000 are expected to be sponsored from abroad. If Canada were to conclude an agreement with the U. S. A PLANET OF THE INSECTS New studies explain pest success: 'we're resistant to extinction' WASHINGTON - If human beings had any sense of proportion, they would know that Earth is ruled not by two-legged anthropoids or by mammals or even by vertebrates. They would acknowledge what entomologists have long known: this is the planet of the insects. In evolutionary terms, these six-legged creatures are by far the most successful form of animal life known. Scientists have discerned more than 876,000 distinct species. Dozens of new insect species are added to the list every day. For mammals, the figure is closer to one a year. And yet, for all the study, according to two paleobiologists who have just completed a major review of the world's literature on fossil insects, the textbook explanation of why there are so many kinds of bugs is wrong in at least two major respects. First, the researchers report in the July 16 Science, it's not because insects do more evolving than other kinds of life. It's because they are surprisingly resistant to extinction. And second, insect body forms did not suddenly diversify when flowering plants arose 125 million years ago, even though such plants dominate the planet today and are major hosts for insects. Instead, the rate of insect evolution appears to have slowed since then. Moreover, the research challenges the usual view that flowering plants offered new kinds of ecological niches to which insects became adapted. Instead, it might have been the other way around: the plants evolved to take advantage of insect types already in existence. People have had the wrong impression about insect evolution for a long time and mainly for one major reason - they didn't think the fossil record had much to say about insects, said Conrad Labandeira, a specialist in fossil insects at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History who wrote the new report with J. John Sepkoski Jr., a paleontologist at the University of Chicago. WASHINGTON POST WILD The Missouri River, a tributary of the Mississippi, floods a trailer park in St. Charles, Mo. ISABEL WILKERSON NEW YORK TIMES Archeologists unearth ancient piece of linen NEW YORK - Archeologists digging at Çatalhöyük, the site of a prehistoric agricultural village in southern Turkey, have found a small fragment of cloth dating back to 7000 BC. It is the earliest known example of woven fabric and is almost certainly a piece of linen made from domesticated flax. Analysis shows the weave to be an adaptation of even earlier basket-weaving technology. Once people began settling down to farming in the Middle East more than 9,000 years ago, they shed their old hunting clothing of animal skins and learned to make lighter, cooler garments from the fibers of flax. They became the first weavers of textiles, one of the earliest crafts - well before ceramics - associated with the beginnings of agriculture and the rise of human civilization. Robert Braidwood, a University of Chicago archeologist and co-director of the excavation, said it was a rare find because fabrics are seldom preserved in prehistoric ruins. The cloth fragment was in a semi-fossilized state, still clinging to what was probably a tool made of antler. Archeologists are not sure what the material was for. But in the following millennium, figurines would be showing people wearing apparently unisex cloth skirts. NEW YORK TIMES Andromeda has double nucleus, Hubble shows NEW YORK - Astronomers peering deep into the core of the neighboring galaxy Andromeda are seeing double. Where there should be only one nucleus of densely clustered stars, they have detected two, and so are confronted with yet another puzzle over the violent forces that roil the central regions of galaxies. The discovery of the apparent double nucleus in the M31 spiral galaxy in the Andromeda constellation was announced this week by the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. In a detailed examination of new photographs taken by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers identified two bright spots of light at the heart of the galaxy, which is the nearest major aggregation of stars to our own Milky Way. The dimmer of the two spots appears to be at the center of the galaxy. The brighter one is at least five light-years away from the true center, but it corresponds to what astronomers had previously thought was the galactic nucleus, based on observations from the ground. It is not the first time a double nucleus has been found at the center of a galaxy, but astronomers said its occurrence in the Andromeda galaxy was particularly surprising and hard to explain. The few double-nucleus galaxies that have been discovered in recent years are generally attributed to the merger of two galaxies. Andromeda had appeared to be a single, relatively undisturbed spiral galaxy. """"Hubble shows that the M31 nucleus is much more complex than previously thought,"""" said Tod Lauer of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories in Tucson, Ariz. He and Sandra Faber of the University of California at Santa Cruz directed the photographic analysis that led to the discovery. Lauer and Faber suggested two possible interpretations of the Andromeda findings. One is that the brighter object might be the remnant of a smaller galaxy cannibalized by Andromeda. The other possibility is that dust might be dimming the core to create the illusion of a pair of star clusters when, in fact, they are two segments of a single elongated nucleus. NEW YORK TIMES CHICAGO - No one alive has seen the Father of Rivers yawn this high or this wide. No one imagined the Mississippi or its relatives would take such liberties, consuming so many hamlets whole, or that, if they did, technology would be nearly helpless to stop them. There have been floods before. People in Hannibal, Mo., or Keokuk, Iowa, or Quincy, Ill., can tell you about watching their fathers and uncles pack sandbags to protect the year's corn crop or the feed store. For generations, some farmers figured floods and droughts into the cost of doing business. But then the country's big plumbing system of levees and dams, made better after every flood, was supposed to keep the rivers in their place and maintain the comfortable paradox of living on a floodplain. Now the unimaginable has happened. Across the Midwestern corn belt it has rained in biblical proportions - more than 40 straight days, often in torrents. The rivers, driven past their banks, have taken back land that long ago was theirs, invading more than 15 million acres of farmland in eight states, forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes, halting river traffic for 600 miles and causing billions of dollars in damage. From the air, from Minnesota to Missouri, from Kansas to Illinois, it looks like someone has spilled gallons and gallons of coffee on a green patchwork quilt that happens to be farms and towns. In silt rivers now wide as lakes, treetops look like bushes in a swimming pool, bridges and highways and other brave monuments to engineering are reduced to thin, threatened slivers, and even their builders know the water could take them, too, if it wanted. The floods have made the broad, S-curved Mississippi and its otherwise perfectly ordered valley look more like the Florida Keys. Unlike earthquakes and hurricanes, floods defy the human urge to quantify. There is no single measure - no Richter scale, or mph wind as in the eye of a hurricane - to gauge a flood. There are only the hundreds of crests and toppled levees on the rivers and their swollen creeks, and the thousand heartbreaks of lost soybean fields and moated Main Streets. If the floods of 1993 have reminded people of anything, it is that the Mississippi River was never the docile pensioner some had come to think it was. It is not, after all, the Swanee. The Mississippi is America's watery aorta, draining or potentially flooding rivers in 31 states from the Appalachians to the Rocky Mountains. """"It's like talking about God Almighty himself,"""" said Shelby Foote, the Memphis writer who has lived his whole life on the river. The river, ecologists and farmers say, was never supposed to follow the tight course humans have expected it to, indeed ordered it to, with their walls of dirt and concrete levees. Of course, that has not stopped people from building homes and farms and cities along the river. The Mississippi Valley's thick black soil is considered the richest on Earth, impossible for farmers to resist. But to claim the land meant making a bargain with the river, confining it to an artificially narrow path so that farms could reach as far as the shore and places like New Orleans and St. Louis could live undisturbed while their goods were carried safely from port to port. The price that river people pay is sudden and catastrophic flooding when excess rainwater, forced into a narrow channel by the levees, runs out of places to go and cannot drain naturally into the soil. Then the river goes faster and faster, and it goes where it wishes, as it did during the flooding of the lower Mississippi in 1927, where, as William Faulkner wrote, the river """"was now doing what it liked to do, had waited patiently the 10 years in order to do, as a mule will work for you 10 years for nothing."""" The forces of nature are responsible for both the cause and cure of the flooding that has devastated the Midwest. Experts say the rainy season that caused the floods may not be over yet. Once the rain subsides, the flooding will take at least three to four weeks to be absorbed into the earth and back into the Mississippi and other rivers. The water will dissipate in several ways. Rain that falls in the Mississippi's drainage basin is fed into the river through its 250 tributaries. The basin covers about 3 million square kilometers. Some water will return to the water cycle through evaporation. Levees are earthen banks that are built to keep out floodwaters. The levees have given way, allowing the floodwaters to inundate towns and farmland. Most of the water will flow directly into the Mississippi. Other water will filter down to the water table and flow into the river. Subsurface drainage systems will return water trapped on farmland on the other side of intact levees back to the river through underground tile pipes. Excess moisture that seeps through the cracks in the pipes is carried away from the farmland to ponds, rivers or drainage ditches. The unimaginable has happened. After rains of biblical proportions, the Mississippi has triumphed over man - and the tight course it was never meant to follow. Foote was a boy during that flood. He remembers when word came that the levee had broken at Mounds Landing in Scott, Miss., north of Greenville. """"It was a slow creeping rise,"""" he said. """"You can't even see it rise but if you turn away and then you look back, you see it is a little higher. Everything in its path is submerged or invaded. It presses against every crack and crevice. It's like solid wind when it comes."""" BECAUSE of its might and wilfulness, some ecologists argue that the very way people define a river is not particularly useful. They say that the river is not just whatever water you see in the channel, but the banks, the floodplain, in fact, the valley itself, from bluff to bluff. It is anywhere the water has been and could potentially go - a river, Mark Twain said, """"whose alluvial banks cave and change constantly, whose snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose sand bars are never at rest."""" In earlier centuries, when towns in the bottomlands were invaded by river water, townspeople packed up and moved to higher ground - as Franklin, Mo., for example, on the Missouri River, did in 1826. (Even that move could not save Franklin from the flooding of 1993, however, the town is underwater again.) Now, more than 7 million people live directly along the Mississippi, including more than 2 million around its confluence with the Missouri in St. Louis. """"No one is going to move St. Louis just because it happens to be in the river,"""" said David Johnson, an aquatic ecologist who is assistant director of the School of Natural Resources at Ohio State University. """"It's a question of working with the river or fighting the river. Fighting the river is almost always going to be a losing battle."""" He argues for restoring the kind of wide open spaces that the river once had before Europeans and the great cities came, wetlands where the water could collect in times of severe rains. The Army Corps of Engineers already has built some reservoirs to catch the runoff, although the current flooding suggests they might not be enough. In defense of the complex and normally efficient flood-control system, hydraulic engineers say that without the man-made reservoirs, the bloated river would now stretch from bluff to bluff, five miles across in spots, covering what we now know as Dubuque, Iowa, or St. Louis. """"People think of the river as their enemy,"""" said David Lanegran, a professor of geography and urban studies at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn. """"They fight the river, dike the river, pollute the river, ignore the river. Now the river is taking back its old places. You can see the old marshes coming back in the farmers' fields, all the places where the duck ponds used to be. It's almost like a ghost. The water is saying, 'This is where I used to be. This used to be my place.' If there is an economic beneficiary of this flood, it is the farm states of the eastern Midwest - Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, where farmers will get to take advantage of the run-up in crop prices due to the low supply. """"That will make the flood even more painful for farmers in the floodplains,"""" said William Heffernan, a professor and chairman of rural sociology at the University of Missouri in Columbia. """"They will be watching the highest prices in years and, they don't have anything to sell."""" As disastrous as a flood is to those in its path, it is nonetheless part of a natural cycle of renewal just as forest fires are. The river channels grow so wide and the currents so strong they lift topsoil, carry nutrients downstream and deposit them in new soil. Iowa's loss might be Missouri's gain, but then Iowa might get its own refill from Minnesota. The heavy rains that precede the flooding can also cleanse the waters and make a better pool for fish to spawn. The current crisis will undoubtedly set off wide debate over ways to improve the system with an eye not to just one city or river but to the 250 or so creeks and rivers that feed into the Mississippi. Only fairly recently in the river's history, when Congress authorized a federal levee project after the 1927 flood, has there been any systematic approach to flood control. But that was based in part on bringing up to code the haphazard levees of assorted farm towns which in times of desperation built wherever they felt like it. New and better levees have gone up, but they, too, can fail. """"People expect more out of what was there than was ever intended,"""" said Harry Kitch, chief of the central-planning management branch of the Army Corps of Engineers. THE GREAT LESSON of the floods may be that humans will have to do a lot more if they are to outwit nature, if that is even possible. """"I think we as moderns tend to think that geological and meteorological changes have stopped,"""" said Bruce Michaelson, a professor of English at the University of Illinois at Urbana, who is writing a book about Mark Twain, """"that volcanoes will no longer erupt, that hurricanes will no longer come off the coasts and the great rivers of the world are going to stay quietly in their banks so we can cruise them in our boats and barges."""" But just as the river that Mark Twain romanced and revered carried the pieces of wrecked houses and trees from floods upstream, so it does a century later - """"the debris,"""" Michaelson said, """"of battlefields between water and man.""""

Default,278,"A 6 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JULY 26, 1996 We'll look at water management policies Cliche says ELIZABETH THOMPSON GAZETTE QUEBEC BUREAU QUEBEC - The provincial Environment Department will re-evaluate its water management policies in the wake of last weekend's disastrous flooding in the Saguenay-Lac St-Jean region, Environment Minister David Cliche said yesterday. """"It is now known that the planet is warming up and it is more and more probable that with the warming of the planet this kind of event, that is to say floods and droughts, are phenomena that we will have to learn to live with."""" This will perhaps allow us to rethink certain things. Cliche said he also will look at whether to force privately owned dams across Quebec to undergo periodic government inspections and whether the province should prohibit some Saguenay-Lac St-Jean residents from rebuilding too close to the waterways that flooded. Serious questions However, none of that would have claimed the lives of 10 people across eastern Quebec, including three children, Cliche said. """"When a catastrophe happens like this, when a disaster comes, after the shock people try to find somebody who is responsible for it,"""" he said. """"What I am saying today is we have done our best. We have minimized the impact. If we had not been there, it would have been worse."""" Cliche's comments come amid serious questions on the part of many Saguenay-Lac St-Jean residents who suspect Quebec's system of managing its dams and the water level in Lac Kenogami was partly to blame for the extent of the devastation. They charge the water level was kept too high prior to the rainstorm and officials were too slow to open the floodgates to relieve some of the pressure. Yesterday, armed with charts, graphs, maps and accompanied by civil servants, Cliche said Environment Department officials began opening the floodgates of the dams on Lac Kenogami wider last Wednesday once they received forecasts of heavy rains for the region. Although some have suggested Quebec should have emptied the lake, Cliche said it would have been impossible to empty the reservoir in less than 15 days. Fifteen days beforehand, nobody could predict that level of rainfall that in some places reached 280 mm over three days - the kind of thing you see once in 10,000 years, he said. Nor would it have prevented the disaster, because the rainfall was 1.5 times the total capacity of the reservoir, he said. """"Even if the reservoir had been completely empty we would have had the same disaster."""" Saved lives In fact the presence of the dams and the way the government handled them probably saved many lives, Cliche added. By not fully opening the floodgates immediately, they were able to reduce the maximum flow by 28 per cent and buy public security officials 21 hours to evacuate dwellings. However, Cliche also admitted that his department's management of the crisis was not without its problems. Yvon Gosselin, the Environment Department official in charge of the dams, said there was a mechanical breakdown of the upper spillway at the Portage des Roches dam as a result of the force of the water. At the Pibrac dams there was a short circuit when floodwaters reached the electrical system and prevented workers from opening the dam fully. Cliche also was faced with questions about the management of a dam owned by Stone Consolidated at the mouth of Lac Ha! Ha! During the downpour, water from the lake crushed one of the earthen dikes and destroyed houses in its path as it flooded into La Baie. Cliche said that while private dams have to be approved by the government when they are built, their maintenance and operation are totally in the hands of their owners. However, Cliche said, among the questions he plans to study is whether the government should begin inspecting private dams. While he rejected calls for a public inquiry, Cliche said he wants a review of Quebec's water management practices and to accelerate work on a province-wide water management policy. """"It has become apparent,"""" he said, """"that we should adopt a water policy. We are the Arabs of water."""" Quebec has 10 per cent of the world's fresh water reserves. Cliche said he also wants to re-evaluate the traditional boundaries of the waterways in the areas affected by the flooding and probably prevent some residents and businesses from rebuilding in the same spots. CP Homeless: Hugue Re Simard lived just behind the Jonquiere apartment block teetering on the river bank. Flood payout whets appetites Victims of earlier disasters yearn for more JONATHON GATEHOUSE THE GAZETTE The generous response of the federal and provincial governments to last weekend's devastating Quebec floods has raised questions of fairness and hopes for increased compensation among victims of previous natural disasters. """"It's not setting a legal precedent, but it's certainly setting a social and moral one,"""" Montreal lawyer Irwin Liebman said yesterday. In 1987, Liebman launched a class action seeking increased financial compensation for thousands of area residents whose homes were flooded after a summer storm dumped 102 millimetres of rain in less than an hour. The rainwater caused hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage across the city, but most Montrealers didn't qualify for assistance. The court challenge was dismissed in 1988. """"The current victims (in the Saguenay-Lac St-Jean region) deserve every penny, and I hope they get their compensation, but Montrealers were really done in,"""" Liebman said. On Wednesday, Premier Lucien Bouchard announced a special financial aid package for individuals and municipalities damaged by overflowing rivers in the Saguenay-Lac St-Jean and along the North Shore. The new plan more than doubles the previous maximum payout per household. Flood victims who have lost their homes will receive 100 per cent reimbursement of the first $100,000 of their property's assessed value and 75 per cent of the remaining value. The government also will pay up to an additional $15,000 to owners for the loss of furniture and personal effects and a further $1,000 for each other occupant. Municipalities will be reimbursed for 100 per cent of their emergency expenses and 90 per cent of the reconstruction costs of damaged municipal infrastructure. It is estimated that the new relief package will cost a minimum of $200 million, with the federal government picking up between 50 and 90 per cent of the tab. Under the province's existing emergency relief plan, offering compensation for natural disasters like last winter's floods in Chateauguay, victims are eligible for up to 70 per cent of the value of damaged buildings and essential goods, such as clothes and major appliances. There is no compensation for land and the maximum payout per residence is $50,000, with a $500 deductible. Municipalities ravaged by acts of God are reimbursed through a complicated sliding percentage formula based on the per capita cost of repairs. In an interview yesterday, Chateauguay Mayor Jean-Bosco Bourcier said he welcomes the more generous compensation rules and plans to press the government to apply them to outstanding damage claims in his city. More than 30 homes in the municipality were destroyed and 717 were damaged when the Chateauguay River overflowed Jan. 19. The flooding caused an estimated $2.5 million in property damage and the city of Chateauguay incurred more than $600,000 in emergency and cleanup costs. Bourcier said the city stands to recover only 50 per cent of its costs under the existing regulations. But he said it would be inappropriate to press the issue so soon after last weekend's disaster and he will wait until the end of summer before approaching the province. Marc Lavallee of the civil protection branch of Quebec's Public Security Department, which administers disaster relief, said the new flood compensation plan is a special reaction to an extraordinary disaster. He said the generosity of the package is greater than usual because of the increased participation of the federal government. Lavallee said he was unable to predict whether the new guidelines would be applied to claims arising from previous disasters. But he did note that government relief packages have become progressively more generous in recent years. """"For us this is a surprise,"""" he said. """"It's a whole new game. But what's going to happen next? I can't say."""" """"Nothing will ever replace what I've lost."""" CONTINUED FROM PAGE At Sept-Iles for a couple and their 18-month-old daughter who drowned when their car plunged into a washout on the North Shore. The $450 million repair bill includes the costs of rebuilding infrastructure like water mains and sidewalks, building new houses and repairing damaged ones, compensating flood victims for furniture and personal effects and providing financial assistance to small businesses. John Burke, a civil protection officer, predicted it could take up to two years to rebuild all the roads, bridges and shorelines in the devastated region. Premier Lucien Bouchard announced a $200 million compensation fund on Monday and has since come up with a more generous relief program. Flood victims who have lost their homes will be reimbursed 100 per cent of the first $100,000 of the municipal assessment value of their homes and 75 per cent of any amount in excess of that. The compensation program announced by the premier relies on Ottawa to pick up most of the tab under a disaster relief agreement. The Quebec government has pledged that evaluators will visit each home within days and residents will receive a cheque covering 50 per cent of the assessed damage almost immediately. More than 800 people have received advance cheques of $2,500 to take care of immediate needs. Among them was Monette Levesque, whose house in La Baie and the land underneath it were swept away. Levesque probably will be eligible for $90,000 in aid covering the full municipal evaluation of her property and her furniture. But Levesque, 59, was still in despair over the loss of the house she had lived in for 35 years, and the neighborhood that surrounded it. """"I cry every morning when I get dressed,"""" she said outside the town hall. """"Nothing will ever replace what I've lost."""" About 350 houses were destroyed, mostly in La Baie, Laterriere, Jonquiere and Chicoutimi. Another 200 buildings that remain standing will have to be condemned as unstable, Burke said. About 5,000 people are expected to return home today, bringing the total number to 9,000. But 2,000 are still homeless and might have to wait months before they can move into permanent dwellings. Construction crews continued working double shifts to repair bridges and roads in La Baie, the hardest-hit community. Long lines of heavy trucks rumbled into the town loaded with tons of granite and earth. Major industries such as Alcan have suffered tens of millions of dollars worth of damage. Last night, the aluminum company finished reconstructing a bank of the Riviere a Mars that supports a vital bridge. """"That project usually takes weeks to be completed and we did it in four days,"""" Alcan engineer Christine Tremblay said. Local tourist officials appealed to Canadians yesterday not to forsake the region - normally a popular vacation spot renowned for its fjords. The tourist industry has lost millions of dollars each day since record rainfalls last Friday. Public Security Minister Robert Perreault, who visited the region in the morning, said the government will reimburse municipalities for 90 per cent of the cost of repairs to infrastructure. """"The mayors have told us they are extremely happy with the swift response of the government and the support they have received,"""" Perreault told reporters when told that the mayors of some villages had complained. Authorities have not yet calculated the cost of rebuilding parts of the North Shore and Charlevoix regions, which also were battered by floods. But Jean Morneau, a senior civil protection official, said those regions suffered damage on about one-tenth the scale of the Saguenay-Lac St-Jean.

Default,279,"A2 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1990 There are times I'd do anything for 40 winks, or even 20. Good morning. Many of you probably spent last flight doing something boring, like sleeping. Not me! I was too busy. I read books, I planned the guest list for my 1991 Halloween party; I counted odd numbers backward starting from 10,000. I was trying to sleep, fighting off a bout of occasional insomnia I've suffered ever since I was old enough to climb out of a crib. I don't sleep when I'm too unhappy, or when I'm too happy. I don't sleep when I eat too late at night, or when I eat too early. In truth, I haven't slept like a baby since I was one. I have always envied you people who sleep well. You sleep lying down, sitting at your desk and standing in the bus. You sleep through fires, floods, earthquakes and bankruptcy. I don't know how I do it, you say, with a sleepy smile. I just close my eyes and Zzzzzz I'm asleep. In fact, I'm having a hard time staying awake right now. Fortunately, I'm not a full-time insomniac, one of those people with bags under their eyes deep enough to pack luggage in. I just stay up part-time, several times a month. I'll sleep like a log for 4½ hours, then wake up with my mind in high gear, eager to worry about everything from Gorbachev's wheat shortage to the fact I forgot to floss. Unfortunately, the middle of the night is the worst time for me to worry. Routine chores seem like Herculean tasks: picking a wedding present for someone is a life-and-death choice. An unpaid telephone bill of $17.56 seems certain to lead to Bordeaux jail. At 4 a.m., I'm sure it will destroy my credit rating, cause Visa to cancel my card and the bank to repossess my house. I'll be homeless and searching the gutter for orange rinds. And then there's that unpaid parking ticket! Oh, God! I could get the chair! Once my mind starts buzzing I am like the princess who couldn't sleep because there was a pea under her mattress. My blanket seems too thick and my blinds too thin, my sheet too prickly and my mattress too stiff. And why is the fridge humming so loud? I wrestle with the blankets until they're a hopeless mess, and everything seems to conspire against my sleep. As Gilbert and Sullivan once wrote in a song about insomnia: The bedding all creeps to the ground in a heap and I pick it all up in a tangle. Then my pillow resigns and politely declines to recline at the usual angle. I know I could always just give up and get up. Edison, Churchill and Napoleon rarely slept more than four hours and it didn't do them much harm. But I wonder whether they looked like me at the breakfast table, so sluggish I can't get cereal into my mouth without hitting my cheek. No, as any insomniac knows, the key is to stay in bed, STOP THINKING and go back to sleep. But how? I've tried buying sleep tapes with hypnotic voices ordering me to RELAX! I've listened to New Age soundscapes of waves, waterfalls and animals going: Chicicicicicica-oooooo, Chicachicacacaca-ooooo ooooo oooooo. It's like the stuff they play to relax you on Air Canada flights these days. I call it Radio Whippoorwill. Many insomniacs have their own tricks. Some sing tedious songs like 100 bottles of beer on the wall until they bore themselves to sleep; others repeat mantras like I am what I am what I am what I am. One person I know falls asleep by imagining he is falling downward, forever, in a variety of ways. He falls out of planes, buildings, cable cars and double-decker buses; down cliffs, elevators, mine shafts and wells. Sounds like a nightmare to me, a sure-fire way to stay up. In the early '70s, I lived in a student co-op on what is now Dr. Penfield Ave, with 10 other people, ranging from a European ambassador's daughter to a male psychiatric intern who wore a skirt. The only thing we all had in common was insomnia. Every night at 4:30 a.m., we would gather in the kitchen for an informal insomnia clinic. We read aloud long poems like T.C. Frontenac.

Here are three reasons why you should be there: First, not even the overtly messianic U2-ishness of Lace Virginia, the droning rhythm of All I Am, or the positively Bono-like impressionism of these lyrics can obscure the band's self-assuredness. Second, there's an earthiness grounding all the guitar atmospherics. Finally, An Emotional Fish has a sound and a presence that imply Sunday night's show ($8) could be one of the year's turning points. TOMMY CONWELL AND THE YOUNG RUMBLERS Guitar Trouble Columbia CBS If there is something authentic about the cut of Tommy Conwell's Levis, there's something manufactured as well.

One example of how Canada is supporting rainforest depredation is through the annual purchase of $10 million in hardwoods from East Malaysia, where seven square kilometres of tropical rainforests are destroyed daily, the highest rate of logging in the world, according to the Malaysian chapter of Friends of the Earth, an international environmental watchdog. But the Canadian role in rainforest destruction is not being played out solely by consumers. An official with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) whose mandate includes supporting ecologically sustainable development admits Canadian funds are contributing to forestry practices in the state of Sarawak in East Malaysia. Ralph Roberts, CIDA's Forestry Sector Chief, says funds for developmental assistance to East Malaysia, intended for forestry management, are channeled in an indirect way through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which approves funds for projects initiated by member nations. Richard Baerg, a forester with CIDA, notes that ASEAN methods of forestry management are increasing the depredation of rain forests. Indeed, many tropical countries have provoked timber booms by assigning harvesting rights to concessionaires for royalty, rent and tax payments, according to 1987's Our Common Future: the World Commission on Environment and Development, chaired by Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. Efforts to provide assistance in finding methods of management to make rainforests renewable resources are futile, Forsyth contends. No one knows the most beneficial way to manage tropical forests. No one invests in management and future. Every tree has to be cut as fast as possible. Indonesia, at present, has a $2-billion wood export and would like to see it increase to $10 billion by the middle of the decade. The International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), formed in 1978 under the auspices of the United Nations, is responsible for regulating tropical timber trade between producing and consuming nations as well as finding ways to conserve and develop the tropical forests. Canada is one of the organization's 43 members. Environmentalists such as Peggy Hallward, director of forestry research for Toronto-based Probe International, have criticized the organization for its failure to take steps in halting the pillaging of the forests. They are not concerned with forest protection, Hallward said. They are concerned with maximizing timber output. They could protect the primary forests and try to reforest already degraded land, in Sarawak, for example, but they aren't doing that. Dave Boulter, one of Canada's two delegates to the ITTO, says the organization does not see rainforest management as an imperative, despite ITTO findings that less than 0.125 per cent of all tropical forestry is managed on a sustainable basis and that the tropical timber trade is directly responsible for 25 per cent of tropical deforestation. Canada has no overall policy on the importation of rainforest woods, and officials with the Department of External Affairs say a policy is not forthcoming. Canada imports over $40 million in rainforest wood annually from Indonesia, its main source of rainforest wood. But it's not necessary to import these types of woods, said Forsyth. If consumers want a hardwood floor, we have oak. If people want to buy a dining room set, we have maple. Instead of using tropical plywood, we can buy plywood made from coniferous trees which are native to Canada. What may be luring shoppers to buy wood products originating from rainforests where workers are paid less than one dollar an hour is their affordability on the North American market. The effects of forest depredation are numerous and colossal: rainforest depletion has been linked to the greenhouse effect (the warming of the earth's surface and lower atmosphere which intensifies with an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide), erosion of land where forests once stood which leads to massive flooding, and the displacement of native gatherers and hunters who use the forests without contributing to their destruction. In 1988, Friends of the Earth published a 200-page book listing names and addresses of businesses selling rainforest products that originate from countries contributing to deforestation and those that do not. Titled the Good Wood Guide, the handbook was distributed to businesses and environmental groups throughout Great Britain, which then was a major consumer of rainforest woods. The effect of the publication was astounding: consumers boycotted companies which carried products from culprit countries, forcing the businesses to find alternative products to attract environmentally-conscious shoppers. Forsyth says Canadians can take a stand to halt the destruction of the rainforests by pressing the federal government to implement stricter quotas to limit the importation of rainforest wood and by purchasing non-tropical wood products. Canadians can ask for legislation to invest our money to better ends and write to their MPs, he said. Why don't Canadian consumers buy pine, oak, or cherry? Then they can be assured it didn't come from the rainforests. Prairie farmers struggle to survive against all odds VANCOUVER Springwater is a tiny cluster of houses in Saskatchewan an hour and a half drive northeast of Saskatoon. Springwater is a symbol of what's happening throughout this farming province; it is becoming deserted. The few remaining inhabitants around this ghost town cling to a value system that seems anachronistic but really informs us of the enormous changes that we have undergone in urban Canada. I recently met with a few families of the Springwater area. They were third and fourth-generation Saskatchewan farmers determined to stay on the land. Within minutes, they were telling me of the town's demise from high interest and low market prices. The people who remain have to drive more than 32 kilometres to shop at Biggar, their children spend hours in school buses and young people often must leave to find jobs in a big city. In its glory days, Springwater was a bustling hub for farmers in the area and boasted its own bakery, butcher shop, hotel, restaurants, school, pharmacy and hardware store. The town of some 200 people once had police, firefighters and a doctor. Five grain elevators beside the railway dominated the prairie skyline. On weekends, Springwater was crowded with people drawn from the surrounding region to put their cattle and hogs for market in the railway stockyards. Families came to shop, visit at the cafe or go to a movie. Life was simpler but no less meaningful a generation or two ago. Today, the grain elevators are gone and all that's left of the railway is the trackbed. Boarded-up houses and buildings crumble to dust, two rusting gas pumps guard the main street and only three families remain. And yet people hang on against all economic common sense. The reason why they stay was obvious after a woman told me about a freak accident that recently killed her husband when his drilling rig hit an electrical wire. 2 3 S 4 bedroom condominium from $79,900 - Ct! 2535 Mcxijgra VfcSHjural 956-7840 1 btx south of Thimens just east of Cavendish, corner Samscr' Sales office open 1-6 PM Mon-Thurs: 12-6 PM Sat & Sun! mortgage rate guaranteed at 1.89%!

European sizzler notches 46th death as Bucharest swelters at 45C ANCA TEODORESCU AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE Bucharest - The death toll from a searing heat wave across southern Europe reached at least 46 yesterday, while in Britain torrential rain that claimed three lives has forced hundreds to flee a creaking dam. Twenty-nine heat-related deaths were recorded in Romania, where temperatures yesterday hit 45 degrees Celsius. Four people have died in Greece, six in Italy, three in Albania and at least four in Bosnia, Croatia and Turkey. Three elderly people died in the Italian island of Sicily yesterday, taking the nationwide toll in the current heat wave to six. Two men, both over 80, died in the southern town of Calabria, while a 59-year-old woman was found dead in her home in Palermo. Italian firefighters have dropped tanks of water from aircraft to control more than 30 forest fires after temperatures in the south topped 45C. Bucharest was Europe's hottest capital yesterday with temperatures at 45C and a heat alert was sounded for much of the south of the country. Ambulance services were besieged with calls to help people fainting in the street, officials said. Fourteen people have died from the heat in the city over the past week, according to authorities, who have set up more than 30 first aid tents in Bucharest alone to cope with the casualties. Police have been handing out water in the street and the health ministry has warned the elderly and those with debilitating illnesses not to go out during the day. Temperatures hit 44C in Athens and central Greece, the hottest day this year, and the government urged the public to save power as electricity consumption hit new highs. The Greek military has suspended all exercises and public services were closed in the afternoon. Temperatures in Bulgaria beat the record for a second time this week with the mercury shooting up to 43C yesterday in the southeastern town of Radnevo. Authorities sprayed water on the tram rails to prevent them from buckling in the heat but no casualties have been reported. Trains ran at lower speeds, in some cases at 30 kilometres per hour as rails were buckling in the heat. Police also banned heavy trucks from the roads at the hottest hours. Authorities in seven Turkish provinces have given two or three days of leave to handicapped or pregnant civil servants, Anatolia news agency said. Northern Africa was also affected by the heat wave with temperatures of over 40C recorded in Tunisia, where several fires were fanned by the heat and strong Sirocco winds. There were power cuts across the country, notably in the seaside capital Tunis. Northern Europe meanwhile was drenched by torrential downpours. Three people have died in floods in England and hundreds have been evacuated from their homes because the rains threatened to cause a dam to burst. A bridge collapsed in western England. Authorities in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, told people living near Ulley Dam to leave their homes after receiving a warning the walls could collapse. A section of the nearby main M1 highway was also closed. In nearby Sheffield, Royal Air Force helicopters airlifted people in flooded areas to safety. A 14-year-old boy was swept to his death in a swollen river and a 68-year-old man was killed as he crossed a flooded road. In Hull, on the east coast, a man drowned after becoming trapped up to his neck in a drain on a flooded street. Pakistan's southern coast was lashed by a powerful cyclone yesterday, killing at least 18 people, leaving dozens more missing and forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes, officials said. Cyclone Yemyin made landfall over the southwestern province of Baluchistan with winds of up to 130 kilometres an hour. At least two Pakistani fishing boats were reported to have sunk in the Arabian Sea and several more were missing with their crews, sparking a desperate search by navy and coast guard helicopters and ships. Yemyin barrelled in three days after another violent storm killed at least 235 people in the southern port city of Karachi and sparsely populated Baluchistan. Forecasters said a 7.6-metre storm surge was feared. A 56-year-old woman and her 14-year-old grandson also died when they sought shelter under a corrugated iron roof, while two residents of Nanchang city were killed while they huddled under a tree, also on Sunday. In nearby Zhejiang province, five people building a tomb on a small hill were killed in a lightning storm on Monday, Xinhua added. China's extreme weather has killed at least 155 people in flooding this year, while about 2 million people were suffering from drought in the north, the government said.

Many felt June was chillier than usual with 217.6 hours of sunshine, but in fact the weather was in the normal range. The average high for the month of 229 hours was 23C. The mean temperature of 18.5C was in line with the average normal for June in this city. The hottest day was June 13, when temperatures hit 30C.

In the swelter of mid-afternoon, it is full of divers, paddlers and folks just hanging on to the side, soaking up the chlorine. A trifle too crowded? Perhaps you would prefer a backyard pool of your own. This ultimate luxury will cost you between $3,300 and $5,000 for an above-ground pool and between $12,000 and $22,000 for a sunken variety.

Ron and Susan Wener seek and find Home Is Where the Heat Ain't. No residence is impenetrable to heat. Even if you close all the curtains and windows during the day and open them at night, your home may still need to be cooled artificially. Hardware and department stores understand this and consequently arrange displays of electric fans to cool you as you enter the store. They range from tiny desktop fans for $13 to swiveling multi-speed industrial strength blowers for $50. All types are effective to a degree but tend to be refreshing only when you stand in the direct path of air. Fans don't cool rooms; they simply circulate the air already present. An air-conditioner is a more effective but at around $500 a more expensive solution. The better alternative is to rent one from an outlet like Mid-City Rentals and Sales which will install it at the seasonal rate of $139. Of course, even an air conditioner can do only so much. If you put an air conditioner in your living room,"""" said Stan Schneider, owner of Mid-City, """"you can't expect the cool air to go down the hall, turn left into the bedroom and then right into the kitchen. But it can help lower the humidity in the house. A word of warning: if you install an air conditioner in a window, do not open that particular window. Schneider tells of one person who did this and sent the unit plummeting downwards, creating an instant sunroof in a neighbor's Mercedes. Nice Ice is cheap, easy to make and very satisfying. Here's what to do: take a tray of ice cubes, dump it into a washcloth and make a cold compress. Press it against your neck and let the melting ice trickle out of the cloth down your back. Roll ice cubes around in your hands. Cool off your mouth with one or two. Use your imagination. Think about the film 9 Weeks. Party-poopers who prefer their ice a little less wet can purchase icepacks for as little as $2.50. Popsicles are mostly sugar and water but they are still as good as when you were a kid and cost only 15 cents at Perrette's and Provi-soir. Eat, Drink and Be Cool. Here's some advice on cooking during a heatwave: Don't do it! Even boiling an egg can give a whole new meaning to the phrase """"Hell's Kitchen."""" Stick to light, cool meals, advises dietician and nutritionist Claire Friefeld. """"Refueling and keeping energy levels up are important considerations in the summer,"""" she said. """"In terms of food, the cooler foods such as fish, legumes, breads, crackers and yogurts are rich in carbohydrates for providing energy."""" As for drinks, Friefeld recommends wonderful, cold water and 100 per cent unsweetened fruit juices. She does not give thirst quenchers like Gatorade much credit. """"When you sweat, you lose potassium and sodium. Gatorade drinks aren't as high in potassium as food in the four food groups. A better choice would be orange juice or tomato juice."""" If you think a trough full of suds will cool you down, think again. While it may be immediately refreshing, beer, like tea and coffee, is a diuretic and actually steals water from your body. """"You should actually drink water while you're drinking beer,"""" Friefeld said. The Zen of Cool. You can manipulate your body temperature. You can splash water on it, throw air at it, pour fluids into it but perhaps, in the end, keeping cool is as much a state of mind as a state of body. In a convertible, one finds this essence of """"cool."""" """"I really feel good putting the top down, turning up the radio, even when I'm stuck in traffic,"""" said Ron Wener, a chartered accountant in his mid-40s. He has driven nothing but convertibles ever since he was a kid and once owned a 1973 Ford Mustang convertible, one of the last of the original-style ragtops. These days he drives a cream Dodge 600. """"It's not the snazziest car in the world but it is a convertible and that counts for a lot in the world of keeping cool."""" """"I enjoy letting the wind go through my hair,"""" the rather balding Wener said with an ironic grin. """"It's not for everyone,"""" he cautioned. """"My wife likes it in the city but on the highway she's not comfortable with the top down."""" Whether or not driving roofless is an effective heat-buster is practically irrelevant. A convertible echoes with Beach Boy fantasies and Jan and Dean dreams. It cries out smugly, """"I am just too cool to be hot."""" City Heat. You walk out of the artificial underground coolness of Promenades de la Cathedrale and run smack into a wall of exhaust-tinted heat. Immediately you are dripping with perspiration. """"It's hot. Hotter than a judge's tongue at a chili-tasting contest. Hotter than Satan's sneakers."""" As you walk down St. Catherine St., you pray for rain, for snow, for a magic carpet, anything to get you out of this crushing, sticky heat. """"Hey, man, can you spare some change?"""" asks a grizzled hippie bum with a dog. You check your pockets. """"Sure is hot, eh?"""" he says. """"Hey, do you know if the fountain is working at Place Ville Marie?"""" Hmmmmmmm. Now there's an idea! Bad mowing: can cut down on lawn's performance. Mowing, watering and feeding count most when it comes to lawn management, and good mowing practices can cut down on water usage. Proper mowing will help your lawn get through the heat of summer in shape to develop strong, new roots and growth this fall. Frequency and height of mowing vary by the season and condition of your lawn. At summer's hottest, though, mowing high, 2.5 to 3 inches, is best, as it leaves grass blades enough surface area to store extra food. Mowing benefits more than a lawn's appearance. As grass blades age they become coarse and spotted from disease and insect damage. Different grass plants also grow at different rates, so lawns soon become uneven in height. Mowing removes old, damaged growth and stimulates new growth of clean, green blades. It also evens out blade height to produce the carpet-like appearance. Grass plants cut too short won't root deeply, but if you have a thick turf and let the grass get too high, it will appear yellowish after cutting. This is because light can't reach the lower part of the blades, and the green (chlorophyll) inside the grass stays pale. The condition of your grass at mowing time also is important. While you obviously wouldn't mow when the grass is sopping wet, neither should you mow when it is too dry. Wilted or dry grass can be damaged by the mower's weight, showing up later as streak lines in the lawn. Apply fertilizers, weed killers and lawn insect controls after mowing. Many times, the apparent failure of these products is not in how you applied them, but the fact that the next day or so you mowed off the dandelions or clover plants just absorbing the chemical controls. Finally, dull mowers, or those out of adjustment, can lead you to believe your grass suffers from all kinds of ailments. Dull rotary mowers whip off the grass rather than cut it, thus the torn tops of the blades turn brown. Reel mowers not doing the job well will pinch the grass blades in several places rather than cut them off. These damaged blades will also turn brown.

Uri Savir, director-general of Israel's foreign ministry, and his Jordanian counterpart, Nayef al-Hadid, agreed in talks in Amman that both countries would announce the establishment of diplomatic ties in a joint communique, paving the way for opening embassies and exchanging ambassadors by Dec 10 - a target date set in their treaty ending a 46-year state of war. Jordan is only the second Arab state, after Egypt, formally at peace with Israel. It will open an embassy in Tel Aviv while Israel will open one in Amman. Savir, heading a team of senior officials from Israel's foreign and finance ministries, was to work out terms of full normalization, including trade and economic ties. King Hussein paid his first public visit to Israel a week ago to exchange copies of the ratified peace treaty with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He has not visited Jerusalem, claimed by both Palestinians and Israelis. The Amman meetings discussed trade links and joint projects, including some raised at last month's Middle East economic conference in Casablanca. Under the peace treaty, both states by next May have to reach pacts on economic cooperation including setting up a free-trade area, investment, banking, industrial cooperation and labor. HAMAS MEMBERS JOIN POLICE In other developments: About 90 supporters of Hamas, the fundamentalist Muslim group regarded by Israel as a major threat to peace, have signed up for the Palestinian police in Gaza, Hamas sources said yesterday in Gaza City. It was the first time supporters of the group - the Palestine Liberation Organization's main rival in the Gaza Strip - accepted posts in Palestinian security forces set up under the PLO's peace deal with Israel. Hamas, which rejects Israel's right to exist, has pledged to fight the deal signed in 1993. The Israeli Supreme Court yesterday cleared the way for the Israeli army to destroy the family home of a Palestinian accused of a suicide bus bombing in Tel Aviv last month. The five-judge panel ruled 4-1 to reject an appeal by the family of Salah Assawi of the West Bank town of Qalqilya. Assawi allegedly carried a bomb onto a bus and set it off at a busy intersection, killing himself and 22 other people. REWARD $5000 CASH for the recovery of two container loads of dishes & pottery.

CHRETIEN'S SUCCESS IN ASIA HAS DEEP ROOTS JONATHAN MANTHGRPE SOUTHAM NEWS HANOI, Vietnam - It was billed as Team Canada, but the trade accomplishments of the last two weeks have been credited to one star player - the gangling form of Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Doubtless the hundreds of Canadian businessmen who spent the last 14 days signing contracts are happy to forego credit for the nearly $10-billion victory in the Asian market. And it is hard to quibble with a prime minister whose popularity rating is stuck firmly in the heatwave end of the political thermometer. But there is some 30 years of work behind Chretien's """"Team Canada"""" progression from Beijing to Shanghai to Hong Kong to Jakarta and finally, Hanoi. Chretien's presence was certainly important in a part of the world where reverence for power is culturally embedded and usually a wise survival technique. His political benediction of Canada's visible arrival in Asia established, as he said: """"We are a Pacific country."""" The cross-country scope of the contracts suggests appreciation of the potential of the Asian market - the fastest growing in the world and likely to stay that way - is no longer a secret known only to British Columbia and Alberta. And if the size of his mission to China and Hong Kong, where nine premiers gathered at his heels like medieval courtiers, was a bit grandiose for Canadian tastes, it went down well here. Senator Jack Austin, who knows more than most about the Asian market, said: """"In this part of the world you can't be too big."""" Even the absence of Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau was dismissed without a hint of irony by Chretien. """"I come from Quebec,"""" he told any of his hosts who asked about Parizeau's no-show. And the final tally shows Quebec got about 35 per cent of the contracts. The assertion by the province's international affairs minister, Bernard Landry, that this is all because former premier Rene Levesque visited China in 1984 somehow does not have a compelling ring. Chretien's political commitment to Canada in Asia had some measurable practical benefits, as well. Many of the 55 Beijing contracts, including the move to sell China two Candu reactors worth up to $4 billion, probably would not have been concluded without the lure of being photographed in the company of Canada's prime minister. No doubt many of the scores of photos taken of Canadian directors and their Asian partners with Chretien already decorate corporate walls from Beijing to Hanoi. Who can tell what further deals may flow from such an overt link to the corridors of power? But what was evident from even the briefest chat with the Canadians at the Asian outposts was that none of them are carpetbaggers. Most have been battling and maneuvering out here for a decade or more. Asia is a marketplace where contacts, family links, personal attention and, above all, stoic long-term commitment are essential for success. Many have already forged profitable links in Asia despite being ignored by a succession of Canadian governments. It would be unjust to say Chretien came and licked the cream off the cake that hundreds of Canadian business people have lavished decades of care baking. But it's a thought worth remembering. GERMAN SPY GIVEN 12 YEARS IN PRISON WASHINGTON POST BERLIN - Rainer Rupp, who for more than a decade passed NATO's most sensitive military secrets to the Soviet bloc, was convicted of treason yesterday and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Rainer Rupp, 49, was known to his East German handlers by the code name Topaz. Rupp's British-born wife, Ann-Christine Rupp, who had helped her husband collect and photograph top-secret documents early in his espionage career, also was found guilty and received a 22-month suspended sentence from the Duesseldorf court. German courts have shown leniency in espionage cases since the collapse of East Germany in 1989 and the end of the Cold War. Two former Stasi officers who were Topaz case officers were convicted of treason yesterday and given two-year suspended sentences.

The sofa-bed maker in Concord, just north of Toronto, was forced into receivership by the Bank of Boston on Aug. 15. John Page with Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm overseeing the receivership, said the company owed tens of millions of dollars to creditors, but has only millions of dollars in assets. There were only about 20 employees left in the factory when Price Waterhouse came on the scene last week, he said. Price Waterhouse will try to sell the company as a going concern, Page said.

We'll spend $2.4 billion over 15 years: Unitel SUSAN YELUN CANADIAN PRESS TORONTO Unitel Communications says it will invest $2.4 billion and double its workforce if it is allowed to break into the country's long-distance telephone monopoly, officials said yesterday. In a stack of 21 documents supporting its application to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the Toronto-based company said the investment will be made over the next 15 years, and predicted staff will jump to 6,700 by the end of the decade. Unitel president George Harvey said the jobs and money will be a blessing to provinces struggling against a battered economy. The figures are based on Unitel's premise that it can grab a 10-per-cent share of the Canadian long-distance market by 1998 and a 19-per-cent slice nine years later. Unitel, formerly CNCP Telecommunications, is owned by Canadian Pacific and Rogers Communications. Rogers is the country's largest supplier of cable-television services. In a bare-bones filing to the CRTC in May, the company said it could lower long-distance rates by 15 per cent in its first four years. But Bell Canada, Unitel's major competitor, suggested that cheaper long-distance calls would force local rates to rise. Bell has maintained that its costs for local-phone service have been kept low because they've been heavily subsidized by the lucrative long-distance business. But Harvey answered that criticism at a news conference yesterday, saying that a new entry in the field will force telephone companies to keep their long-distance rates low to stay competitive. """"They have already done so in the last year anticipating the introduction of PLEASE SEE UNITEL, PAGE G2 Economic forecasting Revised downward from earlier estimate JAY BRYAN THE GAZETTE Gilles Rheaume has a cartoon on his office wall that shows a man in shorts and Hawaiian shirt standing at a bus stop in the middle of a snowstorm. """"Why yes, I am an economic forecaster,"""" he says to a bystander. """"How did you know?"""" Rheaume, head of forecasting at the Conference Board of Canada, is one of Canada's leading practitioners of this much-maligned profession. Like other forecasters, he is aware that his predictions are taken with a grain of salt, but believes that's exactly as it should be. Foretelling the future is a risky business, and this has rarely been more true than today, with a looming recession, fear of a Middle East war and the gyrating price of oil making the economic outlook even murkier than usual. Factors like these will be buzzing through forecasters' minds next Friday at 10 a.m., when they begin deciding how to revise their current predictions. At that hour, Statistics Canada will make public its first estimate of how much Canada's economy grew in the three months from April through June, and which sectors grew how much. Even before the price of oil skyrocketed this month, Canada's forecasters most of whom work for banks, trust companies, stockbrokers and independent consulting firms had been cutting their estimates of 1991 economic growth. The major reason is that interest rates have remained higher than expected, squeezing spending by both consumers and business. Based on conditions in July, the Conference Board concluded that """"the risk of recession will be greater over the next six months than it has been at any time since 1982."""" And now oil prices have jumped by more than 50 per cent in a month, leaving forecasters to decide whether this will be the final straw that breaks the back of economic growth. Were oil prices to remain near their present level, there's a good chance the answer would be yes. If oil were to average $28 a barrel a few dollars lower than its present level through the end of 1991, Canada's economic growth could be cut by about 0.6 per cent next year, estimates Informetrica Ltd, an Ottawa consulting firm. Taking the Conference Board forecast of 1.1-per-cent expansion, that means economic growth would be cut in half. Informetrica economist Carl Sonnen points out that this price shock would be only about a quarter as bad as the one Canada suffered in 1980 and 1981, when oil prices doubled. However, that may be less comforting if you recall that 1981 was the year when Canada slipped into its worst recession since the 1930s. Higher oil prices would also cut purchasing power even for those unaffected by an economic slump. George Saba, chief economist with Montreal Trust, says his rough estimate is that oil prices at current levels could add as much as PLEASE SEE FORECASTERS, PAGE G2 Oil prices at current levels will add 1.5 to inflation, says economist George Saba.

GAZETTE Estimates for economic growth were reduced in the face of high interest rates. Stock market is no place to be if Mideast war breaks out Financial markets paused for a breath yesterday after a week of tumult caused by the Persian Gulf crisis. It was a week in which stock and bond prices plunged, oil prices soared, the Canadian dollar reached a 12-year high and stomachs churned. Just imagine how they feel in Tokyo, where the stock market has now declined almost 40 per cent since its peak last year and has taken even more of a beating this week from the Iraq crisis. The panic selling that hit the North American markets in mid-week abated yesterday as investors nervously waited news of whether Iraq would enforce its deadline for a shutdown of foreign embassies. With many stocks having fallen precipitously in value since July, some big institutional investors were prepared to pick up a few bargains yesterday. But the sense of gloom that pervades financial markets won't be dispelled until the Iraqi crisis is resolved. And for investors, the already volatile state of the stock and bond markets is now dramatically heightened. One Montreal stockbroker reported yesterday that his clients """"weren't overly concerned"""" about the Iraqi situation. """"People are more worried about their own jobs and incomes right now than about their investments,"""" he says. """"But if you want my personal opinion,"""" the broker adds, """"I think the stock market could go much lower. If a war breaks out, and there's chemical warfare and Americans are getting shot, this market is going to fall like nothing you've seen yet."""" PETER HADEKBL From an investment point of view, this is really no time to be placing bets, no matter how calculated. """"Never fight a war in the financial markets,"""" says Bill Ram, an investment strategist at Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. """"Leave it to the military."""" The threat to world financial markets from a Middle East conflict is incalculable, he says. No one can build an economic model of what could happen, and financial markets can only react to developments rather than anticipate them. Previous military conflicts such as the Vietnam and the Korean wars didn't involve a strategic commodity such as oil. The economic stakes from a Mideast war would be much higher. One investment firm ventured the opinion this week that if Saudi Arabian oil exports were disrupted by a military confrontation, oil prices could climb to between $40 and $50 a barrel, which would throw the world economy out of whack. The situation is inherently unpredictable because of the involvement of Saddam Hussein. Whenever the U.S. and the Soviets squared off in a global crisis, there was a sense that the world knew exactly how far each side was prepared to go. With Saddam Hussein, nobody knows. The cost of war on the economy would be significant, simply because there's so little room left to mitigate the impact. In North America, we spent most of the 1980s dodging a series of economic bullets, including the huge increase in government deficits, the steep rise in the indebtedness of corporations and consumers, the weakening of the banking system and the crash of stock markets in 1987. After eight years of growth, we now have an economy heading into recession, and faced with the added prospect of higher oil prices and higher interest rates because of the Persian Gulf crisis. In Canada, the Iraqi caper has disrupted what was clearly a window of opportunity for the Bank of Canada to bring interest rates down. Corporate profits have been whacked by a combination of high borrowing costs, an overvalued dollar, low commodity prices, slow sales and escalating labor costs. """"The manufacturing sector is already in a recession and clearly doesn't need the added trouble of a conflict in the Persian Gulf. With luck, the guns of August will stay silent and the economic blockade of Iraq will be effective soon. The other alternatives are too unpleasant to think about.""",1,19900825,modern,Snowstorm,0,0,0,0,0,0,

voters to the polls, preferably sooner than later In the 2004 election campaign the party lost many seats in Quebec simply because federalist voters stayed home The party will not make the same mistake, with extra efforts to get voters to advance polling stations in case of a snowstorm on election day Lapierre said Lapierre made the comments in an interview as party leaders jump-started their campaigns In Quebec, Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe was the first to leap back in, zooming in on news that the RCMP have opened a criminal investigation into an information leak from the Finance Department A few hours later, Conservative leader Stephen Harper flew his campaign into Jonquiere, announcing regional details on his party's new defence plan He said the Conservatives plan to station a new rapid-reaction army battalion of 650 regular force personnel at nearby CFB Bagotville The moves come as a new poll shows support for the Bloc steady at 52 per cent in Quebec Lapierre said the current Liberal support of about 30 per cent compares with where the party was at the end of the 2004 campaign-meaning it has not slipped dramatically and the party this time around is much better organized The Bloc, which won 54 of the province's 75 seats in 2004, has targeted key ridings which the Liberals lost or nearly lost in 2004, including Jeanne Le Ber, where star Liberal candidate Liza Frulla narrowly beat Bloc candidate Thierry St-Cyr by 72 votes Yesterday Frulla said she used the Christmas break to attend numerous parties and get together to raise her profile In 2004 she was not as present in the riding because she was working on the national campaign Frulla said that besides standing up for local riding issues, she is reminding voters that by voting Bloc they are hurting federalism in Quebec and that spells trouble for a future referendum """"We have to make people understand that this is serious business here,"""" Frulla said """"By weakening us, it

the stage for a week of policy announcements that were largely absent in the first month of the election campaign Harper yesterday announced a number of defence initiatives in Bagotville, including stationing a new 650-member rapid reaction army battalion out of CFB Bagotville Harper said the base would also receive an upgrade of the existing fleet of CF-18 jet fighters The Tories say they would increase army personnel levels in Quebec by recruiting an estimated 1,000 regular forces and 750 reserves, the majority at CFB Valcartier Also yesterday, a new Ipsos-Reid poll for CanWest News Service and Global National suggested more Canadians trust the Conservatives to handle the issue of gangs and gun violence The poll asked respondents which party they believe would do the best job responding to violence such as the Boxing Day shooting in Toronto Conservatives received 36 per cent support vs 24 per cent for the Liberals and 19 per cent for the NDP The issue is expected to be pivotal in southern Ontario The poll was conducted Dec 30 to Jan. 2 A total of 8,336 Canadian voters were surveyed via the Internet, yielding results that are accurate to within 1.1 percentage points 19 times out of 20 Harper talked tough on crime yesterday """"On Boxing Day, residents of Toronto watched in horror as the city was ravaged by gunfire in open daylight,"""" the Tory leader told a campaign

of the Tory plan, which has yet to be fully spelled out, is mandatory prison sentences for repeat serious offenders Meanwhile, National Democratic Party leader Jack Layton said during a stop in Ottawa yesterday that laws governing the possession of firearms have to be changed if Canada is to avert new incidents of gun violence-but that such changes won't be enough """"We need more enforcement and the Liberals have been responsible for the decline in the support for the RCMP over the years and of course the auditor-general has called for more investment in enforcement for quite some time,""""

Default,288,"A4 CRVR D5 PETER McCABE THE GAZETTE A tractor-trailer lies between the lanes on Highway 40 in Vaudreuil, off the western tip of Montreal Island, early yesterday. Why didn't they see it coming? EXPERTS BLINDSIDED 'Very unusual pattern' came from east ANNE SUTHERLAND GAZETTE WEATHER REPORTER The first snowstorm of the season caught everyone - including weather forecasters - with their snow pants down around their ankles. The four centimetres of snow called for Monday had turned into an unexpected 20 centimetres by yesterday morning, compounded by wicked, gale-force winds. Another 10 centimetres fell during the day, until - at 5:24 p.m. - Environment Canada ended its snowfall warning for Montreal and Laval. Overnight, though, a further two centimetres were expected in the form of light flurries - bringing the accumulated grand total by this morning to roughly 32 centimetres. Plea from the city: Big cleanup push starts this morning CATHERINE WILTON THE GAZETTE The city of Montreal is pleading with motorists to make a switch to public transit over the next several days - with winter's first snowstorm expected by this morning to have dumped about 32 centimetres overall of the white stuff since the flakes began piling up Monday. """"We want people to leave their cars at home - that will help us get rid of the snow more quickly,"""" said Yves Girard, the city's chief of snow-clearing operations. Girard said blowing snow and gusting winds created havoc for city workers who began plowing city streets Monday night, after the city was unexpectedly walloped with far more than the four centimetres Environment Canada had forecast Monday afternoon. """"The conditions were difficult. The visibility was bad and workers would clear a street and then have to come back and do it again and again,"""" Girard said. For the second day, about 1,000 workers yesterday plowed snow from major roads, sidewalks, bus lanes and outside of hospitals and Quebec communities POSTMEDIA NEWS Rimouski - A combination of high tides, rain and gusting winds prompted officials to evacuate hundreds of homes in eastern Quebec this week as the safety of residents was threatened by floods and damaged foundations. THE GAZETTE montrealgazette.com A f V A Jl G The city is going to close the road for up to two years to allow workers to install a new sewer system and facilitate the construction of the McGill University Health Centre's superhospital. However, the city went ahead yesterday with plans to close the Girouard Ave access ramp onto Highway 15 southbound. kwiltonmontrealgazette.com seasonal high tides - measuring three to 4.5 metres - were less likely to be accompanied by 80-90-kilometre-per-hour winds that together formed a potent combination along Quebec's coast. Bad weather plagued much of the country yesterday. AMT promises nightmare year won't be replayed Measures put in place to improve communication with commuters fail ANDY RIGA GAZETTE TRANSPORTATION REPORTER Long delays on some suburban train lines during the season's first snowstorm don't foreshadow another winter of discontent for commuters, the Agence métropolitaine de transport insisted yesterday. The afternoon rush-hour scene at downtown Montreal's Lucien L'Allier train station Monday: Late and cancelled trains, a chaotic atmosphere and poor communication with hundreds of commuters - some of whom waited two hours for trains home to the West Island and points beyond. Vaudreuil-Hudson, the AMT's second-busiest line, used by 15,000 people daily, was the hardest hit; train service was down from 5 p.m. """"We were waiting in the station like cattle,"""" Michelle Lessard said until about 6:45 p.m. There were also delays on the Blainville-St. Jerome and Delson lines. For AMT users, it looked a lot like the miserable winter of 2008-09, when the AMT was pilloried for poor service and its inability to inform commuters. The transit authority apologized, offered refunds and promised to do better. Last night, two of the 34 rush-hour commuter-train runs departing downtown were tardy, said AMT official Brigitte Leonard. The 5:40 p.m. to Vaudreuil-Hudson was delayed 29 minutes """"by a mechanical problem,"""" she said. The 6 p.m. train for Mont-Saint-Hilaire was held immobile on the Victoria Bridge for 12 minutes by a signalling problem. On Monday, measures put in place to improve communication with commuters utterly failed. Screens that were supposed to display information about delays provided no data. Technology that was supposed to alert users via cellphone and email failed. Public-address systems that were supposed to give passengers accurate info about trains offered no help. Commuters, many of whom had no alternate ways to reach far-flung suburbs, got little help from the few AMT employees around, who often provided contradictory information. Leonard attributed all those failures to a single """"technical bug,"""" which she said was found and fixed in time for last night's rush hour. """"I would have liked to have been informed about what the heck was going on,"""" said SNOWSTORM BLUES Gazette readers weigh in on the storm and its aftermath: stuck commuter trains, unplowed sidewalks, a late start to clearing the streets. Letters, Pag A26 and montrealgazette.com There was no let-up in sight for the residents of London, Ont., where 30 centimetres fell on top of the previous metre of snow, forcing businesses to close early and shutting down transit services altogether. From Western Canada - where 100 to 180 millimetres of rain was forecast for parts of British Columbia - to the Maritimes, where residents are cleaning up after high winds and heavy rain caused major flooding Monday, Canada is waking up to a reminder that winter is here - even if the calendar says it's two weeks away.

If students want a quality education, which will handsomely profit them through their working lives, they should pay a fairer share of the cost than they are now. There is no question that Quebec universities are underfunded in large part because tuition fees in the province are ridiculously low - less than half the Canadian average. Overall funding for Quebec universities is 20 per cent less per student than the national average, a difference that is felt in overcrowded classrooms and a comparative shortage of full-fledged professors. University heads are pressing for a fee increase spread over the coming four years that would bring tuition in Quebec to $3,680 per year, an increase of more than 70 per cent from the current $2,075, but still leaving tuition here well below the current national undergrad average of $5,138. The rationale advanced by the provincial student federation and its union backers in the cause for keeping tuition at rock bottom is that it favours greater access to university education, particularly for the financially strapped. If that were so, Quebec would be leading the country in university enrolment, but in fact university attendance among Quebecers aged 18 to 25 is second lowest among Canadian provinces. As such, the effect of the Quebec system is that it subsidizes the relatively affluent more than it aids the unfortunate. The argument that students are hit with crippling debt upon graduation is negated by a respectable recent study that shows holders of bachelor's degrees alone will earn on average $600,000 more over their careers than will high-school grads. For most of those who venture it, a university education is the best investment they'll have made in their lives. Of course raising tuition is not the only improvement that needs to be made to bolster Quebec's universities. Along with the fee increase there should be an improvement in the loan and bursary system to ensure the deserving needy have access. Rather than an across-the-board undergraduate fee, a tuition scale might be set based on the cost of programs. Universities might also be held to better accounting and performance measurement; ill-considered spending on expansion projects has in some cases sorely aggravated the university funding shortage. As well, private enterprise should step up its contribution to the university system since, along with the grads themselves and the governments that will tax them, it is a prime beneficiary of a well-educated workforce. Yes, fees should rise, but students alone shouldn't have to bear the cost of improving the system. Whistleblowers need better protection Without whistleblowers, Canadians might not have found out that the Canadian military was handing over Afghan detainees to possible torture. And Quebecers might have remained in the dark for much longer than they did about corruption in the construction industry - at their considerable cost. But if the public is grateful that previously hidden facts are dragged into the light of day, governments are not always so appreciative. Last year, Richard Colvin, an intelligence officer at the Canadian embassy in Washington, told a parliamentary committee that senior government officials knew Canadian Forces were handing Afghan detainees over to probable torture by Afghan authorities in 2006-2007. He immediately found himself under attack from Defence Minister Peter MacKay. That was one of the big cases. Whistleblowers who try to warn their employers of less high-profile violations are even more vulnerable to reprisals. That's why whistleblower protection is so important. It is in the best interests of taxpayers that public employees be free to reveal wrongdoing. For that to happen, they need a designated authority with the power and tools to investigate and at the same time protect the whistleblower. Yet in Montreal and Ottawa, whistleblower protection is under real pressure. In Ottawa, the """"hear-no-evil"""" attitude of Canada's first public-sector integrity commissioner was so outrageous, federal auditor general Sheila Fraser has had to investigate. Fifty-eight whistleblowers complained to the commissioner that they suffered reprisals after alleging wrongdoing. Four complaints were investigated. The two that have been completed were both rejected: Hardly encouragement to future whistleblowers. Here in Montreal, the city set up a hotline last year for city employees and suppliers to report any wrongdoing they witness. To date, 128 reports have been made. Did that number come as a nasty surprise to the Tremblay administration? Is that why the city has decided to take the hotline away from the city's auditor general and give it to the city comptroller instead? It is a shameful and transparent ploy to take control of the complaints system. That hotline must remain under the auditor-general. Only his office is completely independent. He alone can launch an inquiry independently of civic authorities. Taxpayers need to know that someone independent is in their corner. The federal government has to get serious about protecting whistleblowers. The city should leave the hotline with the auditor-general. Good transit; lousy clearing I commend the Société de transport de Montreal for its bus service over the last couple of days. While my Monday evening commute took two hours and the Tuesday morning commute was almost as long, the bus drivers I saw were doing the best they could. On the other hand, once again, there was no attempt anywhere to shovel access to the bus stops or the sidewalks at Lionel-Groulx metro station. I witnessed hundreds of people struggling over snow banks to board buses and get to the metro. Instead of wasting money to hire people in the summer to pick up cigarette butts on the street, why not have them shovel bus stops and metro entrances? Douglas O'Shaughnessy Beaconsfield AMT fouls up again The first snowstorm; the Agence métropolitaine de transport's West Island trains die. Surprise, surprise! One hour sitting on the tracks in nowhere land. There was a lady on the train visiting from Nova Scotia. Could one word of explanation be in English? Of course not! Donna Ekins Dorval Gross incompetence I am again amazed at the gross incompetence of our city at clearing snow. They want people to take public transit, and yet there I was at 1 p.m. yesterday - 24 hours after snow started to fall, and city crews had yet to clear the sidewalk that leads to our local train station. Pedestrians are expected to fight with cars for the right of way on the road. Gee, I wonder why people insist on driving their cars. Every year it is the same thing. Every year the same excuses are provided. When will our city officials do their jobs properly? The plows should have been out yesterday afternoon so people could get home at the end of the day, not waited till the middle of the night. Simple incompetence! Daniel Plneault Pointe Claire Montrealers were frustrated by the Island's snow-clearing efforts. It's not just the weather Here we go again, with the snow from driveways dumped into the street and onto the sidewalk. The city is doing a fairly good job of making sure people can walk on a half-decently cleared sidewalk, but some contractors do a much better job making sure the sidewalks are full of snow from the driveways. If the city is looking for extra revenues, instead of taxing us to death maybe they should find a way to tax these contractors. Alain Houle Notre Dame de Grace Do these people know winter? Remind me again why the anti-Montreal Mayor Gerald Tremblay is raising taxes? It snowed all day and all night Monday and at 8 a.m. Tuesday the sidewalks were still not cleared. I have to assume the people in charge have never gone through a Canadian winter, or else they are totally ineffective. Diann Whittaker Montreal Missed treat Yesterday morning's Gazette delivery was delayed by Monday's snowfall. Entirely understandable. So I read the """"paper"""" online. Entirely unsatisfactory, but there's still nothing like spreading the paper out over the breakfast table with a cup of fresh morning coffee. Maybe I'm too old-fashioned but I'll keep my subscription to the real newspaper. Paul Shubin Montreal Fair play for 'burbs Re: """"Suburbs cry foul over budget"""" (Gazette, Dec. 3), The suburbs are being asked to help to fund not only transportation and infrastructure projects, but to prop up the city of Montreal's employee pension plan. The cheek of this move is beyond belief. I don't object to paying my fair share of taxes, but the notion that """"the more a suburb's commercial and industrial base grows, the more that suburb has to pay in transfer payments"""" really gets my goat. Dorval Mayor Edgar Rouleau is justified in being annoyed at, in effect, being penalized for providing a sound economic base for his municipality. Will the tax burden for Dorval, for instance, be reduced if it is left to stagnate? Lilian Hart Dorval Snakes? Yuck! Re: """"Turcot work means snakes will have to move"""" (Gazette, Dec. 6), At least $50,000 to save the snakes at Turcot? I can't believe it. Nobody cares about snakes. Most people have a phobia about these disgusting creatures, a phobia so bad that many couldn't even read this article. While the city is at it, why doesn't it save all the rats that infest condemned buildings? Brandon St. Onge Pierrefonds Wrong answer Re: """"Squeaky wheels"""" (Gazette, Dec. 6), Transport Quebec spokesperson Mario St-Pierre gave us an insight into why some things just don't make sense when it comes to road work in our province. Instead of warning drivers a couple of exits in advance of any road closings, he suggests we go online or call Transport Quebec to get an update for any road work. This embarrassing answer to a very logical request just proves the incompetence of those running Transport Quebec. It's much more logical to have a few road workers place a few warning signs, rather than have tens of thousands of drivers going online or calling for road work updates. Kyriakos Mamlis Laval A vocation, not a job Re: """"Schools can afford to let boys be boys"""" (Opinion, Dec. 7), Ann Tellier's article was one of the sweetest pieces of writing I have seen in a long time. Teaching's not a job, it's a vocation, a calling (like nursing). You have to love to teach and you have to love, accept and respect children and listen to them. And yes, boys are different from girls. They might be more energetic, more antsy, more disruptive but both are so special and so precious and so fascinating.

Thirty-one school children are missing in Turner County, seven were lost near Lennox, and a teacher and sixteen children at Clear Lake, six of the latter's bodies having been discovered.

Default,294,"5 E. McEachran's Return, July viewed by a Gazette reporter on his trip through the Northwest. I note of the wheat crop of the Territories. The ranches present new developments in horse breeding. Since the Northwest Territories have become the granary of the Dominion, all experienced men arriving in Montreal from beyond the lakes are closely questioned by Montreal merchants and capitalists as to the condition of the crops at this critical period of their growth. Dr. McEachran, chief veterinary inspector for the Dominion, who has just gone over Manitoba and a large portion of Alberta and the other territories, was seen by a Gazette reporter on this subject, and spoke as follows: ""In Manitoba the crops are very promising, and although the straw may be a little shorter than usual, the wheat will probably mature earlier on this account."" I spent a day in Brandon, drove about the country considerably, and from the splendid outlook in that section I take it for granted that everything there is all right. They are now favored with beautiful weather and have had plenty of rain. The doctor then described the large immigrant trains he met with and the number of well-to-do English gentlemen who were going over the country selecting suitable farms for their sons. ""He, in fact, was much pleased at the quality of this year's influx into Western Canada."" The reporter questioned the doctor as to the condition of the ranches in Alberta this year, and he replied that the April blizzard had caused considerable losses, more particularly along Willow Creek and the level country east of the rolling foothills. The large ranches, such as Cochran's and Walrond's, escaped with comparatively little loss, as was evidenced by both of those ranches branding a very small number less than last year. The season, however, was dry, especially in the McLeod district, yet the stock never looked in better condition than at the present time. Ranching, however, continued Dr. McEachran, ""is in an uncertain and unsettled condition pending the decision of the Department of the Interior with reference to the lands leased to the different companies nine years ago."" While I was in Alberta several meetings were held by the ranchmen for the purpose of laying their views before the Government. One memorial in particular asked the Ottawa authorities to appoint a commission to report upon the whole question before deciding upon a policy which might possibly lead to the closing out of the whole ranch business and the withdrawal of from six to eight million dollars of capital which has been invested in that business in Alberta. ""Horse breeding,"" said Dr. McEachran, ""is going on in a most satisfactory manner. I visited Quorn Ranch, which has 1,000 horses, High River 900, Cross Ranch 800, Winder 800 and our own ranch, which breeds 700 heavy horses such as Clydes and Shires. I met Mr. Gordon Cuthbert and Mr. Polkes, who were visiting the different ranches selecting horses to the extent of 100 for an experimental shipment to Great Britain. These gentlemen purpose taking the horses, which are principally carriage, saddle and hunters, to Seary's farm in Bothwell, Ont., where they will be broken and mannered, preparatory to their shipment from Montreal towards the end of September. I also visited the Pagan Indians as they were preparing for a sun dance at Fort McLeod and found the tribe making most satisfactory progress in agriculture. The agent said the Indians worked well in the fields, and the leaders of the tribe added that they were quite contented with their lot. The doctor also stated that the Calgary and Edmonton railway construction party had reached the new town site of Fort McLeod and, were it not for a slight delay caused in getting the sleepers down from the mountains, the road would be finished by the middle of August. It is from this point that the proposed Canadian Pacific extension through the Crow's Seat Pass will start.

Default,295,"GEORGE AND THE DRAGON A writer, who evidently knows his subject thoroughly not by hearsay, but by experience, discusses in Blackwood the value of Wei-Hai-Wei. The policy by which it was acquired and the terms by which it is held, he does not approve of. Its seizure was the result of surprise. That Russia would eventually occupy Port Arthur was looked upon by those who had been watching events as fairly certain, and yet the occupation came so suddenly that it proved almost as disconcerting as if such a thing had never been contemplated as possible. The British Government through the press and otherwise let the world know that Russia's action had flurried it. For a time there was a great deal of talk about the open door and then, a squadron having been sent to Cheefoo, over against Port Arthur seventy miles off, Wei-Hai-Wei was taken possession of and a clause was inserted in the lease that England would hold it as long as Russia remained at Port Arthur. What that means it is not hard to decipher. It was authoritatively given out that the Government intended to make Wei-Hai-Wei a secondary naval base. Under certain circumstances such a course might be wise enough; but, in view of the fact that Russia is rapidly turning Port Arthur into a first-class fortress, with an absolutely impregnable harbor capable of sheltering 100 torpedo boats or 50 destroyers of the Sokol type, such a policy would be a grave strategic error. In fact, Wei-Hai-Wei is worse than useless to England unless a defensible harbor is constructed there and the island adequately fortified. If the necessary breakwater were commenced at once, all that could be effectively accomplished before Russia could have her strategic railways completed and be ready (if such action were deemed advisable) to begin an advance upon Peking. The writer in Blackwood admits (though not without sarcasm) that Lord Salisbury may have information of which he knows nothing, but he has no faith in secrecy or the pretense of it in these days of an ubiquitous press. The question in which the Empire is concerned especially that important portion of it that is interested in Chinese trade is whether the Government really purposes to defend the trade interests of northern China. If so, the policy indicated may have its use. Now, moreover, is the time to act, when Russia is in a peaceful mood and friendly her strategic railways being still unfinished and Port Arthur being dependent on the sea routes for its supplies. What about the climate of Wei-Hai-Wei? It would be an insult to that future stronghold, says the writer in Blackwood, to compare it to Hong Kong, and it is not hot and relaxing like Yokohama. In fine, he believes it to be the healthiest in the world. Spring and autumn are magnificent. There is adequate rainfall, plenty of sunshine, and though the four months' winter is cold, it is a bright, clear, dry, bracing cold, with neither rain nor fog, and but little snow. Still, he mentions occasional blizzards an average perhaps of one a fortnight which sometimes bring a little snow and blow from west round to north. While these blizzards last from one day to three days the air is keen and cutting, but quite dry. The weather between blizzards is compared to that of the Riviera in winter and even superior to it, being drier and more bracing with more brilliant sunshine. We have outlined only the practical features of the article. Lord Beresford's proposals are condemned as dividing the powers of civilization into two great hostile camps. But he considers China's disintegration as only a matter of time. The great wall of exclusion is a thing of the past. The era of the railway has begun. The remotest interior will soon be open to foreign trade, England must share her monopoly with others, but she has held her own before under unfavorable circumstances and she need not despair now. The proposal to give the Northwest half-breeds another issue of land scrip may be in the interest of somebody, but certainly it is not in that of the half-breeds. After the rising of 1885 a commission was sent up to settle the 'bleeds' claims with scrip, and most of the stuff passed into the hands of speculators within a few hours of issue. It cost the Government a large sum, and did the recipients the least possible amount of good. It will be the same with future issues. The half-breed does not take to farming and does not need land, else he could get all he wants on the same conditions as white settlers. He is a picturesquely decaying survival of a past time, to pamper whom is to waste money. The English landlady who refused to serve a feminine cyclist because she wore bloomers has been paralleled by a landlord who had a lady ejected by the police because she persisted in smoking a cigarette. He also prosecuted her for disorderly conduct in refusing to leave the premises when ordered. The magistrate dismissed the summons, but held that the landlord was right in making and enforcing a rule against ladies smoking, as it might tend to make the lewd and less thoughtful members of society rather inclined to joking. And this while it may tend to promote morality in public, seems to be somewhat like punishing a woman for man's rudeness. Mr",1,18990705,historical,blizzard,0,0,0,0,0,0,

The style and cut of our wearing apparel, and the desire to have it made from materials chaste and becoming and the prevailing pattern, is also not to be condemned as a vanity, but rather as an evidence of refinement.

""Emergencies, surgical and medical."" Another of the lectures of this interesting course was delivered in the Association Hall last evening by Dr. Roddick. The chair was occupied by Mr. H. Putnam. Dr. Roddick, in opening, dwelt on the importance of everyone having some knowledge of the proper course to pursue in the emergencies of a medical or surgical nature which were constantly arising. How often do we hear of accidents often resulting fatally, which a little knowledge on the part of friends or bystanders might have prevented? He would dwell more particularly on those emergencies in which loss of consciousness was the most prominent condition. Probably the most common of these is fainting or syncope. This is due to a variety of causes. There are some persons who faint on the slightest provocation, who, in fact, make a habit of fainting. This is due to the weak or watery condition of the blood, by which the heart muscle itself, from a defective supply of blood, is constantly refusing to perform its functions. Another common cause is a sudden blow, particularly in the region of the stomach. Those who die from drinking cold water when they are heated die generally in a faint, the effect being similar to that produced by a blow in the stomach. Other causes are loss of blood, sudden emotions, or the use of chloroform. The symptoms are dimness of sight, noises in the ears, the lips and cheeks bloodless and the features have a pinched look, the beat of the heart is not noticed, and the breathing ceases for a moment. This lasts from a few seconds to two or three minutes but not longer. If the heart pulsations are absent for five minutes, resuscitation is impossible. Recovery is usually first announced by a sighing or swallowing, then the return of colour and warmth. The treatment is first, to place the patient in a recumbent position, and the head lower than the shoulders; because if this is not done to patients who have inhaled the influence of chloroform in the dental chair, we frequently hear of cases where death results. The lecturer is thoroughly opposed to the use of chloroform as an anesthetic and advised his hearers to use the safer, and generally equally sure ether when at their dentist's, as when the latter is used the upright position is not dangerous. In the next place the clothing about the neck should be loosened, the chest and face sprinkled with cold water, and the palms of the hands slapped and rubbed briskly. Ammonia may be applied to the nostrils, but with caution, as in a dull case person it is possible by this means to substitute asphyxia for syncope. Strong coffee is a very effective stimulant, and if these fail a galvanic battery may be resorted to, but this also should be used with great caution. Convulsions were next treated of. They are rare in adults, and are then almost always of an epileptic nature. The lecturer fully described the symptoms, which are so well known as not to require enumeration. As to the treatment, he particularly cautioned against holding a person in a fit; so long as he was guarded from harm, his muscles should be allowed free play, as otherwise the result might be very serious. Hysterical fits, which are often mistaken for epilepsy, are distinguished by the fact that in them the patient generally selects a soft place to fall, never bites his tongue, and is conscious of what is going on. The treatment recommended was cold water applications. Convulsions appear most frequently amongst infants, and in these cases are due most ordinarily to teething or disorders of digestion. The first thing to be done is to strip the child and examine it carefully, because the convulsions may be caused by something pricking the body. There is seldom any need for alarm, as a child very rarely dies from such convulsions. The body of the child should be placed in hot bath of 98 to 100, the head at the same time being kept cool, an important matter which is often neglected. The bath should not last longer than five minutes, but may be repeated after an interval of twenty minutes. After the bath, do not attempt to dry the child, but wrap it in a large towel and then in a blanket. An emetic may then be administered, alum being probably the best, and a dose of oil will never do harm. In drowning accidents, the vast majority do not die as is commonly supposed by cramps but rather from syncope or fainting. The faint may be caused by a blow against the stomach received on entering the water, or on the knee from some injury in the river bed. Those who take cramps can generally be resuscitated, but those who faint usually die. The treatments consist in (1) producing artificial respiration, Sylvester's method being probably the best, (2) producing warm water friction, and (3) stimulation. The face should be first turned downwards to allow the water, etc., to flow out. The body should then be turned over, and the tongue drawn and kept out of the mouth. Wet clothes should then be removed, especially from the chest, and a dry coat or blanket placed on the patient. The limbs should be rubbed briskly, the friction being towards the heart, and warmth may be applied by hot bottles. The instructions given above would apply, with slight modification, to cases of suspended animation from poisoning by coal gas or chloroform, attempted suicide by hanging, and cases of a similar nature. Sunstroke occurs especially in those who are depressed from physical exertion, e.g., soldiers on the march. The symptoms are well known. The sufferer should be removed to a cool place and placed with the head raised a little. The body should be stripped, and ice-cold water poured on the chest, limbs and head from a height of four or five feet. In cases where foreign bodies find their way into the ear, eye or other cavities of the body, the following modes of treatment will be found useful: If in the nose a pinch of snuff or pepper will generally cause such a fit of sneezing as will have the desired effect. Failing in this, a hairpin or an injection of water may be used. In the ear it is generally best to remove the foreign body by syringing the ear. Foreign substances in the eye can generally be removed by bathing with water. At the conclusion of the lecture a vote of thanks was proposed by Mr. Win. Robb, seconded by Dr. Basin and heartily accorded to by the audience. Dr. Roddick will continue the subject in a future lecture. W. Bacon, of Norwich, Conn., wages a firm contest against liquor dealers. The applicants for licenses and the commissioners find in him an unbudgeable objector. When the case of a certain firm was up the other day he objected on the ground that they were the confederates of the worst criminals in the town. ""Do you mean that?"" said one of the men. ""I do,"" replied the clergyman. ""If you repeat it I will have you arrested and make you prove what you say,"" shouted the man. Mr. Bacon deliberately: ""I charge you with being the confederate of the worst criminals in town."" The firm's application was signed by respectable citizens, said the commissioners, and endorsed by the selectmen, ""which makes us, in Mr. Bacon's judgement, the endorsers of a brothel."" ""That is undoubtedly the truth,"" interjected the clergyman. The Army and Navy Gazette of the 4th Instant says: ""As Lord Dufferin's name appears in the Army List, we would draw attention to the pre-eminent claims of this, the greatest diplomatist of the age, to a substantial recognition of his services during the late campaign in Egypt.

NOVA SCOTIA M:HS, total gunillugnarrMml-Pir in Sydney Mines, Halifax, January 27. A man named Tupper, residing at Tor-wu, met with an accident on Sunday evening that resulted in his death. He started alone on a shooting expedition in the morning and it is supposed that while returning towards home in the afternoon his gun was accidentally discharged and its contents passed through his body. When his remains were discovered near the Methodist camp meeting grounds it was found that a bullet from the gun had entered at one side beneath the arm and come out about the shoulders on the other side. Fire has been discovered in a passage in the Sydney coal mine, leading to an unused room about a mile from the pit mouth. Efforts have been made to check its advance by isolating the burning portion of the mine by banking and shutting off the air supply, and it is thought to be under control, but, should this course not prove successful, the mine will be flooded. A PLUMBING FOR A WINDOW, How Two Engineers Shot and Curved Each Other, Utica, January 27. Particulars of a desperate encounter between two rival suitors are coming to light. It seems that two young men in well-to-do circumstances, one a foreigner and the other an Irishman, became enamored with a blooming middle-aged widow who keeps a restaurant in the lower town. The fair dispenser of liquids seems to have divided her smiles about equally between her two admirers, as they became desperately jealous of each other, the hatred between them finally culminating a couple of days ago in a bloody fight. By agreement the two men, accompanied by friends, met in a country locality near Levis and opened operations by firing at each other with pistols at the regulation distance. This they found too slow and drew knives and hacked at each other in true wild west style until separated. The foreigner is now in the hospital with a bullet hole through his hip and several knife thrusts in his body. His opponent, it seems, escaped with lighter punishment, having received only a few slight cuts. A magisterial enquiry has been opened, which will throw more light on the affair. THE FLIT TO RECKON, Quebec, January 27.

THE WEATHER, Toronto, January 28, 1 a.m. A depression from the southwestern states is now passing south of the lakes with snow. Light snow falling in Southern Ontario, but it is fine elsewhere. Very cold weather continues throughout the country, except in the extreme Northwest, where it is much milder. Cautionary signals have been ordered up at the Maritime ports. Probabilities: St. Lawrence, Upper Increasing easterly, shifting to northwesterly winds; cloudy weather, with snow, stationary or slightly higher temperatures. If you are going up to Ottawa for the opening of parliament be sure to secure your tickets in advance. The driving park - Opening of the Toronto Bleu Tobogganing Slide - The Ice structures At the Rink - Incident of the Day, in which the chief thought of the city present that it is a full of novelty and charm, in a mild and limitless way, in which the thousands of visitors who come in from all sides. In the daytime a constant procession of handsome sleighs occupied the roadways, whilst on the sidewalk the ever-recurring figures of skaters, cold and queued young people of both sexes lent a picturesque brightness to the sight. At night these same streets appear to be a constant blaze, where the flash would be the sparkle of the lights, the dazzling effect of the ton, if pyrotechnics, on the island a glaring volcano with a serpentine trail extending across the boulevard to the city streets, formed by the snowshoe procession as it wended its way from the starting point on the island; in the squares, on the Champ de Mars, the ice structures, balconies, condors and lions, all aglow with light; at the tobogganing hills more light and bright picturesque continue, all forming an ensemble to be equaled nowhere else on the face of the earth. Yesterday the visitors had a taste of cold Canadian weather, the thermometer being way down below zero, but in the bright bracing air no one thought of cold. The program for the day was carried out most successfully and the different features were full of interest. Today the chief event will be, of course, the storming of the ice palace, which takes place this evening, and is the crowning glory of the carnival. The snowshoe race over the mountain, which took place yesterday afternoon, did not attract as large an assemblage to witness the sport as in previous years, a state of things due to a great extent to the mistake in the first edition of the official program, and very largely copied, in the effect that the event would be held on Wednesday afternoon. There was, however, a fairly good crowd at the foot of the lavish sheet and all along the route to witness what proved to be the fastest race ever run over the mountain course, and for such a cold day a most remarkable event. A few minutes past four the following racers took up their positions: K. Larkin, H. D. Jones, W. Wray, Kniciald snowshoe club; H. McTaugart, I. Starke, W. Kerr, Montreal; A. H. Graham. Their Excellencies expressed great pleasure on their arrival at the foot of the slide, but were evidently feeling the effects of their drive across the boulevard and return. A laughable episode at the time of His Excellency's arrival at the top of the slide was an American gentleman with a huge snowball, which he applied occasionally to his nasal appendage, which had been frozen early in the afternoon, and which he said needed ""keeping in trim"" so long as he continued to slide, and that ""I mean to keep it up till supper time, I swear."" A lady attempted to cross the slide and was knocked down but not badly hurt. A very large number of spectators and sliders were present, but the arrangements were perfect and everybody happy. THIS TOQUE BUCK, The formal opening of the Tuque Bleue toboggan slide took place last evening and was a most successful affair. A number of gas lamps of the new style have been placed on the sidewalk on St. Catherine street opposite the foot of the slide, while the fence was beautifully decorated with Chinese lanterns. Inside the fence a large bonfire was kept blazing, which was surrounded during the evening by the cold and shivering crowd who were not sliding. The chute was hung across with rows of Chinese lanterns, while another row ran down each side of the slide. The effect was most beautiful. The slide was illuminated at night. A'ehh-k hv twn Ini-tra! FINANCIAL, Tuesday Evening, The New York market was firmer, the lead rate being advanced 1/8 to 4 7/8. Actual rates were 4 7/8 for 60-day bills, 4 7/8 for demand bills, 4 7/8 for cable, firmer. Money remains easy and dull in New York at 1 percent on call. The New York market was strong in the main today, prices ruling higher all along, and closing at an advance on yesterday's figures, in spite of downward turn toward the close. Advices from Wall street yesterday were to the effect that the average impression among traders yesterday was bearish and lower prices were expected, especially for the main and trunk lines. Advices from Philadelphia this morning do not announce any new cut in rates by the Pennsylvania company. People who are usually well informed and conservative in their views say there is no doubt of the critical condition of the coal combination, and they declare that they would not be surprised to see Lackawanna break to 60 before the middle of the week and a still greater decline in Delaware and Hudson. Morgan is reported to have quit trading in Lackawanna and has switched into Northwest, on which he is very bullish. It is reported that Higgli A. Pine have bought about 70,000 shares of Lackawanna from 80 down. Russell Wage states that he is doing very little in stock at present and is selling unstock privilege. The Gould people warn their friends against selling good stocks short at the current price, and they declare they are as bullish as ever and have not changed their views on the situation. Gould says that prices are already too low, and so many sound securities have passed from weak into strong hands that there is no margin for profits on short sales. Private Washington advices regarding the Southern railroad matters are regarded as very unfavorable for the prospects. The Judiciary committee's report upon the Union Pacific 11-year extension is expected to pass almost unanimously, and if the decision of the court of claims on what constitutes net earnings under the Thurman act is favorable, Union and Central Pacific are considered big purchases. The earnings of Northwest for the third week in January were $114,000, a decrease of $45,000. Vice-president Hyke says the heavy snows obstructed the traffic and the severe cold caused blockades and loss of business. The closing prices, compared with those of yesterday, show an advance of 1/2 percent on Western Union, Jersey Central, Union Pacific, Kansas & Texas and Pullman Car Co., 1 on Lake Shore, 1/4 on Northwest preferred and Northern Pacific common, 1 on Omaha common, 1/4 on Missouri Pacific and Chicago, B. & Q., 1 on Illinois Central and West Shore Bonds, 1 on Manitoba, 1/2 on Lackawanna and Delaware & Hudson, Central Pacific closed 1 percent lower.

Local markets: The money market presents no new feature, the position continuing one of dullness and ease. Commercial paper is discounted at 7 percent, and loans on stocks made at 4 percent. Sterling exchange is steady at 84 3/8 premium for 60-day bills, 1/2 premium for demand bills between banks; counter rates 1/4 higher. Drafts on New York range from par to 1/8 premium. The stock market continues to be absolutely void of interest. Neither investors nor speculators are operating at the moment, and as a consequence prices are for the most part nominal, such fluctuations as occur from day to day scarcely covering the commission on a transaction. On the whole the tone was steady to firm this morning. Bank of Montreal fell off 1/4 percent, to 18 1/4 for buyers, 18 9/10 for sellers, merchants ruled steady at 110 1/4 and 111. Commerce moved up 1/4 percent, to 118 bid, 119 asked at the close. Ontario, after selling at 107 1/4, closed with buyers at 107. Telegraph was up 1/4 percent, to 116 bid in the early dealings, but at the close the stock was offered at this figure, and asked for at 116 1/4. Richelieu Navigation Company inactive and unchanged at 68 and 69, City Gas Company quiet and steady at 182 and 183. Canadian Pacific was firmer in sympathy with the New York and London markets, advancing 1/8 percent, to 41 bid, 41 1/4 asked. The transactions were: 100 shares Bank of Montreal at 189, 100 at 188 1/4, 50 Ontario at 107, 50 at 107 1/4, Merchants at 110, Commerce at 118, Canadian Pacific at 41.

It amuses one to hear Canada described as an Arctic region by American newspapers, which seem to forget that a large portion of the United States has a climate very similar to that which sometimes holds high carnival in the Dominion. Iowa is as cold as Ontario; so is Michigan and Wisconsin. Minnesota discounts Quebec, and Illinois and Nebraska are not as salubrious as New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The effects produced by the respective climates of Dakota and Manitoba are much the same, and as for Montana and Oregon, the snowfall in either is generally heavier than in the British possessions to the north. The Arctic regions of the United States really comprise the most progressive and healthiest portion of the Union. Arctic Canada is also healthy and progressive, and it is not too cold to live in as many wealthy Americans have recently found out. Canadian-American, The field for intelligent and skilled labor in this country is large and poorly supplied, while that for accomplished imbeciles is small and terribly overstocked. San Antonio (Texas) Light, SPORTS AND PASTIMES, The residents of St. George will hold a meeting on Sunday next for the purpose of organizing a snowshoe club. The St. George snowshoe club tramped across the mountain trails during the recent carnival. Considering the hard work put in by the boys during the carnival, the muster was very good, upwards of sixty turning out. A number of American cousins, guests of the Windsor, were present, and entered heartily into all that was going on. The famous horseman, Fred Archer, was introduced to the club by the president, Mr. C. D. Monk, and was duly initiated into the mysteries of bouncing, which he acknowledged in a short and characteristic speech. He expressed himself so pleased with the manner in which he had been treated while in Canada that he has resolved to pay Montical and the St. George's club a visit next winter. During the evening the president announced that the club steeplechase would come off next Tuesday. He thanked the members for the support afforded him during the past week, and also called for cheers for Messrs. KAVD TICKS WEST, J. E.

The farm house is just such a one as may be seen anywhere in England, with thatched roof and old-fashioned appearance. Great accuracy is shown in all the details and the figures are well drawn.

The safe of Dorais' hotel stolen intact - $300 and other valuables missing. Since the daring burglary at Lefebvre's Jewellery store scarcely a day has gone by without the announcement of some house or store being entered into and robbed, but it is questionable whether for boldness and originality a robbery which occurred at Dorais' well-known hotel, Longueuil, on Monday night, has ever been surpassed. Not only was the house successfully broken into, but the large safe weighing several hundred pounds was lifted bodily and carried nearly a mile from the house, broken open and finally left on the ice. The hotel had been closed, as usual, about midnight on Monday, when the householders had gone to bed and heard nothing during the night. When the stable man went to the house in the morning he found the back door broken open, the lock having been drilled and the bolts pushed back, an operation which must necessarily have taken considerable time. He at once gave the alarm, and roused the inmates, who shortly after wired the news to the Central police station, where a short time previous information had been received that a farmer from Pointe-aux-Trembles had reported at No. 11 station having his passage stopped by a large iron safe on the river road to Longueuil. Chief Detective Cullen and Acting Detective Proulx at once set off for Longueuil, which was in a state of great excitement over the affair. An inspection of the premises was then made. It was evident that the burglars had taken their time, for glasses and decanters were lying around in a state of great disorder. The safe seems to have been carried bodily from its place, as there were no marks of the castors along the floor as there would have been had it been moved in the usual way. This naturally led to the conclusion that there must have been a number of men engaged in the burglary. The detective afterwards proceeded with Mr. Dorais to the ice, where, about a mile from the hotel, just opposite the city limits, they found the safe battered about, as described by the farmer. The contents of the safe, consisting of upwards of $300 in cash, besides some notes and securities, were missing and the safe itself was smashed almost beyond recognition. Lying around the safe were found some sledgehammers and a number of other heavy tools, which, it was subsequently discovered, had been stolen from a blacksmith's shop at Hochelaga. The entire detective force was at once put on the affair, with the result that four men were arrested in the afternoon at 1504 St. Antoine street. The police are very reticent about the affair but it is understood they consider these arrests as important. The men arrested are alleged to have come from Toronto, and in one of their trunks, seized at the time of the arrest, was found a dynamite cartridge, eight inches long by one inch in diameter, and marked ""Hercules."" Montreal, February 3, The severe cold weather of the past two days has materially retarded trade at the grain market, and today the attendance of buyers and sellers is small, primarily owing to the above-mentioned reason. The offerings of produce, consequently, were considerably lighter than on Friday, and business generally was quiet. In grain, oats have advanced owing to the small supply. Flour and meal were quiet and in average request. Flour, 100 lbs, $5.00; wheat, $1.00; corn, $0.50; oats, $0.30; barley, $0.40; peas, $0.60; buckwheat, $0.50; flaxseed was quoted at $1.00 per bushel. Business in vegetables was slack owing to cold weather, which prevented many dealers from attending the market. Prices are steady, however, no change having occurred. Potatoes, 4 bags $1.40; cabbages, 4 dozen $1.30; scallions, dozen $0.50; Florida grapes, 4 brls $2.00; pineapples, 8 for $1.00; lemons, per case $4.00; oranges, per dozen $3.00; apples, brl $1.60 to $3.00; bananas, per bunch $0.50; beets, 4 bushel $0.90; celery, doz $0.40; Hubbard squash, each $0.75; Brussels sprouts, 4 boxes $1.60; rutabagas, 4 bushel $0.60; tomatoes, per box $0.00.",1,18850204,historical,cold,0,0,0,0,0,0,

COLD FEET MAY BE AVOIDED BY USING Ramsay's Boot Grease WATERPROOF LEATHER PRESERVATIVE KEEPS THE FEET DRY AND WARM. S McMclilan and a party on the island Mr. McMillan, with the fearless spirit of an eager sportsman, wished to leave for one of the other Islands at once, although the water was somewhat rough, but none of his party were willing to go. Turning to Mr. Sumner he asked him to go, and the young gentleman consented to do so. They were seen to reach an island above Dickinson, and to stay there for a short time. In the meantime, a heavy storm sprang up, and they were not soon seen. Mr. Sumner, however, spent all day Saturday looking for a clue as to the whereabouts of the unfortunate sportsmen. Several parties were also engaged in the search. Another of the boat, together with the stern sheet, have been found and identified by the owner as belonging to it. Mr. Sumner's coat and pants, together with a decoy duck, were found on the island, and one theory is that they must have shot some ducks and went out in the boat for them when it capsized. If the craft capsized, which seems to be the accepted theory, the two men could not long survive in the intensely cold water. It is further supposed that they would have had their cartridge belt on them and the weight of this with the heavy woolen clothing they wore at the time, would handicap them greatly in any effort to regain the shore by swimming. Storms are known to be of frequent occurrence on the lake, and even on Saturday, when the parties were engaged searching for the missing ones, a boat with three occupants came over from Hinkinson's island to the main shore and had a very narrow escape from being swamped. If the lake was calm yesterday it was intended to drag it near where the missing gentlemen were last seen, but up to last night no wind had been given as to whether it had been done or not. A relative of one of the gentlemen stated to a Gazette reporter last evening that he had given up all hope of the safety of the two gentlemen since Saturday. A Mr. Brown who was shooting on a part of the lake near where the gentlemen were last seen, stated that about the time they are supposed to have been lost, a strong gale blew over the lake. The water became very rough and Mr. Brown was saved only by getting his boat in among the rushes where he had to remain for some time before he could land. Mr. McMillan was formerly a member of the firm of McLichlan Bros. & Co., and was about 47 years of age. Mr. Sumner was 17 years of age, and was a very promising young man. In several of the churches of the city yesterday prayers were offered up that the Lord might comfort the afflicted families of the two gentlemen. SHARPE & McKINNON'S FAILURE.

President's position to one of immense power and responsibility, so that it is now one of the first importance on earth American diplomacy is guided by the President's decisions and affects all countries The President is now resolving the fisheries question with England, the Samoa question with Germany, the emigration question with China, and the consular rights question with Morocco He may

influence of the news of the German Emperor's improved condition and the absence of any further development of the Boulanger movement There was a strong demand for American railroad securities, both for the home and foreign account A comparatively small amount of American stocks and bonds is now held in Europe, but a large amount of European capital would be attracted to American interests on perceiving satisfactory indications of an improvement in American trade, which would be reflected in an advance of the value of railroad securities There are rumors that the tin syndicate has collapsed The present difference is 00 per ton for short and three months' delivery THE WEATHER AND CROPS The backwardness of the Spring further illustrated Washington, April 29 The following is the weather crop bulletin for the week ended Saturday, April 28: The average daily temperature for the week ended April 28 has ranged from three to six degrees lower than usual in the States on the Atlantic coast and it has been slightly warmer than usual in the Mississippi valley and then westward to the Pacific coast, the warmest region, where the daily excess of temperature ranged from two to five degrees above the normal being in Missouri and the adjoining States The season from January 1 to April 28 continues cold and backward throughout the Northern States, where the average daily temperature ranges from three to six degrees below the normal In the Upper Lake region, Minnesota, Dakota and Iowa, the season continues from two to three weeks late, while in the Ohio valley and on the Middle Atlantic coast it is from six to ten days late In the Southern States the season is well advanced and the average temperature differs but slightly from the normal The most marked feature in the rainfall for the week is the large deficiency which is reported in the winter wheat States of the Ohio and Central Mississippi Valleys At many stations within this region, extending northward to the Lake regions, no rain occurred, while very light showers are reported at other stations More than the usual amount of rainfall is reported from Texas, Colorado, Nebraska, Western Kansas, Minnesota, Western Iowa and Northern Wisconsin, and well-distributed showers occurred on the Gulf coast, in the Middle Atlantic States and in Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas Owing to the general deficiency of rain the weather of the week has affected growing crops unfavorably Rain is especially needed in the winter wheat sections and in the northern portions of the Gulf states Frosts occurred in Kentucky, Eastern Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and the middle Atlantic states during the week, which probably injured vegetables and fruits Reports from Kansas, Minnesota and Western Missouri indicate that the weather has been favorable in those sections and that farm work is well advanced The weather is reported as favorable for corn in New England where ploughing and planting are in progress A Jailer growing: Family The jailer of Napannee jail has a rather curious experience at present No less than two pair of twins being added to his jail family in one week Two women who

Default,301,"I'm little trouble! It is proverbially the one that can cause the most worry, annoyance and distraction. But what are sometimes considered little troubles, if left to themselves, can magnify into grave evils, producing disastrous results. This is especially true of a cold in the head. The sufferer looks upon it as a trifling annoyance that needs no treatment and will speedily pass away. This is a grave mistake. There is not a case of catarrh in existence that did not have its origin in a neglected cold in the head, and the longer the trouble runs the more serious the results. A cold in the head, developing into catarrh, renders the breath foul, causes a loss of the senses of taste and smell, partial deafness, distressing headaches, constant hawking and spitting, and in many, many cases ends in consumption and death. No one may have all the symptoms indicated, but the more the sufferer has the greater the danger. It is obvious, therefore, that no case of cold in the head should be neglected for an instant, and that to do so is courting further disease, perhaps death. Nasal Balm, in the most aggravated case of cold in the head, will give instant relief, and speedily effects a cure, thus preventing the developing of catarrh. No other remedy has ever met with the success that Nasal Balm has, and this is simply because it does all its manufacturers claim for it. As a precautionary remedy, a bottle of Nasal Balm should be kept in every house. Sold by all dealers. At a meeting of the committee appointed to act on behalf of the citizens of St John's, in relation to the question of French treaty rights in Newfoundland, held on the 15th of January, a resolution was unanimously adopted to the following effect: Resolved, that this meeting desires to express its grateful appreciation of the interest taken by our fellow-colonists of the Dominion of Canada, in our behalf, for their manifestations of sympathy with us in the hardships of our position, and for the active and valuable support afforded us by the various boards of trade, and other members of public opinion and sentiment throughout the Dominion; and the committee considers this sympathy and cooperation a source of strength and bond to secure the people of this colony to make their rightful effort in the future. THE MODERN TOURNAMENT. Long ago (so legends tell us) to uphold his lady's beauty many a knight at joust and tourney laid his trusty lance in rest; or in chivalrous compassion, as the soldier's dearest duty, championed first the fame and safety of some damsel distressed. Then the air grew faint and trembled to the shock of lances shivered, while the shouts of scorn or loud acclaims rose high and shook the land; and the guerdon of the victor was the damsel delivered, or the smile vouchsafed by beauty's queen as he knelt to touch her hand. Long ago? Not so. The ages, as they fling their shadows onward, bring but change to outward seeming, while the world remains the same; still the arm of flesh strikes fiercely, still the spirit struggles sunward; still we thrill to martial story, glory nobly and shrink from sting of shame. Still imperious duty claims us as her servant on life's journey, points the way with torch and finger on the slenderest march of truth; bids us buckle on our armor for that modern tilt and tourney where the lance is but a pencil and the lists a polling booth, while for queen of beauty, bending from her balcony embowered, or for love-lorn maidens' fortunes on the lances point that wields, see our country watching, trusting, while the sons whom she hath dowered with the power to make or mar her, hold the balance of her fate. Strong and proud she stands before them, their liege lady, queen and mother; on her brow the dawn of power, on her stalwart limbs no chain; shall they, sworn unto her service, draw the sword for any other? Oh, Canadians! free-born children! shall she watch and trust in vain? Will ye falter, faint and weary in the trial's stress of the morning? Barter birthright for a pottage that shall prove but bitter food? Peddle for silent alms, and shirk the work of brain and muscle, scorning to gain with toil and patience that which you have bought with blood? Do dishonor to the fathers' graves whose sacred names you cherish? Leave your sons a coward's heritage when ye yourselves are dust? God forbid! Not so have nations won the name that cannot perish, who have climbed, and fought, and striven to the watchwords, work and fruit. Up and gird you, sons of freemen, for the fight that lies before you, tip the lance with steel of honor, not with gold though burnished bright; with the emblems of your lady on your breast and waving o'er you, do your devoir bravely, purely, as did ever belted knight. Knights and champions are ye truly if ye fall, ye fall with glory, as the soldier in the inmost trench, truest hero when he dies; if ye win, your names are written in your country's annals' story as her saviors in her danger, and her highest good your prize.

Mr. Cotter this morning, on behalf of Mr. Penlston Starr, applied for an order to wind up the corporation of William Parks & Son (limited). Solicitor-General Pagsley, who appeared for the firm, requested an adjournment of the application, as he had not yet had an opportunity of consulting the directors in reference to the matter. Justice Palmer said that, while not wishing to be understood as having made up his mind in reference to the matter, he had been looking into the questions involved and his present opinion was that it would be preferable if this matter stood over till the hearing of the general case, when all parties interested would be given the fullest opportunity of presenting their various cases to the court. Another question which had presented itself to his mind was whether or not it would be proper during the pendency of the general suit to permit winding up proceedings, but he did not wish to be understood as giving this as his decided opinion in the matter. He would postpone the hearing on Mr. Coster's motion until Monday next. He Hit Xitnole Saw.

Meeting of the French Cabinet Regarding the Empress Frederick's Visit. Paris, February 25. The League of Patriots has violently denounced the visit of Empress Frederick of Germany to the palace of Versailles. The league has decided to hold daily meetings of protest until the Imperial visitor leaves the city. It is known here that in Berlin it was expected President Carnot would call on Empress Frederick, but after a special cabinet meeting had been held and the question had been fully discussed it was decided that, as Empress Frederick was travelling incognito, the French Government could compromise the matter by sending the chief of the present military household, General Bittiger, and M. Ribot, minister of foreign affairs, to call on the Empress. This was accordingly done, General Brugere and M. Ribot calling at the German embassy and inscribing their names in the visitors' book. This question of etiquette was undoubtedly the cause of much anxiety and worry to the members of the French cabinet and was made the subject of a long and earnest discussion before it was finally concluded that the Government could not dare to risk the verdict of public opinion if President Carnot called on the imperial visitor.",1,18910226,historical,cold,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Default,302,"J. Gilroy, auditors, W. Cluff and James Bissell. A vote of thanks was then tendered to the retiring president, which was carried by a standing vote. A speech supporting the motion was made by Mr. Derbyshire, who took occasion to refer to the interest that had been taken in the board by the Montreal Gazette. The reports in that newspaper had been very accurate and had done very much to bring the board into great prominence not only in Canada but elsewhere. There were offered on the board 772 boxes of cheese, mostly colored, of which 643 were sold, the range of prices being 10c to 10. The ruling price was 10 5/16c, which is 15/10c better than the ruling figures last year at the opening of the board. The run this year appears to be smaller than the average, but the quality, so far as is known, is better. No grass cheese can be expected until about three weeks from now, and even then the supply will be limited. H. Ridgdon's representative was the principal buyer and Ayer's man also got a few. THE STATE OF TRADE. The cold and unseasonable weather at the beginning of the week choked the movement of spring dry goods for the city and suburban trade. In the country, roads are still bad, and such farmers as can get to their fields are out working them, so that there is little business in consequence. Travellers, out on the tail end of a sorting-up trip, are only sending in small jobbing orders for immediate requirements. They have also got samples of early delivery fall goods, but are making very few sales. Remittances show a marked improvement and stocks are large and little broken both in wholesale and retail hands, for iron. There has been some more business doing but the increase was not very appreciable but the market has a firmer tendency as a whole, and perhaps some purchases which were made last week on a $19 basis could hardly be repeated now. In fact, an offer of over that for a fair sized lot was refused the other day. Summarizes rules steady, and $22 is the basis for it and equal bands for nearby delivery. Advices from primary markets continue strong in tenor, and warrants have not abated the strength they have displayed, while makers' brands are also firm, although the alteration in them for natural reasons is not so marked as that of warrants. Iron, Etc. There is a steady business to note at $2.10 for Canadian bar, while foreign remains in the same position. Hoops and bands show no change, and the same may be said of sheet iron. Foreign advices continue strong. Copper. The easy feeling in copper is maintained and although figures are nominally the same at 13c or thereabouts it is claimed that, as noted last week, more business has been done inside this price. Canadian Plates. Further business of a small kind is noticed in these and several orders of 50 and 100 box lots have been put through since our last in the basis noted last week, viz $3.00. The position of tin plate is unchanged and with little probability of any in the immediate future. Some stock arrived last week which was all covered by orders, and there is some nearby but its cost is greater than what stock ex-store could be moved for. Consequently holders are firm and those who can't hold off have to pay tin plate. Further business however is being done for summer delivery at the reduced prices which have already been mentioned.

The nail market is as mixed up as ever and all sorts of stories circulated. In view of them it is utterly impossible to quote a price, for some remarkable prices have been spoken of, as low as $2 being mentioned as a price from the mills, and one prominent jobber when spoken to about it said he was quite prepared to believe it, but that he was working on a $2.20 basis but was pretty well mixed up for all that.

Colonial wools are in good demand at firm prices. The topic of the wool market is steadily making more impression on yarns, and this week several spinners are announcing advanced prices. A good deal of business is still held in check by the cold weather. The cashmere hose trade is by far the most unsatisfactory department in hosiery, and the small demand on export account tends very much to aggravate the situation. Elastic web trade only moderate. Brunrono, April 23. Business in the wool market today is not animated, purchases in wool are made with some degree of caution, consumers having recently supplied their wants rather freely. The unabated dimness of staplers' prices tends to deter spinners from operating at present. Colonial wools are stiff in price in London, and a good business is doing in this market in both cross-breds and merino wools for immediate consumption. English wools, with the exception of lustre sorts, are in steady request at firm rates, a condition which it is said is likely to continue under the present limited supplies of wools in the market. Mohair and alpaca are slow of sale. Botany tops, not in active request. The yarn market is very quiet. Spinners are receiving a number of small orders in various classes of yarn, but the present quotations of spinners are not freely yielded by yarn merchants, who maintain these prices with firmness, to the evident detriment of demand. Though repeat orders are limited, particulars for late contracts are coming to hand rather freely, and spinners are generally well employed both for home and export. In the piece market a fair amount of business is doing for home, although there are complaints that the cold weather has a detrimental effect upon the demand for spring goods. There is a rather better demand for export, which includes some light business for the American market. LATEST TELEGRAPHIC MARKET. Toronto, May 7.

Twenty Thousand Armed Boers Preparing to March Northward. ANOTHER LITTLE WAR, In Which England Will Have Her Hand Full. The South African Treaty and Italy's African Policy. London, May 7. Replying to a question in the House of Commons today in regard to the reported Boer trek being prepared for the invasion of Mashonaland and other South African territory, for the purpose of establishing the so-called Republic of the North, Hon. Edward Stanhope, secretary of war, intimated that troops were being sent to British Bechuanaland in order to oppose the proposed Boer trek. Recent advices state that 20,000 well-armed Boers propose to cross the Limpopo in June and proclaim the Republic of the North. The leaders of the trek included men of position from both the Free States and Cape Colony and all steps taken are said to have met with the approval of the famous Afrikander Bund, recently in session at Kimberley. Object of the Movement. The Boer movement is a South African movement in the direction of northward expansion and is bound to conflict with the claims of the British Chartered Company, to say nothing of the claims of the Portuguese South African Company. One of the objects of the raid is said to be the replacement of the Chartered Company by a popular movement free from the Imperial Government's control. There is a strong feeling against the company and against Imperial control in South Africa. The leaders of the trek, however, say little or nothing about the Chartered Company, claiming to base their proceedings upon concessions granted long before the Chartered Company existed. The new republic will be founded on the constitutional laws of the South American Republic and is expected to attract men of high character and ability from all parts of South America. Another ""little war"" in South Africa seems to be threatened. It will require many more British troops than are now available to cope with the 20,000 Boers, who are dead shot and capable of suffering the most severe hardships without complaint. The Grip's Spread in England. LONDON, May 7. Influenza is steadily spreading throughout the country. Wherever the disease has appeared it has been abated in its ravages by a return of the cold winds. The Mayor of Sheffield has opened a fund for the purpose of procuring medicine for poor patients. Each of the large hospitals in London has an average of 100 cases of influenza. There are signs of a continued increase of the epidemic. Several more members of Parliament have been attacked. Six of the usual occupants of the Treasury bench were absent today. Prince Christian and Count Hatzfeldt, the German ambassador, were unable to attend a dinner given this evening. The Duchess of Marlborough, Justice Homer and a host of public officials are among those affected. German news. M. ordered at Malta. K. May 7. A sensation has been caused in the garrison here by the discovery that Colonel Prager has been murdered. The body of that officer was found this morning at his residence. His head had been smashed in with a hammer, which was found in the room covered with blood. The officer's throat had also been severely gashed with a knife or razor. The military and police authorities believe robbery was the motive of the crime. There is no clue to the murderer. Italy's African Policy. Rome, May 7. Signer Bovio, in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, made a motion that the Italian forces now in East Africa should be ordered to evacuate that territory. Bovio's motion was only supported by twenty-one extremists. Premier Badini led the House to endorse the African policy of the Government, which was agreed to, 190 to 38. At St. Petersburg. St. PETERSBURG, May 7. The author Mikhailovsky has been expelled from the city for acting as master of ceremonies at the funeral of Shelgunov, the political economist, on Saturday last, on which occasion the students of the University marched through the main thoroughfare in defiance of the order of the police. More Arrests in Rome. Rome, May 7. Additional arrests have been made of Anarchists concerned in the May Day riot here. The persons arrested today had in their possession a pamphlet issued by Malatesta, an Italian refugee in London, explaining the manufacture and use of bombs. Why End the Treaty at Any Time? Madrid, May 7. It is reported that the treaty of commerce between Spain and the United States contains no stipulation in regard to its duration, and therefore, the treaty may be renounced by either side upon due notice of such action being shown. Too Foggy to Land the Malta. Queenstown, May 7. Tugs report that the steamer Germanic, from New York, arrived in this port at 6 o'clock this morning, but owing to a heavy fog she decided not to attempt to land passengers or mails here, but to proceed to Liverpool.

The Canadian Pacific claims old rates, which are 13 cents lower per 100 lbs than those of the current year. The matter was finally referred to a committee, which is to report tomorrow.

The North-western Miller says: ""The flour output last week was 125,160 barrels. The heavy decline in wheat has made a fairly dead flour market. Prices are lower and unsettled. Yesterday's advance in wheat induced some inquiry for flour. The export trade is fully as dull as the domestic. The export shipments for the week were 56,950 barrels. Went Through a Trestle. Chicago, May 7. A freight train on the Western Indiana Belt line was descending a heavy grade on a trestle in this city today when the rail spread.

Default,303,"WAKEFIELD (WEDNESDAY) There was a very good attendance at this market and several later buyers from London, Birmingham, and other districts made extensive purchases trade ruled brisk; prices were somewhat higher, and a good clearance was effected. The show of beef was smaller than last week, 1,720 fat beasts being penned, against 1,830. Speaking generally, the quality of the animals was first class, though a few rough and heavy lots were on offer. Very choice and well-fed animals made 7d per lb, useful beef 6d, and heavy rough beasts 6d. There were 6,114 sheep, lambs, and calves, against 6,018 last week, or an increase of 1,106. Fortunately for the dealer there was a large attendance of buyers, and this enabled them to secure fully last Wednesday's prices, and in some cases a slight advance was obtained. Nearly all the sheep were there, and on the whole they were a creditable lot. The best small sheep in wool sold at 7d per lb and heavier sheep 6d to 8d. Clipped sheep sold at from 6d to 7d. Lambs were freely offered at about 1s per lb. About 170 milch and lean beasts were penned, but in consequence of the continued cold weather trade was quiet. Milch cows sold at 14 to 25 each, and lean beasts at 10 to 18. BRISTOL THURSDAY Beef comes to hand in moderate quantities and selling better at 64s to 66s per cwt for it M, and 60s others. A fair number of sheep, which sold at 8d to 9d per lb for choice wethers in the wool and 7d ewes. About 400 store cattle from Iceland, but only the better lots sold at late values. Short supply of pigs, which sold at 8s 4d to 8s 6d per score for bacon pigs to 8s to 9s for porkers. DOWN AT THE CITY HALL Cathedral Street Impropriation The Limits Objected to today. Cleaning. The commissioners in expropriation for the widening of Cathedral Street met yesterday morning and heard objections to the proposed limits. The principal objector was Mr. Jesse Joseph, who was backed up by a notarial protest. Mr. Joseph complained that properties half a mile away had been placed in the limits, while others one hundred and fifty feet away had been left out. Ex-Ald. Fairbairn also objected. The commissioners took the objections under deliberation. The Market committee was to have gone out to the Eastern abattoir yesterday morning to look at the site of the new cattle sheds, but Ald. Stephens drew their attention to the fact that it was useless to visit the place, as they had obtained plans for a $20,000 building and had only been granted $10,000. The committee thereupon postponed their visit until this morning, and appointed a sub-committee to confer with Messrs. Perrault & Menard, the architects. The Annexation committee meets on Saturday morning, when they will consider the Cubegonde petitions. Ald. Prefontalne says that the Street Railway committee will lay their rails to the tail race bridge. The Road department expects to begin work on the St. Catherine Street paving early this week.

Demand Lambs Demand Lambs Moving Slow The market for dressed beef is firmer in tone, and prices are a little higher than what they ruled at in the beginning of the season, which is due principally to the improved demand of late and the decided cold weather, coupled with the fact that the live stock market has been pretty well cleaned up of all the inferior cattle, and the prospects are now that the season will wind up much better than was anticipated a few weeks ago Hindquarters are selling at 5c to 7c per lb, and fronts at 3c to 4陆c The stock of dressed lambs here is large, there being fully 5,000 carcasses on this market for sale, for which the demand is very slow, as buyers generally have laid in their winter supplies, and as there is no outlet for them, all the American markets being well supplied, the indications are that a considerable number will be left over, and if the weather becomes mild, a sharp decline in prices may be looked for, but at present, small lots are selling at 4c per lb Mr EONSECOURS MARKET Attendance of Buyers and Sellers Very Small Business Slow Prices Unchanged At Bonsecours market this morning, business was very quiet in all lines of produce, in fact, the appearance of the market was dull The gathering of buyers was very small, which was no doubt due to the extreme cold weather, and no one came out of doors this morning, except those that were obliged to The attendance of farmers was very slim, there being only two or three loads of oats offered, which sold at 75c to 80c per bag The weather was too severe to induce gardeners to come to market, and in consequence, the offerings of vegetables were very small, outside of what were held by regular dealers, which were quite ample to fill all requirements and values show no chance The demand for fruit was slow, of which the assortment is small for this season of the year There was no change in poultry, prices being steady all round The supply was ample, but trade was slow Dairy produce was dull New laid eggs were steady at 25c to 30c per dozen In game, there was no change to note The fish market was quiet, notwithstanding the fact that the Lenten season commences tomorrow

Fair and moderately cold SIR CHARLES TUPPER, SR, Resumes His Seat In the House Grain Standards Board Georgian Bay Canal Minor Notes (From our own correspondent) Ottawa, February 18 The dreary Budget debate still drags its weary length along, and, from present appearances, and the number of speakers on both sides who are said to be ""loaded"" or to be ""loading"" for a ""great effort,"" it does not look as if the House will get into supply before Friday, if then It does not seem probable, however, that the debate can by any means be carried over to next week, so that the ""weirds, words, idle words,"" will, at the latest, cease their flow on Friday night The greater part of the afternoon was taken up by Mr Davin, who made a really excellent speech, very clearly and critically analyzing the Grit policy, as outlined in the celebrated resolutions adopted at the Ottawa Convention of 1863 Mr Davin very cleverly contrasted the different planks in the platform to show how ill they fitted together, and how contradictory and unworkable they were Mr Jumin followed for about three hours before and after recess, reading in a tiresomely slow, drawling fashion a carefully prepared speech, showing what a terribly mean thing it is to be a wicked, wicked Tory and believe in the National Policy When Mr Hum got through, about ten o'clock, Mr Henderson rose and made a good practical National Policy speech, from a farmer's standpoint Mr Henderson seldom addresses the House, but when he does his remarks command attention, as he is a practical farmer and thoroughly understands what he talks about, which is more than can be said for a great many gentlemen, who make long speeches Indeed, the riper some members know about a subject, the more they will talk about it Sir Charles Tupper When the House met, at 11:15 today, Sir Charles Tupper was in his seat, for the first time since his introduction, last Tuesday As a good many stories have been set afloat, in the Opposition papers, as to Sir Charles' health, based on his absence from the House, it may be as well to state that there was not anything serious the matter with Sir Charles, whose general health is excellent As everybody knows, he contracted a heavy cold during the Cape Breton campaign, and suffered a good deal from hoarseness For the treatment of this hoarseness, his throat was being sprayed, and the fumes of the drugs used affected his eyes, so as to bring on inflammation which necessitated his remaining at home for a few days and avoiding the light At the same time, he has been transacting business and receiving deputations at home every day This morning he was at his office, took his lunch at the Commons' restaurant, and was in the House all the afternoon The rest he has had seems to have done him a world of good, and, as said above, his general health is excellent The Grain Standards A deputation interviewed several members of the Government today, on the subject of the grain standards The Toronto Board of Trade was represented by Mr Chapman, the Toronto Grain Exchange by Mr Northamptonshire Stakes, one and a half miles and 200 yards, April 2 Sir Excess, 12陆 lb Abraham Plate, one mile and two furlongs, April 15 Sir Excess, 12陆 lb Great Surrey Handicap, five furlongs, April 21 Americus, 11陆 lb City and Suburban, one and a quarter mile, April 22 Montauk, 10 lb Chester Cup, two and a quarter miles, May 6 Santa Anita, 120 lb Kompton Park Great Jubilee Stakes, one mile, May 9 Americus, 108 lb; Sir Excess, 111 lb Banquet II, the old American favorite, is among the acceptances for the Great Metropolitan, two and a quarter miles, to be run April 21, at 121 pounds It is evident that Mr Croker relies upon Americus and Eau Caille in races of one mile and under, while Sir Excess will be used in races of one and a quarter miles and under, and Santa Anita will be the mainstay of the stable in races of one mile and a quarter, and at cup distances Mr Croker's placing of the horses agrees with the American estimate of their capabilities in the races of Sir Excess, Americus and Santa Anita Should Santa Anita start in the Ascot Gold Cup, the impost will be 130 pounds Should the trio be fully acclimated by the dates of the spring handicaps, they should have, at least, an outside chance, despite the steadying weights Santa Anita is a notoriously hard horse to train, while Americus and Sir Excess are apt to be retarded by climatic influences Foxhall was in England from his two-year-old days, and, therefore, fully acclimated when he made his fame in the Cambridgeshire and Chester Cup At their best, it is doubtful if the three in question are in Foxhall's class, although the weights indicate that the English handicappers are taking no chances about them According to the English turf journals, the Kempton Jubilee is the most attractive of the spring handicaps In his summary, the special commissioner of the London Sporting Life states: ""Either Victor Wild or Clorane should give the weight to Whittier, even if the latter's temper is to be trusted; while, if choosing from Reminder, Worcester, Kirkconnel and Red Heart, who range in this order from 8 stone 5 pounds to 8 stone 1 pound, I should be inclined to take the last named, who, if some of his efforts last season were disappointing, did a few brilliant things"" Whether the Kempton Jubilee or the City and Suburban attract Red Heart, he may be expected to run a good horse this spring It would, however, serve to no purpose to analyze a handicap field for such a far-off date as May the 5th, so I merely call attention to Clorane, Red Heart, Lesterlin, The Lombard, and Court Pall and Dornroschen, the latter pair being specially attractive The full conditions and list of acceptances for the Jubilee are as follows In calculating the weights, a stone should be taken as fourteen pounds Kempton Park Great Jubilee Stakes of 3,000 sovereigns; Jubilee course; one mile; run daily May 5 Also, E. Leblanc, speaker of the Legislative Assembly, went to interview Mr Henry Holgate, Manager of the Park & Island Railway Company, and urged upon him the opportunity of building an electric railway to St. Rose Hon Mr Leblanc explained all the good that such a road would render the locality in particular and to the County of Laval in general Mr Holgate promised the delegation that the matter would be seriously considered by the Board of the Montreal Park & Island Railway Company, which would meet in the course of a day or two This Company's service has been noted for its regularity; even during the severe snowstorms of the past few days, the traffic has not been interrupted and the cars have run on schedule time Funeral of Mr Donald Campbell The funeral of the late Mr Donald Campbell, of St. Hilaire, took place yesterday The remains were conveyed by special train from St. Hilaire to Chambly, where the service and interment were held The little church at Chambly, in spite of the cold weather, was well filled by the deceased's many friends from St. Hilaire, St. Hyacinthe, Chambly and Montreal Among those present from Montreal were Mr Henri Hontliilier, Mr Leopold Calameau, Messrs Holland, Dr Charles McKauhran, Mr Y Shelton having left a widow, it does not lessen the number of annuities to be paid from this fund, but it lessens the amount to be paid yearly by a considerable sum Chinamen for Cuba There was quite an interesting scene in the Windsor Depot yesterday afternoon at five o'clock, when the western train from Vancouver had, in addition to the usual passengers, sixty-three Chinamen, en route for different cities in the United States and for Havana The party were much above the usual close of celestials we get here, and were clean and quite intelligent looking, which is also unusual They evidently felt the cold very keenly, and appeared in a shivering condition They were laden with all kinds of extraordinary articles made of straw and matting Sang Koo and several of his friends were in waiting for the party, and those who stayed overnight in the city were lodgers at his establishment The party is divided into two sections One consisting of thirty-eight are on their way to Havana, and go by way of New York tomorrow The others, twenty-five in number, are in bond, and are destined for New York, Boston, Chicago and Baltimore",1,18960219,historical,cold,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Default,305,"I'M, August 5 Full details are published of the adventurous voyage of Harbo and Hsmnelsen in the row boat Fox, which reached Scilly last Saturday. Harbo reports that they left New York at 5 p.m., June 6th, and proceeded under oar with variable weather until June 18th, when they sighted the North German Lloyd steamer Pruitt Bismarck, bound to New York, the master of which vessel offered to take them back again, but they declined. Owing to strong winds they were driven northward to the Banks of Newfoundland, and July 1st they spoke the schooner Leader and requested the master to report them all well. July 7th they encountered a heavy gale from the west, and had great difficulty in keeping the boat free, the sea continually breaking on board, keeping one of them bailing. The gale continued with more or less force until 9 p.m. of July 10th, when a heavy sea struck and capsized the Fox, throwing them into the water. After a few minutes they succeeded in righting her and getting on board and bailing her out. All their provisions, anchor, cooking utensils, signal lights, and several other articles which were not lashed to the boat were lost. After the accident they suffered severely from the cold. Shortly afterward the weather moderated, and the wind continuing fair they proceeded eastward. On July 15th they boarded the Norwegian barque Gito, from Quebec for Pembroke, and were supplied with water and provisions, and again, when about 400 miles west of Scilly, on July 24th, they spoke the Norwegian barque Eugene, from Halifax for Swansea, and obtained from her a small supply of bread and water. Both men are in good health, and look weather-beaten by long exposure. They pulled two pairs of sculls during the day, and at night kept watch of 31 hours' interval, one man pulling while the other man slept. S.

LONDON, August 5 - The Stock market today was lifeless and featureless. The position in America, and the weakness of the Paris Bourse, dominated all the speculative markets. Gold was in strong demand for the Continent. An increased supply of American bills is offering here, but they are not at present traceable to the special syndicate operations.

PARTICULARS OF THE WRECK The Simcoe left Chicago for Collingwood at 12:15 a.m. on November 19th, and had favorable but cold weather down the west shore of Lake Michigan, and was off Twin River Points at 11 a.m., steering northeast for the Manitous; on Saturday morning a heavy westerly gale with snow set in: the harbor of South Manitous was reached at 11:30 a.m., where the steamer wooded, and lay until midnight on Monday. On Tuesday, the 23rd, they had a smooth run through the Straits, and passed Cheboygan at 3:35 p.m. with a gentle wind from the south. At midnight the wind was south and the lake was not rough, the steamer going on her course in good shape. On Wednesday, at 2 a.m., the Duck Island light was passed, the usual distance off. At 4 a.m. there was a brisk south wind, with the sea rising and the steamer steering badly. At 7 a.m. the anchor shutters were broken down and driven in, and the midship gangway on the weather side burst. A gangway plank was placed across and lashed, but the sea was continually driving in, and the decks were constantly flooded. They then altered the steamer's course to leeward, and for a time she went better. They next commenced to lighten the steamer of her deck load, and had all the pumps at work to keep the water under. At 8 a.m. the decks were deluged with water, the steamer lurching heavily, and making water fast, caused by the seas washing over her decks. At 9 a.m. the fires were out and the engine stopped. The foresails set were next carried away. The crew were still manfully working the pumps and throwing the deck cargo overboard, and worked faithfully until the steamer commenced to founder at 10:40 a.m. All hands were then ordered to reach the boats, Captain Hill and the rest of the crew making for the lifeboat, but they did not get it free before the steamer went down stern foremost. The upper deck and pilot house floated, but were instantly broken into small fragments. The mate, engineer and one wheelsman succeeded in freeing and entering the two yawls, but were unable to get the boats clear of the wreckage in time to rescue the others struggling in the water. One fireman and a deck hand were within reach, and were drawn to the boat by lines thrown to them, and rescued. After getting the boats clear of the wreckage, it was impossible to row against the wind and sea, and the boat drifted faster than the wreck. Those in the boat manfully tried to row up to those still clinging to the want and other pieces of wreckage, and untiringly battled against wind and sea for one hour, when all hopes were given up, the last of their brave but unfortunate shipmates having disappeared in the soothing waters of the lake. With heavy hearts the rescued few commenced rowing for shore, some fifteen miles distant, arriving at Providence Bay at dusk, in an exhausted state. The inuring they endured must have been terrible, as their tale raises. London, November 30. In the case of the Rev.",1,18801201,historical,deluge,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Default,309,"REPUBLICANS ALARMED Hint the President will take them at their word and enforce the Retaliation Bill Wasiiington, August 9 In the Senate today Mr Evarts resumed his argument against the fisheries treaty The position which should be taken by the United States was, he said, to insist that the United States had always rejected the headland theory, and did not tolerate the claim of right on the part of Great Britain to make a bay by calling it a bay, and to shut out of it American fishermen; and then there might or there might not be an opportunity to find out what Great Britain meant That would not mean war or fear of war As to the complaint made on the Democratic side that publicity was given to the discussion of the treaty, Mr Evarts said that the initiation of such publicity was due to the Executive in recommending the treaty and all communications connected with it to be given to the public As to the complaint made by the senator from Alabama (Mr Morgan) against the majority of the Committee on Foreign Relations, for stating in its report that the time for negotiations had passed, Mr Evarts read the extract in question which reads: ""On the 19th of January, 1887, Congress came to the conclusion that the period of negation and unavailing remonstrance had passed"" So that it was Congress itself, he said, and not the committee which had come to that conclusion As to the same senator's charge of servility against the committee, Mr Evarts failed to find anything offensive or servile in the paragraph referred to In conclusion he said that he would prepare a comment upon the terms of the treaty itself and he hoped not an unfair one, but he would forbear to proceed with it at present President Grant's Policy Mr Evarts ceased speaking at half past three and then the discussion turning on President Grant's message to the Senate with a proposed treaty on the same subject was taken up by Mr Morgan, who declared that the President had on that occasion given counsel in favor of a true and wise policy, and now spoke from his grave better than any senator had done on this discussion Frye Wants Frozen Fish Timed Mr Frye represented the manner in which the payment of duties on preserved fish is evaded, that is by having the fish frozen solid and introduced duty free as fresh fish for immediate consumption While in fact such frozen fish could be kept for months He argued that a construction should be placed by Congress upon that provision of the law or else that a duty should be imposed on fish preserved by freezing, just as if it was preserved in any other way Making Campaign Capital Mr Morgan said that the object of destroying the treaty at once was nothing more nor less than political and was connected with the presidential election One of the senators from Massachusetts had pronounced him (Mr Morgan) a silly man because he had alluded to the fact that war might grow out of the question He might be silly, but he had seen enough of war to be afraid of it; perhaps the Senator from Massachusetts had not The President and Retaliation Mr Hoar disclaimed having spoken of the senator from Alabama as silly What he had said was that if he had not so much respect for that senator he should pronounce the suggestion that war with England might grow out of insisting on the rights of American fishermen as supremely silly Mr Morgan said that the Democratic party had in it the backbone of Andrew Jackson, that it was not going to make a foolish quarrel, but that if the quarrel came it would stand by the country right or wrong When this negotiation would fail then the Democrats meant, as the President meant, that the retaliation act, which then and not before would become mandatory, would be obeyed, and yet, when it was expected that that law was to be obeyed there came a howl from the Fishery association because the President would not pledge himself in advance to limit the retaliation to the fishery business Afraid of Their Own Creation Mr Blair, whose resolution had been alluded to by Mr Morgan, declared sarcastically that if there was to be no war with England or Canada until the discussion on the treaty ended war would be postponed until the destruction of the world by fire or till a deluge came again He supposed that the object of the senator from Alabama in talking war was for effect on the political campaign at home He did not know of any Republican who talked about war as a result of the rejection of the treaty The resources of diplomacy were all open and had not yet been exhausted A recalcitrant, obstinate and pigheaded executive was not going to take the responsibility of inflicting on the American people needless injury, mercantile distress and the destruction of business unnecessarily and simply because he had the power When it was intimated to the Senate that the President was going further and would destroy the industrial fabric of the United States simply because he and his party were in a pout, it appeared to him (Blair) that the whole party might as well be banished from the country as being too ignorant, too foolish or too unpatriotic to exist properly under the protection of American laws Mr Hale criticized Mr Morgan's position and that of the Democratic party on the treaty as being in the interest of free trade There was no demand in any American quarter for free fish It was only within the last year that an American administration was to be found that was willing to trample American interests under its feet and to make long homilies and have its friends in the Senate make long speeches in favor of ""our enemies, the British people"" He congratulated the country on having seen in this debate what the animus of the Senator from Alabama was Compliments Exchanged Mr Morgan denied that he had made any statement to his desire or expectation to repeal the duty on salt fish, nor had he intimated that in consideration of the tariff bill soon to be entered upon he or any senator on his side proposed to make such a motion Proceeding to pay his compliments to Mr Blair, he said the country would not go to that school to learn lessons of wisdom and would not receive instructions from a senator who had talked such a batch of nonsense as that senator had talked this evening What credit could the British Government give to that set of resolutions or to the American Senate, in which they had been offered and debated, except to say that the senator from New Hampshire did not know what he was talking about and that his party was not responsible for what he said The senator had spoken of President Cleveland as pigheaded Mr Cleveland was not pigheaded and was not a fool He had been wise enough to best the Republican party every time he came in contact with it and he was going to do it again so easily that the Republicans would not know how it happened Mr Cleveland was the truest representative of American character that stood on the continent and the people knew it and intended to sustain him Mr Blair said that he had used the unfortunate adjective ""pigheaded"" in reference to the President's anticipated conduct as foretold and proclaimed by the senator from Alabama He had no wish to qualify the expression, he did not want to interfere with the senator's adoration That senator was at liberty to worship any fetish he chose, and would naturally select such a god After some further interchange of like compliments between the two senators, the two days' discussion came to a close, and the Senate at four o'clock adjourned",1,18880810,historical,deluge,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Default,311,"M. Brewer, of Charlottetown, IMS, preached both morning and evening. In the morning he took for his text: ""Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts."" He showed that his message to the Hebrew Prince was applicable to the evangelization of the world. Physical force was the lowest form of power, and in all countries it was superseded by intellect and later by moral powers. The speaker held that the time was coming when men would select the holiest man for a place of power and trust. There was a higher power in nature. Where men and horses were formerly used to convey news, we now use the telegraph and the telephone, but the network of wires over our country would be of no use if the electric current were withdrawn, so in the church all our efforts would be unavailing if not directed by the Spirit of God. God sometimes used physical means to show His power. The deluge brought men to their senses, and He drowned Pharaoh to make way for the escape of His people. But after all, there came the still small voice, mind speaking to mind, and this was the crowning means by which He would save the world. Men were to be reached through their hearts and consciences, and what was wanted was soul-saving power from on high. It was not the wise men of Athens or Rome that He sent to evangelize the world but fishermen from Galilee. In the 15th century, the son of a poor miner of Saxony, Martin Luther shook the foundations of Rome, and in the present day the great missionaries were such men as Carey, a shoemaker, and David Livingstone, a poor factory boy. It was to be regretted that man had tried persecution as a means of spreading the gospel, and it was the preacher's opinion that missions and churches were of no avail unless moved by God's omnipotent Spirit.",1,18900120,historical,deluge,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Default,312,"THE GAZETTE MONTREAL WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 3 1891 EMOTIONAL LITERATURE, Section Place of Geology and History, Since his retirement from the position with which his name will ever be honorably associated, Sir William Dawson has not been idle. This is the third work that has left his hands in little more than a twelve month. The subject of it is of intense interest not only to men of science, but to all intelligent students of the origin and destinies of the human race. It is not the first time that the illustrious author has undertaken to elucidate it out of the fullness of his knowledge of the early earth and the embalmed relics of its prime. Though, from the historian's standpoint, it was a young world on which human feet first trod, it was, as the geologist views it, so hoary with age that imagination recoils, aghast before the reckoning. The poets feigned a Saturnian age to picture the simplicity, kindliness and content of that youthful mundi, and, as Saturn was the Greek Cronos, whom some deem akin with Chronos (Father Time), who again was fabled to devour his own children, they were, in a sense, wiser than they knew. Happily, this monstrous parent has not destroyed all his offspring of every generation, geologic as well as human; vestiges enough have escaped his maw to yield at least the outline of a biography, if only they could be found, discriminated and interpreted. To the uninitiated the sibylline leaves of rocky evidence, displaced and twisted and even torn into fragments to be scattered far apart, still seem chaotic and meaningless, and we can hardly wonder that to many long centuries passed away, yielding only vague and often misleading guesses, before the key to the mystery was found, and the riddle of the rocks was read. It would be bad for us, doubtless, if there were no enigmas to occupy the human mind. At any rate, there is still ample scope for enquiry, and men like Sir William Dawson, who have spent decades and scores of years in the effort to decipher the hieroglyphics in which the earth has written her autobiography, feel no abatement of interest in the quest, how many soever be the triumphs they have won. The title of the volume under consideration, ""The Meeting Place of Geology and History,"" invites our attention to the birth, cradling and childhood of our race. The object of this little book, says the author, is to give a clear and accurate statement of facts bearing on the character of the debatable ground intervening between the later part of the geological record and the beginning of sacred and secular history. In some of his previous works, Sir William Dawson has dealt with the origin and course of non-human life, and he has also dealt largely and lucidly with the beginnings of human history. We are not unprepared, therefore, for his treatment of a subject that has long been congenial to him. We have now, he says, very complete data for tracing the earth from its original formless or chaotic state through a number of formative and preparatory stages up to its modern condition; but, perhaps, the parts of its history least clearly known, especially to general readers, are those which relate to the beginning and the end of the creative work. In the early stages the monuments are obscure; in the later, they are few, and those few complicated with modern changes under human influence. There are, however, notwithstanding obvious difficulties, facts enough to link the human period to the period that preceded it. The author defines the two latest of the geologic periods as the Pleistocene and the Anthropozoic, the latter being again divided into ""early modern or Pal忙ozoic, sometimes called Quaternary, or post-glacial,"" and the ""Neanthropic"" extending onward to the present time. The Pal忙oanthropic, in Sir William Dawson's opinion, may coincide with ""the ante-diluvian period of human history."" Having promised so much, the author goes on to describe the world before man, a scale of twenty inches being taken to represent the twenty million years of the earth's history, that of man would be indicated by a thickish line at one end of the scale. As to man's age, it is well established that he was already in Europe immediately after the close of the glacial period, and contemporary with the formidable faunas of animals then occupying the land. Pal忙oanthropic man, with his industries and arts, is then described, the contents of caves and other finds being adduced as evidence for his condition. The author also gives vitality to the ante-diluvian genealogies and shows the relations of the early Pal忙oanthropic races to those that followed them. Several chapters are devoted to the Deluge, and the author endeavors by the aid of natural science to remove certain doubts that have been cast on the ancient biblical records. The Toldoth or generations of the sons of Noah are discussed as the grand work of ethnographical knowledge, and their value is proved by the results of recent exploration.",1,18941003,historical,deluge,0,0,0,0,0,0,

When the Sherbrooke Juniors arrived at Angus there was scarcely a junior amongst them, but they were composed of Senior league men and other crack players not of Sherbrooke, with a few junior men intermingled for appearance sake. A written protest was at once served, and the Angus boys, not to disappoint the large crowd that were patiently waiting in the pouring rain, consented to play; and after the whistle blew the Angus scored the first three games in quick time. The rain now came down in a deluge, completely destroying the Angus team sticks, which were of a very inferior quality, becoming no better than shinny sticks. The Angus team, knowing it was no game, simply quit playing, some of the players having left us as soon as the Angus had scored the foul in the game, which the Sherbrooke umpire did not allow, because he was under an umbrella and could not say positively if it was a score or not.

Default,314,"U should arrange as soon as possible for that team to play the winners of the Ontario intermediate championship for Canadian championship, Princeton, 12; Harvard, 4, Princeton, November 2, The day for the great football contest between Harvard and Princeton opened with a grey lowering sky which threatened to deluge the field with torrents of rain. In spite of the unfavorable condition of the weather, lovers of the game came pouring into town all morning and the seats surrounding the gridiron contained 8,000 spectators when the Princetons came on the field at 2 o'clock. The interval before play began was occupied by the cheering of the supporters of the two teams. Four hundred Princeton men occupied stand ""D"" on the west side of the field, and they came out to cheer and sing till their voices should give way if necessary. Banners and flags of orange and black, or of crimson, were waving on all stands. Alumni, as well as the undergraduates, were on hand and proved that they had not forgotten their college cheers. Large numbers of pretty girls carrying streamers of the colors of their favorite colleges braved the inclement weather to see the great struggle. The weather finally turned out better than had been feared, and although it drizzled continually, it did not materially affect the game or the spectators, except that a great deal of slipping on the part of the players can be laid to the soggy condition of the ground. Early this morning the Harvard men displayed considerable confidence in their team by placing bets at odds of 2 to 1 against Princeton, but along towards noon it was not possible for Princeton to get more than even money. Almost from the moment the ball was put in play, it was evident that neither team was going to have a walkover. All through the first part of the game, Harvard had a little the best of it, although neither side was able to score. Harvard's line was much weaker than Princeton's, but this defect was made up for by the work of the backs. Charley Brewer and Wrightington were doing great work for Harvard, but their efforts were of little avail against Princeton's line. However, when the ball was passed to Brewer for a kick during the first half, he was able to send it down toward Princeton's goal line for greater distance than Baird was usually able to cover by his return; but Baird's improvement during the second half was simply wonderful, making a number of punts of from 60 to 80 yards. His work in the game will put him among the best full backs of the country. He only tried one drop kick for goal, but cannot be greatly blamed for failing considering the condition of the field and ball. It was decidedly a kicking game, the oval flying from one end of the field to the other. Both teams made their best gains by mass play directed against tackle or guard. Very little end running was attempted by either side. Princeton's line outplayed Harvard's at almost every point with the exception of left end. It is difficult to pick particular flaws in the Harvard work, but their line lacked that alertness and snap which cannot be dispensed with in a winning team. Capt. Lea broke his collarbone at about the middle of the second half, and from this point on Cochran captained the Tigers and showed himself very capable in this position. He handled his men well, and only once did he order a play which would have been better omitted. Score: Princeton, 12; Harvard, 4. Time, two 30-minute halves. Touchdowns Princeton, Rosengarten, Hunnard, and Hunter; Harvard, Shaw. No goals. Referee Pratt. Umpires Dashiel, of Lehigh, and Townsend, of Lehigh.

Varsity defeated Queen's in the first match of the Ontario Rugby Union final round at Rosedale today by 10 points to 2. The halftime score was Queen's 2; Varsity 1. The game was played in perfect weather, with about 3,000 spectators present. Varsity won the toss and decided to kick with the sun behind them and give the visitors the slight advantage of a southeast breeze. Varsity surprised its supporters by stopping Queen's rushes at the outset, and for fifteen minutes play was near midfield. The local men gained ground by picking out of scrimmage, free kicks for Queen's landing the ball near the line. Curtis made his mark and played for McRae, who missed the goal, but it was a rouge. Curtis soon kicked to touch in goal and the visitors led from 2 to 0, this proving their last point. Varsity's first came from Counsell's punt, McRae touching down. In the second half, the visitors were easily outplayed. Counsell started to punt with effect, soon forced a rouge, and the score was 2 all. The next was Bradley's try, the forwards rushing the ball over; no goal. Counsell punted to touch in goal and in short order Harr scored a try and Elliott kicked the goal. Queen's braced up and had a look in. They looked dangerous, but Belanger saved miraculously. Hobbs had his chest seriously hurt and went off with Elliott. Just before the whistle blew, Isarr followed up Kingstem's punt and fell on the ball for a try. Elliott kicked the difficult goal. Next Saturday the teams meet in Kingston to decide the championship, Varsity having 17 points advantage. Lorne 31; Osgoode 10, Toronto, November 2. It was 3 o'clock when the Lorne and Osgoode elevens met to play the final match in the intermediate series. At halftime, the score stood 7 to 5 in favor of the Lornes. Captain Kby was given the choice on account of the Osgoode team being late. The game was not a good exhibition of Rugby, and there were not many brilliant plays on the part of either team. For the Lornes, Flood, Charles Meek, and Reid played a good game, and White, Osier, and Robertson for Osgoode. In the second half, the Lornes rushed the play from the commencement and scored 21 to Osgoode's 5. Thus the Lornes won by 31 to 10. Hamilton Junior, 28; Granites, 7, Hamilton, November 2. The deciding game in the Rugby Junior championship series was played at the cricket grounds this afternoon before a good-sized crowd. The weather was cool and clear. The Hamilton Junior team and the Granites, of Kingston, were the opposing teams, and the fifteen players on each team had made declarations that they were under age and were qualified to play in the junior series. The contest was rather one-sided to be interesting, the home team playing all around the visitors and outplaying them at all points. In the first half, the Granites scored 3 points to Hamilton's 8, and in the last half, the visitors scored only 4 points while the Hamilton lads put together 10. The Hamilton Juniors thus won the match, 28 to 7, and secured the Junior championship cup. Other Matches, West Point, November 2, Yale, 28; Cadets, 8, Essex, Ont., November 2.

Ottawas are Displeased, Ottawa, November (Special) - The news of the Quebec Rugby executive's decision regarding the fixtures for future matches made necessary by the defeat of Montreal by McGill was received here with general surprise, as it was surmised that this city, in the event of a three-cornered fight, would get at least one of the games. Feeling over the matter runs pretty high in view of the fact that Montreal has voted itself practically three more games this season. People here, and lovers of football particularly, regard the treatment meted out to Ottawa as harsh, because they have already traveled twice to the metropolis this season. These same people attribute the action to the desire of Montrealers to gobble up all the good things that come along, and to forget in their strength the claims of other places to some recognition. An Important Meeting: Tonight, the committee of the Montreal Football Club are calling a meeting of the players and men interested in the game to meet at the Gymnasium tonight (Monday).

Default,315,"Whitfield Mills of his journey across the centre of the continent, from Belvano to Northampton in Western Australia, illustrates the hardships and perils to which explorers are oftentimes exposed. He must have undertaken his trip after a prolonged drought, for spots which preceding explorers had reported as furnishing good supplies of water he found to be quite dry. His travels covered a distance of 1,000 miles, and all along the route there are only three sources of water to be relied upon in a dry season as affording a permanent supply. Mr. Mills passed over some well-grassed and splendid salt-bush country, and speaking of an extensive desert of spinifex between the Warburton Range and the Lilyth Watershed, he says if the spinifex were replaced with grass, which it would if the spinifex were burnt, it would form for a considerable distance one of the most magnificent pastoral districts in the world. But all this was of little avail in the absence of water. The constant record is of dry creeks, dry lagoons, and dry rockholes; the camels had one drink in twenty-one days, and they tottered along, staggering against the trees, too thirsty to eat. With these ships of the desert, however, they were able successfully to cope with all the difficulties which had been brought about by a period of unusual drought, and which they never dreamt they would have to encounter.",1,18840331,historical,drought,0,0,0,0,0,0,

The Montreal Field Battery were practising with the Morris tube set to a 60 pounder. The range was supposed to be 1,500 yards. Lieut-Col. Stevenson explained the working of the tube. The Colonel first made a magpie; Lieut. Hooper followed with a shot which although in line was four inches above the target. Lieut. Lingua was one inch nearer the bull's eye than his colonel, when Sergeant-Major Walker almost touched the black bull's eye. The shooting which followed was very good indeed for a first attempt. This is supposed to be splendid practice for the battery, before they go to Kingston in September. To Notify the Public: To counteract the misleading statement made as to the effects of the so-called drought this season in the Northwest, the Canadian Pacific Railway are making a larger exhibit than usual of Northwest products at the approaching exhibition at Toronto, and they will also send their exhibition car to Ottawa, Sherbrooke, Hyacinth, and as many other places as possible, containing products of this season's crop, all of which give the most convincing proof that a soil which can give such a yield in an uncommonly dry season is just the soil which farmers who wish to have a good recompense for their labor should work in. This mode of giving publicity to the true state of things in the Northwest, along with the numerous cheap farmers' excursions is the best way the Canadian Pacific Railway can tell the public that they are not afraid of showing the Northwest this year on the contrary.

Aaronstam has been in the city for several days and it is claimed has been waiting for a favorable opportunity to kill his victim. He is said to resemble Bergmann very much and is armed with a revolver in one pocket and a dynamite bomb in the other. The plot was hatched in Vienna and was given to the New York police by Vice-Consul Eberhardt of Austria. Secretary Lovejoy has been warned that he has only until the 10th to live. Other officials of the Carnegie company have also received threatening letters. The police are satisfied, however, that they can frustrate the plans of the Anarchists. A Girl's Terrible Crime Fall River, Mass, August 11 Miss Lizzie Borden is under arrest charged with murdering her father and stepmother last Thursday morning at their home on Second Street. She was brought into the district court room about 3 o'clock this afternoon presumably to give further evidence at the inquest. Miss Borden was accompanied by her sister and Mrs. Brigham. As was the case yesterday, all the proceedings were private. When Miss Lizzie returned from the third inquiry she was a mental and physical wreck and was conducted to the matron's room, where she was arrested at six o'clock. The prisoner will be arraigned in the district court room tomorrow morning. Had Not Rained for Three Years San Antonio, Tex, August 11 Heavy general rains have continued for several days over Southwestern Texas, covering the drought region on the Lower Rio Grande and extending into Northern Mexico, where it has not rained for three years, and where much suffering existed. The Rio Grande is in a boom for the first time for several years. Washouts on the railroads are numerous, and bridges have been swept away at many places. Twelve miles from here a waterspout washed out the track of the Southern Pacific railway and stranded several farmhouses. This downpour is invaluable, breaking an extensive drought and ending much misery.

Default,319,N to whose memory the present work is inscribed It must indeed have been interesting for these two men to compare the old scenes with the new and to revive the memory of that great battle in which the troops of five nations exhibited their powers of endurance and of fighting under every form of suffering and disadvantage Occasionally in the course of his work Sir Evelyn Wood pauses to compare the scenes of the old combats with the scenes now presented He tells us in general that there has been no striking change The city of Sebastopol has never quite recovered the ruin wrought by the bombardment The outlines of the trenches and redoubts are still clear But of course the Russians have re-fortified the place and strengthened the position in view of future operations These operations may never take place since the choice of a landing place was originally made elsewhere and the battleground of the Crimea was a second and compromise choice due it is understood to Lyons the commander of the naval force and not to the generals of the Allies But the battles of Europe have with singular consistency been fought on much the same ground from century to century Napoleon fought over the ground on which Charles the Bold was slain Wellington fought over fields on which the Black Prince had made his campaigns In the Franco-German war the battlefields were often those over which the Allies and Napoleon contested No doubt the same military considerations prevail from age to age and positions which were thought strong by Caesar may continue strong for centuries still Sir Evelyn Wood like all the military writers makes the strongest attacks on the ignorance of the Parliamentary critics of the war and the want of competence among the officials He quotes with obvious effect a reply of the Secretary at War in which that official pointed out that there could be no lack of means of conveyance for the wounded and sick since in the very papers before the House he noticed that there were 40 pairs of panniers for the conveyance of the invalids He mistook a medical pannier a basket for medical instruments etc for an ambulance This was very bad of course but he made the admission that this mistake was not detected by the critics who were attacking the minister and one of these critics was a colonel in the army If the minister's ignorance was bad that of the political colonel was worse And it may be generally here stated as a fact which we will proceed to point out in detail that the ignorance of the politicians at home was quite equalled by the officers in the field from Lord Raglan down In reviewing Col Colin Campbell's letters prefaced by Lord Wolseley some time ago we had occasion to refer to this fact and to quote from the volume itself the cases which made clear the total want of confidence which prevailed in the chief military officers of our contingent in the Crimea Sir Evelyn Wood quite unconsciously supplies us with more A few of them may serve to prove our case Thus at the very opening of the battle of the Alma (p 38) we find that owing to the deployment of the 3rd French division the English left division had insufficient room that Lord Raglan did not rectify the error and that considerable inconvenience and loss was caused by the crowding Again (p 44) we read that the left division had omitted to cover its front by skirmishers while this precaution was not neglected by the foe and that the result was more suffering and loss to the British troops Again (p 48) we read how Codrington's brigade after the carrying of the first redoubt had become an excited crowd and it was very difficult to evolve order out of chaos in the mixed-up condition of the soldiery Again (p 54) we read how the Fusiliers (Scotch) were sent forward against the enemy with unfixed bayonets and the men had to ask to be allowed to fix them Again (p 56) we read how a column of Russians was mistaken for French and firing was stopped till the Russians undeceived them Again (p 58) the Scotch Fusiliers were ordered to retire when it was the Welsh Fusiliers who were intended to retire Again the French were unable to follow the Russians in their defeat for the reasons that their knapsacks had been left below in the valley and that they had no ammunition left for their guns Again (p 67) we read that in the attack there was among the generals no concerted action Now these are mere matters of detail purely military in character which show that incompetence prevailed in a scandalous way among the officers in the field in the very everyday duties they had been supposed to be studying Much loss of life was thus incurred and much risk to the honor and welfare of Great Britain But the charges against the administration in the matter of supplies for the army have been the most bitter of all and on the whole these charges have a certain degree of force and truthfulness But they deserve to be offset by the very disgraceful ignorance and incompetence and even selfishness of some of the military authorities in neglecting those supplies which were sent and were within reach In his preface the author says that in 1854 the harbor of Balaklava was crowded with British shipping which brought us supplies of food and clothing indeed but for want of adequate arrangements we could not get them conveyed eight miles to our suffering yet uncomplaining soldiers Now surely eight miles of any sort of space on this earth not in active volcanic eruption should not have defeated the chiefs of a starving and freezing army had there been even ordinary capacity at its command They had not enough mules we are told The fact is that they were offered plenty of mules but would not pay the price asked for them and when the official military idiot had got permission to buy the French had done the buying and the British soldiery had still to starve and freeze or to drag on his own back the food for men and horses No amount of ingenuity can save the military authorities from their full share of the responsibility for the suffering of the army in the Crimea Two very remarkable cases of shocking indifference to duty are given A captain whose name is not given but who was mentioned in an order actually left an important post close to the enemy solely on the trifling excuse of hearing shouting in the enemy's camp and bringing his piquet into camp dismissed it without reporting to the senior officer what he had done And again a general officer commanding a brigade lived on board his yacht in Balaklava harbor two miles and a half from his brigade in October and seven and a half miles in November and thus was not present for several hours when his command was under fire at Inkerman Of course these gentlemen were peculiar the heroism of the army was not lessened by them nor its glory tarnished but the fact that their conduct was possible shows that there was incompetence or neglect among those who commanded in chief and were responsible for discipline We must not omit to point out that at the date when Sir E Wood was in the Crimea he was but a midshipman and that both his opportunities and his range of information must have been limited and he does not always enable us to see just where his midshipman experience ended and where his subsequent studies began We do not need to go over with him the experience of the troops in the winter campaign nor his descriptions of the various battles which are very vivid Some of the side-lights he throws upon the campaign are however very interesting Thus

LEARY NEW YORK TIMES WASHINGTON Even as plans are being made for an international effort to map the entire genetic blueprint of humans, plant scientists are proposing similar efforts to understand the hereditary messages that control the characteristics of plants Among other goals, the research could produce tools to modify plant life to better withstand environmental changes and stresses like shifting climates, acid rain, and destruction of native habitats If, for example, global warming changes the growing season in currently productive agricultural areas, they say, it may be possible to develop wheat or corn that adjusts and thrives under the new conditions The Agriculture Department has established an office in its principal scientific branch, the Agricultural Research Service, to lay plans for what it hopes will be a 10-year, $500 million program to study the genes that control traits like drought resistance and nutrient use in economically important plants In a broader project, the National Institutes of Health and the Energy Department are leading a federal effort, in cooperation with other countries, to map the human genome, or genetic blueprint The proposed 15-year program, estimated to cost more than $3 billion, would attempt to locate and establish the chemical structure of each of the estimated 50,000 to 100,000 genes that reside on the 46 chromosomes in each human cell Genes are segments of DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, the basic material of heredity, which controls production of proteins responsible for all characteristics of an organism A goal of the plant genome mapping program is to understand how different plants or species of plants work at a basic genetic level to handle such things as heat stress and pest resistance, and to see if beneficial characteristics might be transferred among different crop varieties Focus on gene systems No decision has been made on what crops or characteristics will be studied first, but candidate plants recommended by various interests include wheat, barley, cotton, tomatoes, corn, potatoes, and soybeans Dr. Jerome P. Miksch, the Agriculture Department plant scientist who was appointed in August to head the proposed project, said the program would not attempt to chart all the DNA in one plant, as the human genome project is to do for people The number of chemical subunits that make up DNA is about the same in a plant like corn as it is in humans, he said, and completely mapping its genetic structure would rival the human project in size and expense It makes more sense to focus on gene systems or traits, such as growth, heat tolerance, or moisture content, and see how those things are regulated by genes in several different plants, Miksch said in an interview If we find the gene for heat tolerance in a plant, for instance, we could take it out and see if we can transfer it to important crops in anticipation of climate changes Application Deadline March 1 Champlain Regional College (St. Lambert Campus) 672-6240 Dawson College 933-1234 Marianopolis College 931-8792 Vanier College 744-7100 CEGEP applications and further information can be obtained from your high school guidance counsellor's office or from the Admissions Office of any of the above colleges Advertising brings product information to you CANADIAN ADVERTISING FOUNDATION JANNY SCOTT LOS ANGELES TIMES BURBANK, Calif Blushing is a peculiar business Humans alone are blessed, or cursed, with the ability to blush It is mysterious, a physiological fire ignited by a psychological spark: Few blush in private Yet there is little agreement on the meaning of blushing Why does it",1,19900224,modern,heat,0,0,0,0,0,0,

ELISABETH KALBFUSS GAZETTE QUEBEC BUREAU QUEBEC Quebec and Canada's western provinces could unite in bargaining with the federal government for more jurisdiction over the telecommunications industry Communications Minister Liza Frulla-Hebert said yesterday Federal Communications Minister Marcel Masse announced last fall he would move to take back control over communications after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in August that the federal government had jurisdiction over all telecommunications I think the other provinces are quite uncomfortable this time too with the federal position Frulla Hydro workers rally at GAZETTE QUEBEC BUREAU QUEBEC With a negotiating sprint continuing about 4,000 Hydro-Quebec workers yesterday staged a noisy demonstration outside the National Assembly to press for a contract settlement Carrying placards and banners the workers bused in from across the province stood in the cold to listen to their leaders denounce the government's attitude in the labor dispute now into its 15th month We can show once again that we can still stand together and that we won't let ourselves be run around union official Pierre Froment told workers as they drank coffee or beer and listened to rock music The house was not sitting Although the union provided its own crowd control officers police lined the steps and approaches to the assembly building Workers were restricted to an area behind crowd-control barriers well away from the building No incidents were reported The point of the demonstration is to remind the government that Homemade bomb blasts newspaper vending box THE GAZETTE QUEBEC A homemade bomb touched off an explosion and small fire in a Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper vending box Sunday night just three blocks from the National Assembly Quebec City police Const Yvon Barabe said no one was injured in the 10:15 p m blast on St Cyrille St near de la Chevrotiere St A smell of gunpowder came from the box which was sent to the Surete du Quebec in Montreal for chemical analysis Jean-Claude Desrosiers the Quebec City distribution agent for the Globe said a small medicine bottle of what he believed to be gunpowder had been set inside the box but CLIP AND WAVE In a very short while you're going to need this fan Because in Montreal the summers are always hot And humid And muggy Or you can have a Lennox central air

over communications They other provinces are going from a system where they ruled their own telephone companies she said In Saskatchewan it was going very well Their technology was quite developed Now they're facing a situation where they're losing it all The federal bill would bring the provincial telephone companies of Manitoba Saskatchewan and Alberta under federal jurisdiction Two weeks ago Frulla-Hebert sent Masse a 13-page letter spelling out Quebec's concerns after almost five months of rotating strikes the employees of Hydro-Quebec want a signed agreement Froment told reporters later Conciliation aimed at settling the dispute took place all weekend and continued yesterday said Carol Mathieu She said Seguin has put no limit on the time allocated to conciliator Normand Gauthier Salary work hours job creation and subcontracting are the main issues Hydro's 14,000 technicians office and trades workers members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees have staged rotating strikes since November and have been without a contract since December 1988 They want 6-per-cent pay increases in each year of a three-year contract Hydro is offering 4 per cent for 1989 and plus 4 per cent a year for the next three years Hydro officials are to argue for rate increases before a committee of the assembly but those hearings don't start until today Philip Authier police were unable to tell him how it had been detonated He said language tensions frequently exacerbate the vandalism to the English newspaper's 150 boxes in the Quebec City region After the Supreme Court decision striking down sections of Bill 101 last year we had some painting graffiti on boxes Desrosiers said That lasted about a month and a half Police said they had no suspects or motive for the bombing Barabe said there was no reason to believe it was anything more than a random act of vandalism unrelated to any language tensions in the province Absolutely not he said It was an isolated incident W

A8 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, MONDAY, APRIL 9, 1990 Alberta Conservatives reaffirm support for Meech Lake Premier Don Getty checks his watch 'Meech and Merriment' Liberal fundraiser slammed by Crosbie CANADIAN PRESS OTTAWA Trade Minister John Crosbie attacked yesterday a $1,000 per ticket benefit dinner dubbed ""Meech and Merriment"" being organized in Toronto for the Liberal Party of Newfoundland. Crosbie said he was shocked by the letter, signed by David Mac-Naughton of Toronto, inviting people to a cocktail reception and dinner in Toronto where Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells will be the guest of honor. ""I regard this letter as highly inappropriate and that's putting a mild connotation on it,"" Crosbie said in an interview. ""It passes understanding for insensitivity and crassness,"" he said, adding he hoped the dinner would be cancelled. He said he believed the letter had been sent to about 400 people. ""The Meech Lake accord is hardly a subject of merriment. It's a question of the unity of Canada, whether Canada will continue to survive as a united nation."" ""Premier Wells has just put in jeopardy the possibility of any settlement of that issue by taking the unprecedented step of using closure to push through a constitutional resolution that disallows and reverses an earlier constitutional resolution of the legislative assembly of Newfoundland."" The provincial legislature formally revoked its support for the accord early Friday morning. The accord, which would augment powers for all provinces and bring Quebec into the constitution as a distinct society, must be approved by the legislatures of all provinces by June 23. The letter said Ontario Premier David Peterson had also agreed to take part in the evening's events. Crosbie said the dinner was originally scheduled for March 29 but he believed it had been rescheduled to April 17. ""It is highly inappropriate at this point in time to use an occasion like this to try to raise a large sum of money for the Liberal Party of Newfoundland based on the misfortunes of Canadians generally,"" Crosbie said. He said that at $1,000 a ticket, the invitations were aimed at Toronto businessmen, lawyers and accountants. ""The union had complained the blue polyester and acrylic clothing can cause rashes and doesn't protect against extreme heat or cold."" Other complaints included the fact the baggy clothing was ugly and could catch on machinery and postal vehicles. The uniforms range from shorts, shirts and bow ties for men to baggy slacks, shirts and scarves for women. The outerwear features baseball caps and oversize collarless jackets. Workers have complained the uniforms make them look like ice cream salesmen or shrunken airline attendants. Less than 10 percent of Edmonton's postal workers are wearing any part of the uniform, McMaster said. Bob McRory, a Canada Post spokesman in Edmonton, couldn't be reached for comment. McMaster said 23,000 workers across the country who received an average of two shirts each have been told to return the clothing. APRIL 13, 1990 MONDAY, APRIL 16, 1990 CANADIAN PRESS PRINCE ALBERT, Sask. Three employees of an Indian residential school in Saskatchewan say they were passed over for promotions because they are not native. Lorne Milligan, Lorna Greig and Gloria Sabo, who work for the Prince Albert Indian Residential School, applied unsuccessfully for positions at the school more than a year ago. ""I would just like to be treated with the same dignity and respect that I have given them,"" Sabo said, referring to the Prince Albert Tribal Council, which runs the school. The three complained more than a year ago to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. They said they decided to go public now because the commission still hasn't taken any action. Milligan, employed in maintenance at the school since 1984, applied for a full-time janitor's job. Greig and Sabo, who each worked 'Desperate' CANADIAN PRESS DIGBY, N.

GAZETTE NEWS SERVICES LYSEKIL, Sweden Firefighters braved heat and poisonous smoke from a 2-day-old fire yesterday to begin removing bodies of an estimated 147 victims from the Scandinavian Star ferry. The suspicious blaze began before dawn Saturday while the ship was in the North Sea carrying about 500 tourists and crew from Norway to Denmark. Yesterday Norwegian police said they were checking for links between the blaze and earlier North Sea ferry fires, at least one of which was deliberately set. The assistant chief of police, Magnar Aukrust, said the authorities began examining arson as a possible cause after the captain, members of the crew and some passengers of the ferry said they believed the fire was set deliberately. On the ferry, the heat was so intense yesterday that it melted aluminum on the ship's bridge. Firefighters in masks and breathing equipment fought through one corridor ""until their gear started to burn,"" said fire consultant Olle Wennstrom. The fire spread early yesterday from the gutted middle section to the captain's bridge a few hours after the ship was towed into port. Police chief Roar Onso, revising earlier figures, said 345 people survived, which broke out about midway on the ship's 10-hour voyage from Oslo to Frederikshavn. Ferry captain Hugo Larsen told police there were 395 passengers and 97 crewmen. If his figures are correct, 147 people died, Onso said. Early today, a fire broke out on a car ferry carrying 297 people from Britain's west coast to Ireland, killing a crew member and injuring at least eight other people, officials said. The fire started beneath the car deck as the ferry Norrano was 15 kilometers west of the Welsh coast. The fire was brought under control.

another 1,300 are treated and released ""If that isn't an epidemic, I don't know what is"" CHIRPP is the first program with the potential to determine how many product-related injuries are due to faulty design and how many to poor supervision It will provide an essential first step toward sound program and policy development, Pless said ""And data available through CHIRPP could lead to successes like the dramatic reduction in poisoning that followed safety packaging,"" he said ""The root of this problem was only understood because data were systematically recorded by the poison control centres and then used to evaluate the impact of new packaging regulations"" Pless believes that 70 percent of childhood injuries can be prevented with proper prevention CHIRPP is modelled on the Australian National Injury Surveillance and Prevention Program, which has been operating for three years Rather than incurring the expense of creating a brand new program, an agreement was reached between the Australian and Canadian governments, allowing Canada to use the computer software at no cost, said Dr. Greg Sherman, head of the childhood injury and disease section at Health and Welfare Canada Board puts off school decision for one month MARY LAMEY THE GAZETTE Parents with children at Ecole Westminster in Notre Dame de Grace will wait another month before learning which school their offspring will attend next year, the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal decided last night Parents have complained for more than two years of overcrowding at Westminster, saying the only solution is to open another French school in the area The board disagrees In a resolution passed last night, the PSBGM decided it will either redistribute students at four French primary schools in west-end Montreal Westminster, Iona, Bedford and Guy Drummond or recommend that children from Westminster be moved to an annex of West Hill High School The school and orientation committees will hold consultation meetings March 12-16 and the board will make its decision on March 28, Michael George, director general of the PSBGM, said last night Cassandra Tcrtulliani, chairman of the Westminster parents' committee said neither proposition is acceptable and both were rejected by the committee last year She vowed a tough fight on the issue ""When push comes to shove all the parents can do is think of the welfare of their kids This is not consultation and these are not solutions"" In January, the board announced it would solve the overcrowding by repossessing Rosedale School which has housed the Montreal Urban Community police department's Station 15 for 10 years That plan fell through when the board discovered it could not legally evict the police Plateau residents have heat Only about 30 people made use of shelter 26 hours later JAMES MENNIE THE GAZETTE Georges Ricard, a 66-year-old resident of Papineau Ave, jammed his pillow under his arm yesterday as he prepared to leave Centre Pere Marquette on Marquette St Ricard among about 30 people lucky enough to hear radio announcements that the city of Montreal had established a shelter for residents affected by a 26-hour power failure had been at the centre since 10:30 p.m. Tuesday Yesterday, he didn't even want to talk about Hydro-Quebec ""We were lucky we had this battery radio,"" Ricard said, holding the transistor radio in his other hand ""If other people had it, you can bet there'd be more people here"" Ricard was able to sleep on a cot, have some coffee and eat at the centre's cafeteria while Hydro-Quebec crews worked to repair an underground cable He didn't call the utility for an explanation as to why his electric heating conked out in sub-zero weather ""I don't want to hear about Hydro-Quebec,"" he said Did he complain? ""What for? To whom?"" he asked ""We can't do anything about it, you can't complain to these guys"" At 2 p.m. yesterday, half an hour after Ricard spoke to The Gazette, power was restored to the 1,800 clients in an area bordered by Rosemont Blvd and de Lorimier, Laurier and Papineau Aves that had been without power since noon Tuesday Fourteen hours later, another cable failed, plunging about 175 customers in Rosemount into darkness about 1:50 a.m. yesterday ""That job (repairing the initial failure) would have taken a long time to fix,"" said Hydro-Quebec official Daniel Guertin ""But the delays we have encountered in repairing a second blackout are due to union pressure tactics We have to negotiate with the union to get technicians on the scene, and that's what's causing the delay"" As of 6 p.m. last night, the Rosemount area was still without power Guertin claimed that under normal conditions, the repair job would not have taken more than two hours However Pierre Froment, the union official responsible for overseeing essential services during rotating strikes by Hydro-Quebec technicians, said the delay was due to technical, not labor problems ""The blackout occurred at 1:50 a.m. and we were on the scene at 3:29 a.m.,"" he said ""When you consider the average response time for Hydro-Quebec crews is five hours, that's pretty good"" Cots and food for residents forced out of their homes by the power failures were supplied by the city of Montreal's emergency centre Municipal employees and volunteers from the Red Cross provided those who showed up with assistance Montreal Urban Community police, meanwhile, stepped up patrols in the affected area overnight GAZETTE PHOTO CHURCH Georges Ricard and son Serge carry belongings from Centre Pere Marquette after waiting out power failure EXPAND YOUR HORIZONS Michele passed her flight test after only 3.9 hours of multi-engine training WE OFFER THE BEST PILOT TRAINING FROM STUDENT PERMITS RIGHT THROUGH TO AIRLINE TRANSPORT RATING MY PRO PILOT COURSES Commercial, Multi-instrument, instructor 1 year $27,500 Based on Transport Canada minimal requirements Call Glenn French LAURENTIDE AVIATION 425-2211 CEDARS AIRPORT Learn to fly: It's just plane smarts Ville de Montreal Notice to taxpayers Municipal taxes The Ville de Montreal is currently mailing out its municipal tax bills for the 1990 fiscal year Type of tax Due date Real Estate Tax Business, Water and Services Tax (places of business) April 1, 1990: First instalment or payment in full (if the tax bill is less than $300) Special Tax (Permits) on businesses, occupations and events Payment in full, on or before April 1, 1990 Payment through your bank or caisse populaire The Service des finances urges you to make your payment at your caisse populaire, or your bank on or before April 1, 1990 You will be issued a receipt immediately Change of address You must advise the Service des finances of any change of address by return mail, using the return envelope included with your tax bill Service des finances Information: 872-2305 Notice to English-speaking taxpayers Taxpayers (physical persons only) who, for 1990, want an English version of their municipal tax bill, and who, for 1990 and following DENIS 7347, 54, $425 heated July 1, 5500 BORDEN AVE (Corner Cole St, Luc Rd) Spacious 3?, 54 apis for immediate or later occupancy 861-7287, 336-0711 BRIGHT clean 3? upper duplex, near C.S.L. shopping centre, 481-0560 481-0560 BRIGHT 3?, heat & hydro paid Mall & bus stop on corner 487-9108 CAVENDISH Mall, adjacent modern 3?, 4? apt, new carpet, security, laundry, pool and park-like setting Winter spring specials, 6000 Cavendish, 481-9354 CONDO 3?, new, on Rembrandt St, Jean-Paul 468-0650, Sol 933-5707, 487-9107 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, MONTREAL TRUST BAIE D'URFE RENOVATED DREAM HOME WITH LAKE-VIEWS! 4 bedrooms, 1? bathrooms, heat pump and more!

Business Services 352 HIGHLY experienced English steno typist with own word processor available to undertake assignments from the home McGill's Bruce McElroy (left) Martlets surrender halftime lead, lose tournament to Dalhousie Redmen 65, Blues 63 Dalhousie 64, Martlets 52 By PAUL CARBRAY of The Gazette On paper, the McGill Redmen basketball team has a tough time matching up with other Ontario Universities Athletic Association teams And with David Steiner, their second-leading scorer, on the bench trying to shake off a persistent cold, the Redmen appeared to be ripe for the plucking at the hands of the University of Toronto Blues yesterday But the gritty Redmen scrapped to a 65-63 win over the Blues, giving the Toronto team an 0-3 mark on their swing through Quebec during the weekend The Blues lost to the Concordia Stingers Friday and were dropped in overtime by the Bishop's Gaiters Saturday The win gave the Redmen a 5-1 mark in the OUAA East Division, two wins back of the leading Stingers, a lofty spot many didn't figure they'd occupy ""It's the same every season, no one figures we'll do well,"" said coach Ken Schildroth ""But we'll always have a competitive team because we have a system of teaching the players over time We don't just look at one game or one season, we look at the long haul"" The key man for the Redmen yesterday, besides Paul Brousseau, who led McGill in scoring with 25 points, was point guard Mike Soussan With Steiner out, Soussan ran the McGill offense, chipped in 10 points and set a tough defensive pace ""I thought Soussan played a great game,"" said Schildroth ""He really hustled on defense"" Soussan said he missed Steiner ""He sure makes it a lot easier on my game,"" said the fourth-year physical education student ""With him in there, I know if I can get him the ball, it's usually good for two points But Bruce (McElroy) really stepped in and did a great job"" McElroy, in fact, had 18 points, including a couple of three-pointers with less than five minutes remaining as the teams battled down the stretch But it was Brousseau, McGill's top scorer this season, who supplied the key basket, a turnaround jumper with 1:40 remaining that gave the Redmen a 63-62 lead The Blues looked as if they were going to retake the lead as Nick Saul broke away seconds later, but the hustling Soussan raced back to slap the ball out of Saul's hands Brousseau then added a pair of foul shots and the Redmen held off the Blues Soussan said Schildroth's system of teaching players pays for the Redmen's team's 2-1 third-round victory over Walsall of the Third Division ""I would have been happy with anyone at home, but to get Manchester United is unbelievable"" Arsenal was immediately installed as the new 4-1 favorites to lift the Cup, as the team came out of the hat with a home game against either Queens Park Rangers or Cardiff, who replay on Wednesday Defending champion Liverpool, if it overcomes Swansea in tomorrow's replay, will be on the road to the winners of the Norwich-Exeter game, which replays on Wednesday ""When it comes down to the end in a tight game, we don't lose our composure,"" said Soussan ""Most of the players who are on the court are fourth-year players and they don't lose their cool Ken has a real system He really stresses things like position on defense In practices, we run play after play When you first come to McGill, you kind of question what he's doing, but when you get to your third or fourth year, you know the system and you see how well it works In a game like this, it pays off"" Mark Harvey led the Blues with 16 points and Rob Wilson added 12 In other OUAA East action yesterday, Pierre Tibblin's 14 points lifted the undefeated Gaiters to a 101-63 victory over Ryerson Polytechnic Institute of Toronto The win boosted Bishop's record to 6-0 Earlier in the day at McGill, the host Martlets, with a chance to win their invitational women's basketball tournament, let a 30-23 halftime lead slip away and wound up losing 64-52 to the Dalhousie Tigers Things were a little complicated because the tournament was a four-team round-robin, but the result allowed the Laval Rouge et Or to capture the tourney Laval, McGill and Dalhousie all wound up with 2-1 records, with Laval winning on point spread The Queen's Golden Gaels ended up 0-3 The Rouge et Or defeated the In yesterday's other action Charlton tied Bradford City 1-1, Manchester United beat Nottingham Forest 1-0 and Port Vale and Derby County played to a 1-1 draw On Saturday, defending-champion Liverpool was held to a scoreless tie by Swansea of the Third Division, and four Division One teams were defeated There were a couple of mild upsets, with First Division weaklings Wimbledon and Luton losing on the road to Second Division clubs, and one shocker tiny Torquay of the Fourth Division defeated West Ham Gazette, Dave Sidaway during 65-63 Redmen win Gaels 60-59, thanks to 20 points from Lucie Bellemare and tourney all-star Chantal Denis's layup with less than 30 seconds remaining for the winning points The Tigers, having to beat McGill by at least 20 points in the tourney finale to give themselves the title, led by 18 against the Martlets with 2:04 remaining, but they tired and allowed the Martlets to come back ""They played well on defense against us in the second half,"" said Martlets coach Chris Hunter ""They put pressure on the ball at halfcourt We're not used to starting our offense so high up"" Missing Hayman The Tigers also started to move the ball inside on offense in the second half and the smaller Martlets, who were missing 6-foot-3 Tracey Hayman, couldn't cope Hayman injured her knee when she slipped on a patch of ice while Christmas shopping ""We still haven't proven that we can win against a physical team,"" said Hunter ""They're a big, strong team and that type of team will always give us problems"" Angie McLeod, the tourney's most valuable player, led Dalhousie with 25 points, giving her 57 in the three games Other all-stars were Queen's Nancy Coke, Laval's Sonia Ritchie and Dalhousie's Kelly Copeland a Second Division club that played last year in Division One Division One teams heading for midweek replays are Aston Villa which salvaged a 2-2 tie against a Blackburn club from the Second Division that threatened to score several times in the closing minutes and Chelsea, held to a 1-1 tie at home by Crewe of the Third Division Also facing replays are Everton, which had a 0-0 result at Middlesbrough; and Manchester City and Millwall, which battled each other to a 0-0 tie CARLSBAD, Calif (AP) - Paul Azinger capitalized on Ian Baker-Finch's last-hole mistake yesterday for a one-stroke victory in the Tournament of Champions, the opening event on the 1990 Professional Golfers' Association Tour schedule Baker-Finch blunted his own great comeback when he bogeyed the final hole from a fairway bunker, setting it up for Azinger to break a tie with a routine, two-putt par on the 72nd hole Azinger won the event that brings together only the winners of 1989 PGA Tour titles with a final-round 69 and a 272 total, 16 under par on the La Costa Country Club course Big boost Azinger's sixth victory of an eight-year career was worth $135,000 from the total purse of $750,000 and, Baker-Finch said, ""gives him a big boost to the year"" Baker-Finch, who has scored 11 victories around the world and qualified for this event with his lone American triumph last year in the Colonial tournament, had a closing 68 and a 273 total He won $82,000 Mark O'Meara, playing with an ailing back, had a 69 that put him in third at 276 Australian Wayne Grady was next at 278 after a 69 Greg Norman and Scott Hoch were next at 279 Norman had a closing 70, Hoch shot a 71 In a separate but simultaneous competition for winners of 1989 Seniors Tour titles, George Archer scored an unchallenged seven-shot victory Archer, holding a seven-stroke lead when the day's play started, needed only a 2-over-par 74 over the final 18 holes for the runaway triumph Archer's victory, his second in seven starts since becoming eligible after serious auto mishap ADELAIDE, Australia (AP)-Thomas Muster of Austria rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the final set to beat Jimmy Arias of the United States 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 last night and win the $150,000 (U.S.) (AP-CP) - Cam Neely and Bobby Carpenter scored 32 seconds apart in the second period as the Boston Bruins beat Buffalo 2-1 last night and overtook the Sabres atop the National Hockey League's Adams Division For the second night in a row, Buffalo coach Rick Dudley threatened to start two-a-day practices as he watched his team lose its fifth consecutive game Boston's fourth straight victory gave the Bruins 53 points, one more than the Sabres, who have lost three in a row at home to the Bruins The Bruins went 0-5-3 in the regular season against the Sabres in 1988-89 Neely broke a scoreless tie at 5:11 of the second period, shoving a rebound past Daren Puppa after Craig Janney's shot hit both posts Carpenter made it 2-0 when he was allowed to skate out from behind the Buffalo net Puppa stopped his first shot, but the rebound came right back to Carpenter and he banked the shot in off Puppa's glove for his 500th NHL point Phil Housley ended Reggie Lemelin's shutout bid at 7:36 of the final period He skated from behind the net to about 10 feet in front before scoring on a backhander through heavy traffic Lemelin finished with 26 saves The Sabres' only other legitimate scoring opportunity came in the second period when Alexander Mogilny broke in alone from the blue line and deked Lemelin to the ice But the puck bounced off Mogilny's stick and his backhander went wide Lemelin said Boston coach Mike Milbury told his team to consider the game in the same context as a post-season confrontation ""Mike considered that a playoff game and he wanted us to play that way and we responded,"" said Lemelin, who made 26 saves in winning his seventh straight decision ""The games are starting to mean a lot more, especially a road game like this against a team in first place,"" Lemelin said ""This is where you really measure your talent"" Dudley wondered where most of his talent was hiding, and considered banishing a few of his better players to the press box Flames 3, Oilers 1 EDMONTON (CP) - From towering Joel Otto to minuscule Theoren Fleury, the Calgary Flames banged, bumped and crashed their way to a 3-1 win over the Edmonton Oilers Defencemen Brad McCrimmon and Al MacInnis scored second-period goals and Mike Vernon made 28 stops as the Flames moved to within three points of first-place Edmonton in the Smythe Division The two rivals battle again in Calgary tomorrow night ""We said all along we haven't been happy,"" Flames coach Terry Crisp said, reflecting on his club's sub-par performance through the first half of the season ""The most critical shift we had was Fleury, (Paul) Ranheim and (Doug) Gilmour,"" he said ""They hit whatever moved and if it didn't move, they hit it until they moved it the three little guys Our bench was just going crazy"" The Flames were bolstered by the addition of tough-guy farmhands Stu Grimson and Marc Bureau on the forward lines and Ken Sabourin on defense Grimson twice fought Edmonton's Dave Brown before the teams settled down But all of the Flames hit, rubbed Oilers against the boards and generally slowed the Edmonton team down, snapping the Oilers' 14-game unbeaten streak at home, a club record Edmonton had not lost in Northlands Coliseum since Nov 4 in a 3-1 loss to Pittsburgh Against Calgary, a sellout crowd of 17,503 grew impatient as the game wore on During the streak, the Oilers were 11-0-3 But in their last five games, including a three-game road trip, the Oilers are 1-3-1 and seem to have lost the edge that brought them to first place overall in the NHL Only rookie forward Martin Gelinas, on a deflection during a third-period Edmonton power play, was able to beat Vernon Jiri Hrdina had the other Calgary goal with one minute left against Bill Ranford, who stopped 23 shots For Calgary, defenceman Jamie Macoun had two assists ""We had numerous good chances but we just couldn't score against Vernon,"" said Oilers' coach John Muckler ""We've had some tough games and some of our players looked a little tired"" Red Army 6, Blackhawks 4 CHICAGO - Evgeny Davydov scored on a breakaway and assisted on Igor Chibirev's breakaway goal as Central Red Army defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 6-4 in an exhibition game The Red Army team won its third straight on its NHL tour after losing to Winnipeg on Dec 27 The touring Red Army and Moscow Dynamo teams now have a combined 9-9-1 record against the NHL in the so-called Super Series Each has one game left on the schedule, the Red Army playing at Philadelphia and Moscow Dynamo at Boston tomorrow night Chelios out for 10 days with groin injury Chris Chelios was a scratch last night a surprise, apparently, to everyone except Chelios ""I've been telling everybody I've got an injury in the groin area,"" he said before last night's game ""I thought everybody knew about it"" Few did, including the Canadiens' public relations people who weren't advised about it until yesterday afternoon Apparently, Chelios suffered his injury during the Canadiens' 2-1 loss at Vancouver roughly 10 days ago That didn't stop him from playing two nights later in Edmonton, where he spent 14 of the first 30 minutes in the penalty box, and in Calgary the following night, where the Canadiens lost 5-3 after taking an early 2-0 lead Chelios also played Saturday night when the Canadiens snapped a four-game losing streak with a 6-3 win over the Buffalo Sabres Chelios tried skating yesterday CANADIENS NOTEBOOK Red Fisher morning and experienced difficulty He won't play for the next 10 days at least, and probably longer Chelios's unavailability opened a spot for Eric Desjardins, who didn't dress for Saturday's game against the Buffalo Sabres Bobby Smith also didn't make it last night because of a bruised shoulder That allowed Brent Gilchrist to dress Mike Keane missed his fourth consecutive game Claude Lemieux earned his first round of applause since returning to the lineup when he became involved in a bout with Vancouver tough guy Ronnie Stern, who played his junior hockey in Longueuil The fracas erupted early in the second period Stern went to the penalty box, Lemieux to the dressing room presumably for repairs Lemieux, by the way, played on a line with Brian Skrudland and Mike McPhee The night before, he was part of the Smith-Walter line Tough guy Todd Ewen was involved in one of the game's highlights when he leaped out of the penalty box, jumped on a loose puck, made a mad dash around the net and drew a penalty when he was hauled to the ice For some reason, Ewen didn't stay on the ice for the ensuing power play Still, the entire Canadiens' bench gave him high fives when he returned to the bench Canadiens centreman Smith and Ryan Walter will be at the All-Star Game in Pittsburgh - but not as players Smith will be there as part of the committee responsible for the selection of a deputy executive director of the National Hockey League Players Association He and five other members of the committee will interview six candidates Then player reps, including Walter, will be asked to ratify the selection The Canadiens are on the road for two games this week They're in Quebec tomorrow; and then travel to New Jersey, where they play Friday before returning to the Forum Saturday for a game against the Philadelphia Flyers Fans crying for head of Sagueneens coach Drapeau The Chicoutimi Sagueneens could have a new coach and general manager by as early as tonight's game (8 p.m.) against College Francais at Longueuil's Jean Beliveau Co As of yesterday afternoon Gaston Drapeau was in an extremely precarious position In fact, his fate may well have rested on last night's game against Victoriaville They'd better hope it didn't; the Sags were clobbered 9-1 Chicoutimi is ninth in the 11-team QMJHL with an 8-23-2 record, including just two victories and a tie in their last 11 games Fans at the Centre Georges Vezina apparently were looking for Drapeau's scalp last Friday while Chicoutimi was being whitewashed 11-3 by Hull ""We have lots of work to do, it's a critical period for us,"" said governor Gaston Senechal ""We have to win, if we don't it will be dangerous for Gaston"" The crowd is starting to cry about him ""Now we have a team with big guys but they don't work and don't play"" Members of the board of directors are beginning to ask questions The directors had scheduled an emergency meeting for 7:30 this morning The Sags have made two major deals since Dec 22, acquiring Daniel Dors, Denis Chaste and Pierre-Paul Landry from Drummondville, and Patrice Martineau from Laval, mortgaging away a large part of their future in the process In other news regarding the Sags, 19-year-old defenceman Marc Boudreau has been sent home Boudreau was suspended for 10 days earlier this season by Drapeau due to a poor attitude ""There's no amelioration with that guy,"" Senechal complained ""He has no interest in hockey, his most important interest is girls"" Evidently, a four-day holiday over the New Year wasn't enough for Daniel Gauthier Gauthier played for Victoriaville Dec 29 against Trois Rivieres, but remained at home in Charlemagne when the Tigres resumed their schedule Jan 3 at Drummondville Although the 19-year-old left wing-centre appears to have everything in the world to play for he was a third-round choice of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1988 and was the Tigres' leading scorer with 22 goals and 26 assists in 35 games he required some time at home to reflect upon his career ""The last month (December) he wasn't playing the way he thought he could and

Chicoutimi was delayed two hours when the Sagueneens' bus was delayed en route due to an automobile accident in which two persons were killed The delay forced the Draveurs, who arrived for the 7:30

research work was being conducted by university professors and the ethics centre had no classrooms The centre's collection of research in medical ethics was the largest in Canada and one of the largest in the world Dr Margaret Somerville, director of the centre, said a great deal of important current and unpublished research material, notably on AIDS-related issues, was destroyed in the fire ""It's all up here,"" Somerville said, pointing to her head, ""and it can all be reproduced, but it's just a tremendous waste of time"" The ethics centre mailed copies of its published research to interested individuals and institutions around the world and will try to retrieve copies ""What we're going to do is ask everybody who has a copy of something we've done to send us a copy back,"" Somerville said ""Other rooms on the two top floors were occupied by professors, including former premier Pierre Marc Johnson Johnson, a law professor who is supervising the centre's new program on environmental issues, was lucky None of the material his research team has compiled on the issue of waste disposal by hospitals was inside Lady Meredith House when the fire broke out Johnson was among a half-dozen professors who arrived around 10 a.m. to inspect the damage ""I feel badly for my colleagues,"" he said Firefighters had trouble putting out the blaze because they couldn't get up on to the roof and use their axes to help ventilate the building The Lady Meredith House had a high sloped roof, and ice made climbing on it impossible ""So the fire was able to spread up through the wood

Allan Memorial Institute was built as Hugh Allan's private estate The Merediths built their redbrick mansion, which they called Ardvarna, on the southwest corner of Pine Ave and Peel St in 1892 according to the architectural plans of Edward Maxwell, the leading Canadian architect of his generation Maxwell was born in Montreal on New Year's Eve, 1867 After dropping out of high school at age 14, he joined a Montreal firm as a draftsman's apprentice He showed precocious ability in architecture, soon joined a Boston firm, where he excelled, then returned to his native Montreal in 1891 The same year, at age 24, he was hired by Lady Meredith to design Ardvarna The house was built with money from the Allan family Meredith died in 1929, and in 1941 his widow donated it to the Royal Victoria Hospital for use as a nurses' residence, Lady Meredith died in 1959 Among Maxwell's other works are the Henry Birks and Sons Ltd building on St Catherine St, the central tower of the Château

Yesterday, however, Harper said the plan would succeed where the previous Liberal government failed after making Arctic melting picks up. The Arctic could be ice-free in summer within two decades, according to a new study showing polar ice has been disappearing almost three times faster than projected by most climate models. The shrinking summertime ice is about 30 years ahead of projections used by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which recently suggested the Arctic would not lose its ice before 2050, according to new U.S. findings published today in Geophysical Research Letters. When the summer ice goes, scientists say it will be an extraordinary change for the planet, which has had a polar ice cap for close to a million years.

GLOBAL WARMING CONTROVERSY pie in the sky: Harper ""pie-in-the-sky promises"" but doing nothing to stop greenhouse gas emissions from rising by more than 35 per cent above the target it agreed to under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. ""You have to balance environmental progress while preserving jobs,"" Harper told the Commons. ""That's what the minister of the environment has done. He's taking the tough decisions that they (the Liberals) didn't have the guts to take."" The Tory plan calls for air pollution to be cut in half by 2015, and for greenhouse gases to be cut to concentrations five per cent above 1990 levels in 2020—abandoning Canada's international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. Critics of the Conservative plan have zeroed in on its ""intensity"" targets for reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. Environmentalists reject intensity targets because they are linked to economic growth and can be achieved despite allowing overall emissions to rise. Baird has argued his plan sets a high enough intensity target to force a real reduction within five years. The three opposition parties said they plan to mobilize public opinion to force the Tories to accept the tougher plan they crafted during a lengthy review of the government's clean air and climate change legislation. The opposition proposed a ""carbon budget"" approach that would impose absolute reductions on industry, in line with Canada's Kyoto commitments. ""Canadians are drawing their own conclusions,"" said Liberal environment critic David McGuinty. Meanwhile, New Democratic officials suggested they could use procedural tricks in the Commons to stall the government's agenda, and force it to accept the opposition plan. ""We're not intended to be a critique,"" Williams, who is chairing the event, said in an interview yesterday. ""It will all be with a view to coming out with our own plan, with our own suggestions, (but) I don’t mean that we’re going to come out with a competing or conflicting climate-change plan.""

OTTAWA Green leader Elizabeth May stands by her weekend comments calling Prime Minister Stephen Harper's stance on climate change ""a grievance worse than Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of the Nazis."" May added yesterday that acting on the environment is a ""moral"" issue. The longtime environmentalist said her Chamberlain-Nazi analogy originated with British author George Monbiot, who appeared with Canadian environmentalist David Suzuki in Toronto on the weekend. In what she called an ""environmental sermon"" to the Wesley Knox United Church near London, Ont., on Sunday, May said the government is threatening the genocide of mankind by failing to remedy global warming.

Following a caucus meeting in Montmagny, Premier Jean Charest said Quebec will develop its own green plan while continuing to defend the Kyoto Protocol. ""In my eyes it's fundamental."" For his part, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty intends to float two ideas: an inter-provincial emissions-trading system and a national electricity grid to move green hydroelectric power across the country. Provincial leaders should consider the idea of such a national power grid in much the same way as the trans-Canada railway that helped knit the country together, McGuinty said. Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day told reporters yesterday that Corrections Canada officials have visited some detention centres and had spoken to two inmates who made unsubstantiated allegations of torture. ""The two correctional officers assured the minister that they had seen no evidence of torture,"" said Day's spokeswoman Melisa Leclerc. Last week, Day dismissed complaints of torture as coming from Taliban prisoners who were trained to make up stories of abuse. As the calls for his resignation entered a second week, O'Connor avoided another noisy question period altogether, but his spokeswoman denied rumours he is planning to step down. ""It is not true,"" Isabelle Bouchard said in an email. ""He will not resign."" She explained O'Connor's absence from the House of Commons, saying he had ""to take care of work that needs to be done"" at National Defence headquarters and would return to the Commons today. A senior Conservative insider also said that Harper has no plans to fire O'Connor, who has been accused by the opposition of mismanaging the Afghan detainee transfer issue. The insider said O'Connor has the confidence of the prime minister. But Harper himself remained silent again yesterday when asked directly by Liberal Leader Stephane Dion and his deputy, Michael Ignatieff, whether he still had confidence in his defence minister.

Every player wants to win a major, he said. A major won't help me or hurt me, I don't know how to answer that. Couples has already won three tournaments this year and finished second twice. With a first-prize purse of $270,000, his earnings have soared to $1,008,162. Corey Pavin, playing several groups ahead of Couples, finished third. He shot a 67 and finished at 10 under for the tournament. Six players, including Couples, could not finish their rounds Saturday because of an almost three-hour delay caused by an impending thunderstorm with lightning. Couples played the final four holes of his Saturday round early yesterday morning. So did Craig Parry, who was the leader at the outset of the final round at 12 under par. Couples and Floyd were one and two shots, respectively, behind him. Parry faded quickly, and the tournament virtually evolved into a battle between Couples and Floyd, 49, who won the Masters title in 1976. Couples went ahead of Floyd by one stroke at the ninth hole when he made a curling, 20-foot birdie putt to go 12 under par. Miracle at Amen Corner. PAGE E5 Complete results.

Predictably, Roy writhed on the ice in agony for several moments before continuing in vain. Three minutes later, he left the ice with a bruised knee and was replaced by Andre Racicot, who, just as predictably, allowed a goal on the first shot against him. The period took 70 minutes to be played. The game lasted three hours and 20 minutes. The festivities actually began just seven seconds into the game when Chris Nilan and Rob Ray exchanged unpleasantness. Two minutes later, Brad May received a double minor for spearing. You have to call five minutes and a game there, said Savard. The official wasn't calling the penalties. We had to do something. Savard took the law into his own hands with time running out in the second period. He and Hawerchuk fought. Savard figured it was the first time he had dropped his gloves since early in his 12-year career. When the playoffs come around you have to respond to challenges, he said. You have to respond as we did, as a team. This will be a great thing for us. It'll help us get closer. I just lost my cool because we were getting pushed around. The worst was saved for the third period. In the seventh minute, Ray swung at Mathieu Schneider in the corner. That set off a melee and everyone picked a partner: Pat LaFontaine and Brian Skrudland; Ray and Mike McPhee, and Randy Moller and Schneider.

Pierre Turgeon, Benoit Hogue, Steve Thomas, Adam Creighton, Derek King and Marty McInnis scored for the Islanders, who had been eliminated from playoff contention in the Patrick Division before the strike by NHL players began April 1. Wendel Clark and Joe Sacco scored for Toronto. The loss resulted in mathematical elimination from the Norris Division playoff picture. All the strike wound up doing was postponing the Leafs' demise for 10 days. Minnesota will finish fourth in the Norris. The Leafs outshot New York 39-19. While Islanders goaltender Glenn Healy was hot, Toronto starter Grant Fuhr was forced to the bench after allowing five goals on 12 shots for a 5-1 New York lead. Fuhr was replaced by rookie Felix Potvin at 14:56 of the second period. To not make the playoffs is devastating, said defenceman Bob Rouse. It's difficult, said defenceman Ric Nattress. I don't think I've ever missed the playoffs at any level of hockey. I guess everybody in Toronto is tired of hearing, 'Wait 'til next year,' but I think there have been great improvements here. Unfortunately, it was too little too late for this season. CALGARY The Calgary Flames couldn't dodge the bullet any more and it was the Winnipeg Jets who fired the fatal shot with a 4-3 victory. The victory clinched the final Smythe Division playoff spot for Winnipeg and eliminated the Flames from post-season play for the first time since 1975 when the franchise was based in Atlanta. Ed Olczyk scored twice, while Keith Tkachuk and Aaron Broten had one each for the Jets, who have 77 points, six more than Calgary. Svoboda at HERB ZURKOWSKY THE GAZETTE BUFFALO His eight seasons with the Canadiens were great, he acknowledged. But after only three weeks in Buffalo, Petr Svoboda said coming to the Sabres will revive his career. For me, I believe I'll enjoy this hockey more, the defenceman said prior to last night's game against the Canadiens the first time he has faced his former teammates since the March 10 trade for defenceman Kevin Haller. It's never easy to get traded, he continued. For me, I take it as a challenge, a new chance. It's like a new start. Although he never scored more than eight goals or 45 points in any one season with the Canadiens, Svoboda always fashioned himself as somewhat of an offensive defenceman. However, when you play along Montreal's blue line, freewheeling is frowned upon. In Buffalo, under offensive-minded coach John Muckler, the reins have been cut off. In his first 10 games with the Sabres, he already had seven points. By comparison, he had 21 points in 58 games with the Canadiens. Of course, his plus-minus rating in Buffalo is minus-7 compared with plus-9 with Montreal. I like to play an offensive style, so playing here might fit me better, said the 26-year-old. Some teams, like Montreal, play a better defensive style. Montreal's in first place in the division, so there's not much to complain about. Burns thought incorrectly that Lebeau's nose had been broken. That was out of hand. Stupid, stormed the coach. That's not a fair fight. Donnelly must have a two-foot advantage. That was ridiculous. Lebeau was more succinct: ""It was a jump on him."" Toronto from playoff picture ROUNDUP VANCOUVER The Los Angeles Kings are back in a big way. The Kings got four assists from Wayne Gretzky and brilliant netminding by Kelly Hrudey when they dismantled the Vancouver Canucks 6-1. Luc Robitaille led the Kings scorers with two goals, giving the left winger 44 for the season. Robitaille and Charlie Huddy scored power-play goals in the first period for the Kings as they stayed two points ahead of the Edmonton Oilers in the battle for second place in the Smythe Division and home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs. Gretzky was sent from the ice in the third period by referee Kerry Fraser for his persistent whining. Gretzky received two minutes for unsportsmanlike conduct and a 10-minute misconduct.

The crowd appeared to be more in the range of 6,500, which would be the second smallest in Whalers history. BOSTON The Boston Bruins' smallest home crowd in four seasons watched Adam Oates's third-period goal give them a 1-1 tie with the Quebec Nordiques in the first post-strike game for both teams. Oates's 20th goal of the season at 4:14 of the third period offset Alexei Gusarov's fifth for Quebec with 4:21 left in the second. home with one season with the Canadiens, Svoboda always fashioned himself as somewhat of an offensive defenceman.

Default,329,"S and in the international market The Colours of My Father has already won a Genie, the Canadian equivalent of an Oscar for best short documentary. It is one of only four films nominated for an Oscar in the best short documentary section. Hundreds in competition, Elson said the nomination was a tribute to the independent documentary tradition and to Canadian film. Despite Canada's reputation for world-class documentaries, Elson was still surprised the Academy chose his film over hundreds in competition. ""It's such a Montreal film,"" he said. ""I was looking out the window early this morning at the snow piled up from last night's storm, and I thought of all the winter scenes in the film. Then I got a phone call from Joan Pennc-father, Pennc-father of the National Film Board, saying we had been nominated. I've been trying to stay on an even keel ever since."" The Colours of My Father: a Portrait of Sam Borenstein is available on videocassette from the National Film Board library, 1564 St. Denis St. Information: 283-4823. Fires of Kuwait, a co-production of Imax Corp and Black Sun Films, was nominated for best documentary feature. David Douglas, director of Fires of Kuwait, was elated: ""We're just thrilled that we're nominated,"" he said from L. THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1993. Myriam Bedard finally gets to unwind. Biathlon champion home - at least for a few days. DAVE STUBBS THE GAZETTE. Finally, almost a week late, Myriam Bedard is about to celebrate the fact she is the finest female biathlete in the world. Bedard captured the 7.5-kilometre world championship in Borovets, Bulgaria last Saturday, two days after having finished second in the gruelling 15-km race. She has been trying to find a sliver of time to enjoy the achievement ever since. ""There aren't a lot of places to celebrate in Bulgaria, so what could I do, dance in my room?"" Bedard joked yesterday. ""Most people celebrate with a drink, but I don't drink at all. Our team went to a bar on Saturday and my celebration ended up being a pizza, not a very good one with cucumber on it."" Her flight home on Tuesday was delayed out of Frankfurt and a late arrival at Mirabel, coupled with that evening's snowstorm, ruined any chance of enjoying Montreal's nightlife. And Bedard scarcely had time to even catch her breath yesterday. She was feted at Montreal and Quebec City news conferences by Metropolitan Life, who presented her with a pair of plane tickets to Disney World, and was the special guest of Nordiques president Marcel Aubut at Le Colisee last night. This morning she will do television interviews with CTV and Radio-Canada. ""After that I'm going to unplug my phone and spend some quiet time at home (in Loretteville) and with my family,"" she said. ""We're going out for a nice dinner together so I can finally celebrate. Then I want to watch some movies, eat, sleep and relax."" The visit home is so brief she returns to Europe on Sunday. Bedard won't even reset her watch. She'll sleep only when tired and eat only when hungry in an attempt to ward off jetlag. Last week's world championships ended a brilliant and perfectly plotted first half of the season for Bedard, who leads the World Cup standings with three events to go. Her consistency through eight races in 1992-'93 has been remarkable; she has been in the top five six times. Bedard, 23, was knocking on victory's door two weeks before the worlds with finishes of second and fourth at a World Cup event in Antholz, Italy. Intense training then honed her to a razor-sharp edge, resulting in her splendid performance at Borovets. Bedard barely missed winning the 15-km race in Bulgaria, falling late in the event when she skied over a stone. That race, which she coughed her way through thanks to heavily polluted air, only fortified her resolve for the 7.5-km sprint. ""I didn't have a good race in the 15-km but I still finished second,"" Bedard said, ""and when I phoned Jean-Marc St. Pierre, of Met Life, I told him, 'Next time I'll do better.' And she did. Bedard shot a perfect 10 for 10 on the range; she was 19 for 20 in the 15-km to win the sprint by nearly 17 seconds. ""I had a vision, I felt like I was flying in the sprint,"" she said. ""I was so aggressive, so focused, that if anything got in my way I would have skied right over it. It was my race."" While Bedard already has achieved her season's goal with a world title, she knows the importance of the next World Cup stop March 4-7 in Lillehammer, Norway, where she'll compete on the 1994 Olympic course. ""I'm taking my (video) camera to see it all,"" she said. ""I hope to get out on the course on a Ski-Doo and record every inch of it, to study it during the summer and prepare myself for the Olympics. But for the next few days,"" Bedard said with a happy sigh, ""no biathlon. I left my rifle and skis in Europe.""

Young then scored twice and Dave Reid banged in another in a second period dominated by the Bruins. Reid also added the third period's only goal. In other words, no contest against a Canadiens team which had gone into the game with a 5-0-1 streak and high hopes of adding to a nine-point margin it had built on the Bruins. Instead, the Canadiens made it amply clear that there are still wrinkles which need ironing. What, for example, was the Canadiens defence doing while the Bruins were leaping happily on rebounds for goals? They simply reached in, got just the right piece of the puck, and thank you very much. Where was the beef? Team Clinic, maybe? It's true, no doubt, that goal-tenders such as Patrick Roy don't normally allow as many rebounds as he did last night. On the other hand, how can so many players clear so few rebounds? Could it be, perhaps, that much too much of the Canadiens energy went thataway after a late first-period, on-ice brawl which had all of the players, other than the goaltenders, involved in varying degrees? Not surprisingly, the Canadiens heavyweights were Todd Ewen and Mario Roberge. In the Bruins corners: Glen Featherstone and Brent Hughes. Four banished. At one point, everybody on the ice was involved, and when it was over, Roberge, an easy winner over Hughes, and Hallcr, a solid loser to Darin Kimble, were gone. So were Hughes and Kimble. Somehow, Ewen and Featherstone were allowed to remain in the game for which Bruins management may be forever grateful to referee Ron Hog-garth. The reason: Featherstone, along with a lot of his friends, was a formidable figure for the Bruins when they dominated the second and third periods. Dominated as in outworked, outmuscled, outgoaled and outsmarted. The Ottawa Senators visit on Saturday. Lemieux in happy mood at practice. ASSOCIATED PRESS PITTSBURGH. Radiation therapy can tire some patients. It doesn't seem to have tired Mario Lemieux, who practiced Tuesday with the Pittsburgh Penguins for the second time in a week. Lemieux declined to be interviewed, but laughed and joked with reporters and fellow players. Teammates' less-than-expert medical opinions were favorable. ""To see him out there and see him looking so good out there, you start thinking in your mind that: 'Hey, the day his radiation ends is the day he's going to be suiting up,'"" Joe Mullen said. When Lemieux was diagnosed last month with Hodgkin's disease, doctors said the radiation treatments could drain the 27-year-old's energy. ""I don't think it's going to take him long; this isn't like an injury,"" coach Scotty Bowman said. Tom Barrasso said skating, too, is therapy for Lemieux. ""The biggest therapeutic part of it is just being with us and having some sense of normalcy in his life,"" he said. PAT HICKEY Bedard triggers biathlon boom. Timing is an important element in sport and, when considering the career of biathlete Myriam Bedard, it has been crucial. Bedard is the latest in a series of Canadian Wonder Women who have struck gold on the international stage by winning the world championship last week in Borovets, Bulgaria. But she is also an object lesson in the folly of a proposed Sport Canada policy regarding the emphasis our government places on amateur sport. Under the proposed policy, the majority of government funding would go to so-called ""core sports."" These would be sports in which Canada has a long-standing record of competition, as well as a good track record. Thanks to Bedard, biathlon would rate as a core sport if the designation were applied today. But it would have been a different matter if the designation had been applied five years ago when Bedard was a mere novice in this sport, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. ""I'm not aware of this policy,"" Bedard said as she dropped into Montreal on the first leg of a rest session which had turned into a media opportunity. ""But it doesn't sound like a good idea. I think everybody should have an opportunity."" For example, I know athletes on the luge team and they're not doing that well but I have a lot of respect for the time and effort they put into the sport. And in our sport, we have teams from Japan, Korea and China. They aren't very good but they're competing and doing their best. Canadian team lags behind. Bedard can appreciate that because she has been there. In fact, she says the rest of the Canadian team is still there. ""I've left them behind,"" she says of her relationship with Biathlon Canada, the governing body for the sport in this country. The relationship was at its stormiest two years ago when she was battling for the overall World Cup lead. The biathlon people wanted her to return from Europe for the Canadian championships; she wanted to compete in a World Cup race. ""Today, they let me make my own schedule,"" said Bedard, who has her own personal coach as well as people who advise her about waxing her skis. Bedard says one of the reasons why opportunities should be open to young athletes is that the Canadian sports environment is unique. ""Many top athletes make it on an individual basis,"" said Bedard. ""In Canada, we don't have great numbers and we tend to develop athletes on their own. Look at Gaetan Boucher or Pierre Harvey. They didn't have people around them at the same level. They made it by themselves."" But Bedard's success may be part of a biathlon boom in Quebec. Antoine Ste. Marie, who is the director of Ski Quebec, says the province has a strong grassroots program which involves more than 1,000 youngsters. And he says that Bedard is part of the reason. ""I think youngsters look up to her,"" said Ste. Marie, who says the Quebec program has been going for 10 years. Bedard, who started shooting as an army cadet and didn't begin skiing until she was 15, is the star of the program. It's not the only starring role she plays these days. The host for yesterday's gathering and a second news conference in Quebec was Metropolitan Life, which is sponsoring Bedard through next winter's Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway. ""We think she's the ideal spokesman for us,"" said Met Life's Jean-Marc St. Pierre, who jumped on the Bedard bandwagon last year after she won a bronze medal at the winter Games in Albertville. ""She's obviously a great athlete but she also speaks well in both languages and she is attractive."" St. Pierre said this is the company's first venture with a sports figure and, while the early emphasis has been on the Quebec market, the company's major spokespersons outside Quebec are Charlie Brown and the gang from the comic strip Peanuts. He plans a major blitz after the current season is over. ""We want to spend a week in Toronto and hit all the other big cities across Canada,"" he said. ""We think she can be as big as Nancy Greene. She's not just a Quebec figure; she's a Canadian star, an international star."" Met Life is also sponsoring the Canadian biathlon championships for the next two years even though this year's event in Hinton, Alia, will be missing the sport's top star. ""We'd like Myriam to be there and she would give the event a higher profile,"" said St. Pierre. ""But there's a World Cup race in Sweden at the same time. If she does well here, it gives the sport a higher profile."" THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1993. Toxic-waste depot for Chateauguay might be allowed. DEBBIE PARKES THE GAZETTE. CHATEAUGUAY - Hydro-Quebec might not have as hard a time setting up a toxic-waste storage site in this city as Mayor Jean-Bosco Bourcier has suggested. In the past, Hydro has only been required to ensure that such sites are 100 metres - not 300 metres - from food-processing plants, Sylvie Marier, an aide to Environment Minister Pierre Paradis confirmed this week. This suggests that even though Aliments Plasse Inc. plans to move into a building next door - a move city officials said effectively blocked Hydro's plan - the utility will still be able to set up a toxic-waste storage site at its administrative centre. Legal opinion in a month. Marier said she's asked for a legal opinion, but said it would take about a month. She said the fact that Hydro obtained previous authorization certificates under Article 17 of the province's regulation on hazardous wastes has created a precedent. While one article of the province's regulation on hazardous wastes stipulates that ""transfer centres"" must be at least 300 metres from food-processing plants, another one, Article 17, says ""new producers"" of toxic waste need only be 100 metres away. Plan drew criticism. Helene Wilson, head of the environment team for Hydro's Richelieu region, said the utility has always fallen under that category. Hydro, which opened its administrative centre last year, advised the municipality in July that it wants to build a storage site on the same property. The plan drew criticism from people like Debbie Robertson, president of the Chateauguay Environment Committee, at council meetings. That's when Bourcier claimed Hydro's project couldn't go ahead because of the Environment Department regulations. At its farthest point, there are 280 metres between Hydro's property and the Aliments Plasse building going up next door, a city permits-department employee said. Snowstorm and warning keeps crowd from St. Hubert meeting. ST. HUBERT - Blame it on the anticipated snowstorm but in the end, there were no marauding crowds at Tuesday's council meeting - just a healthy 80-person turnout. Marcel Frechette, secretary of the Rassemblement des Citoyens et Citoyennes de St. Hubert, said two factors probably led to the lower-than-expected showing. First, the approximately 400 people that attended the meeting two weeks ago in a school hall had been forewarned that this regular meeting at city hall could only seat 85 of them. Second, well, the weather. ""Given the snowstorm, I don't think very many people were interested in remaining outside,"" city spokesman Lise Hosson said. She said council will have a better idea next month as to whether the reduced crowd was at all due to waning public interest, since March's meetings are scheduled for the 500-seat meeting hall at Polyvalente Andre Laurendeau. Turnouts at council meetings have run as high as 500 people since December after the Rassemblement began campaigning for a freeze on taxes and against considerable salary increases for council members. The municipality had hoped to find a local school for Tuesday's meeting, but none could be had without cancelling regular recreation activities, Hosson said. GAZETTE, DAVE SIDAWAY. Jean-Paul Brenn lives in a Chambly home built in 1815 for a military officer. It was declared a monument in 1985. Chambly man wins heritage award. He persuaded town to turn old factory into library. DEBBIE PARKES THE GAZETTE. CHAMBLY - When Jean-Paul Brenn arrived here from his native France 26 years ago, he was saddened by the number of old buildings falling into disrepair. But Brenn did more than lament. That is why he was honored Monday with an Environment Canada heritage award, presented in Winnipeg. Among his accomplishments, he spearheaded a fundraising drive seven years ago to raise $500,000 to renovate Chambly's St. Stephen's Anglican Church. In 1988, when the town bought an old factory by the Chambly basin on the Richelieu River, he persuaded council to turn it into a municipal library. The town had wanted to tear the building down to improve the view of the waterfront. Now, as a library, ""it's considered a little jewel, really,"" town manager Michel Merleau said. ""It's a very active milieu thanks to that guy."" Besides storing books, the library also plays host to regular exhibits. And two summers ago, the city turned the area outside into a park - Le Jardin de la Paix - where concerts are held during the summer. For Brenn, a 47-year-old animal-feed supplier, old buildings are not just for visiting - he lives in one. It's the Thomas Whitehead house, built in 1815 for a military officer at Fort Chambly. Brenn bought it in 1980 and got the province to declare it a historical monument in 1985. The following year, he put in $200,000 of renovations. Quebec paid about $50,000 of the cost. An old house is a lot more than a home, Brenn said. ""It's also history; You can discover how others lived."" Brenn was lucky. He found old inventories that tell what was kept around the house. As well, he found the building contract, the masonry contract and all the title deeds. The Whitehead house is one of several Brenn has helped to restore. In 1973, he worked on an old home belonging to his sister-in-law and worked on a few more for friends in the following years. In 1976, he bought his first old home, in nearby St. Pie de Bagot. If anything, his work has helped to promote the importance of Chambly's heritage, he said. No doubt about it, Merleau said. In fact, Chambly has consulted Brenn several times on what it should do with certain buildings. And about six years ago, he founded the Chambly tourism bureau, which promotes the region's heritage. Longueuil credit union to close. KARYET SHEPHERD THE GAZETTE. LONGUEUIL - Steps have been taken to permanently shut down a financially troubled caisse populaire where employees have been locked out for nine months. The Federation des Caisses Populaires Desjardins de Montreal et de l'Ouest du Quebec announced Monday it has asked Quebec's inspector-general of financial institutions to begin liquidation procedures. Despite the lockout, the Caisse Populaire de Lyon in southern Longueuil has been kept open with reduced hours by managers. The 16 employees, mostly tellers, at the 3036 Chambly Rd. caisse were locked out in June during a dispute over working hours. Francois Aubin, a federation vice-president, said the caisse could remain in operation for weeks or months, depending on the inspector-general's office. The federation said deposits and other assets of caisse members remain fully protected. All promises, including interest-rate deals, made to members will be respected. Members will receive a statement of the caisse's financial situation. And they will be told how they can move their accounts to other Desjardins branches in Longueuil and the South Shore. Real St. Pierre, a negotiator for Local 57 of the Professional and Office Employees Union, said the employees were locked out after refusing to work weekends and office hours not provided for in the previous collective agreement. He said the caisse made the dispute worse by reducing wage offers on the table. The caisse has been offering a three-year agreement with annual increases of 3 per cent. St. Pierre said employees had previously been offered 5 per cent. He said the caisse is in financial trouble because of several years of mismanagement, especially a move some time ago to a location too costly for a small caisse. The federation of caisses said it has decided to begin liquidation procedures after directors of the local caisse advised the federation that ""persistent financial difficulties, aggravated by a labor contract of more than eight months,"" left them unable to start a recovery program.

With only months until a federal election, the Bloc Quebecois and Reform Party are falling like stones in public opinion, a new Gallup poll shows. In Quebec, only 16 per cent of voters say they support the Bloc Quebecois, down sharply from 30 per cent of voters in a Gallup poll in January. Support for the Bloc stood at 32 per cent a year ago and 23 per cent two years ago. Jean Chretien's Liberals are in the lead in Quebec with 49 per cent, up eight percentage points, while Brian Mulroney's Conservatives are holding steady at 21 per cent. The NDP is supported by 11 per cent. In a surprising new trend, Gallup reports that 23 per cent of Quebecers say they'll abstain from voting in the next federal election. Gallup analyst Andrl Turcotte said last night that the number of Quebecers who say they'll abstain has been growing steadily in recent months. He said the abstainers are in addition to the 30 per cent of Quebecers who say they're undecided. In the West, support among decided voters for the Reform Party has slipped about five percentage points and now stands at 17 per cent in Alberta and 16 per cent in British Columbia, third place in both provinces. Nationally, support for the Liberals remains strong at 49 per cent while support for the Tories has edged up by two percentage points to 21 per cent. The New Democrats are in third place with 16 per cent of the decided vote. Thirty-four per cent of Canadians are undecided, up from 31 percent last month. Mulroney must call an election this year. The poll results are based on 2,017 telephone interviews Feb. 4-15. A national sample of this size is accurate within 2.2 percentage points, 19 in 20 times.

Default,330,"K I RTT ELECTION A large meeting in the interests of Mr Donald A Smith was held last week in the city of Winnipeg From the speeches it is evident that whatever may be the result of the elections, the late Government cannot boast of many ardent admirers in the province Through all the speeches the plea of independence was put forward as the platform upon which Mr Smith stands Mr Killam, for instance, who made the first speech on behalf of Mr Smith, admitted that many found fault with the present Government for their policy towards this country Ottawa was a long way off and down there they didn't understand our wants as well as we did here And then with a view, if possible, of securing some Conservative votes for Mr Smith, this particular form of argument was presented: if any one present desired the present Government to remain in power, it was his duty to show the Government what they should do to command our confidence Mr TTiUaTrt, like the Grit speakers generally, was not very accurate in his statements For instance, referring to the railway, he said: Since Mr Mackenzie went out of power only two hundred miles had been put under contract, and they all knew what had become of the first hundred miles As a matter of fact, one hundred and eighty miles were put under contract to complete the missing link between Thunder Bay and Selkirk, without which all the expenditure between these two points was useless Mr Smith himself took substantially the same view of the land regulations that the Gazette has taken He said: Very many settlers were not satisfied with 160 or 320 acres of land, but very properly desired to have a larger quantity And yet we have the announcement of the Globe that its special condemnation of the land regulations is that people can get more than three hundred and twenty acres, and that they should be so amended as to restrict settlers to that quantity Mr Smith too, indulged in some inaccuracies He said: He would for a moment compare the terms offered on the two sides of the line Where the price demanded here is $1 an acre, on the American side it is $2 per acre As a matter of fact, this statement is untrue There is a five-mile belt on the Canadian side at $5 an acre, and then a fifteen-mile belt next to that at $10, that is to actual settlers, while in the United States the land within twenty miles of the railways is all held at $10 an acre, and Mr Smith himself is holding his own alternate twenty-mile sections on the St Paul, Manitoba, Minneapolis Railway, at $10 and over, these alternate sections covering a very much larger area than the five-mile belt on the Canadian Pacific As a matter of fact the railway lands in the United States, which cover an average of ten miles on each side of the railways, have been sold at a price averaging very nearly $5 an acre It is too bad that Mr Smith, because he happens to have a lot of land for sale in the United States, should misstate the land regulations and the comparison which they bear to those of the neighboring republic Mr Smith was most particular to avoid declaring himself as a candidate of the Opposition On the contrary, his position is that of an independent determined to vote according to his view of the interests of the country, no matter what Government happens to be in power The late William Lyon Mackenzie, who was a true student of human nature, may well be your independent update has written on his forehead We do not say that of Mr Smith; but we do say that he has been mighty particular since he has been in public life, to be on that side upon which he thought his bread was buttered What the result of the election may be it is difficult to say It is quite clear that the Opposition have no hope whatever of carrying the constituency on party grounds In fact their only hope of success is, in what they are pleased to assume, the disaffection in the Conservative ranks in relation to the candidate, Captain Scott Our information is, too, however, that, in spite of all these hopes, Captain Scott will be elected by a majority MINERALS APPLICABLE TO THE FINE ARTS OR TO JEWELLERY The tenth class is that of minerals applicable to the fine arts or to jewellery Chief among those comprehended under the former part of this description is lithographic stone To deserve this name the limestone must be fine-grained and compact Beds having these characters are found between Hungerford and Rama on Lake Couchiching That of the township of Marmora yields the best, and the stones taken thence have given satisfaction to some of the most fastidious lithographers The band in which it occurs may be traced for a hundred miles, so that there is little fear of its making default for some time to come A stone was sent to Philadelphia in 1876 which presented facsimile autographs of all the Governors of Canada, except two French ones, from the time of Champlain to that of Lord Monck Repeated attempts have been made to quarry the stone and introduce it to the market, but they had been made in vain, at least as late as three or four years ago Among the dolomites of the Onondaga formation in the township of Brant, there is a fine-grained, yellowish-grey stone, which is said to be well fitted for lithographic purposes The locality is quite close to the village of Walkerton Specimens were recently exhibited with various impressions At Oxbow, on the Sangeen, specimens equally good have been obtained Porphyry is of sufficient occurrence in the pre-Silurian rocks of Canada to make it worthwhile to turn it to economic use A fine example of a crimson-black porphyry occurs in Grenville, Quebec;

in other cases it occurs without admixture Perthite is a reddish orthoclase, a species of feldspar which is a constituent of granite, syenite, etc., and abounds in the Laurentian rocks The bands with which it is barred give out beautiful golden reflections The jasper conglomerate is admirably adapted for vases It is found in the Bruce Mines on Lake Huron Labradorite is an opalescent mineral and also makes beautiful vases Great masses of it are found in Abercrombie, Terrebonne county, and boulders, severed from there, are scattered over the plains farther south The amethystine quartz is well fitted for ornament It is found around Thunder Bay Already masses of it have been taken away, but there is still no lack to those who open new veins or follow the old ones The agates occur on the north and south shores of Lake Superior, especially on the Simpson and St Ignace islands, but the largest and best are found on Michipicoten Island, where they strew the shores in abundance, appearing as nodules in the trap, and in veins traversing it in all directions Box 1978 ALL THUNDER BAY SILVER MINING CO NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN THAT FROM QUEBEC Bacing party on the steamship Personal Sona Citizens' Hall Obit Atlanta ftuMl CSSMrt Quebec, September 6 Vice-Admiral Sir Leopold McClintock, Captain Fisher and the officers of Her Majesty's ship Northampton have issued cards for a dancing party on board the flagship on Wednesday afternoon Mr Weston Hunt arrived in town from Europe today Mr Phillip Landry, MP, and Dr Landry are in town The Bishop of Nova Scotia preached at the Cathedral yesterday morning and at St Matthews in the evening A very violent storm of thunder and lightning, accompanied by torrents of rain, broke out over the city shortly after midnight last night In consequence of the ball to be given by the citizens of Quebec to the officers of Her Majesty's ships How in port on Thursday night, Admiral Sir Leopold McClintock has given instructions for the vessels to remain here a day longer than was originally intended Mr Chas Henry, Inspector of the Quebec Bank, died here on Saturday evening The dramatic entertainment by the sailors of the flagship Northampton for the benefit of the Atlanta widows and orphans' relief fund, came off at the Music Hall tonight before a crowded house The acting was good, and the fine band of the ship added greatly to the evening enjoyment With regard to the rumor telegraphed here on Saturday to the effect that the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario declined to invite Lieutenant-Governor Bobitaille to Toronto during the coming exhibition, the Morning Chronicle says today: Not only did Lieutenant-Governor Robinson send an invitation to Lieut-Gov Bobitaille, but Mrs Robinson also specially invited Madame Bobitaille to be her guest on the occasion The utmost good feeling prevails among both the Lieutenant-Governors of the sister provinces FROM TOKU P Wilor Co and the law office of O'Kerill & Beston and thence went northeast taking Porter & Co's hardware store, water sewer, Masara's hardware store, Morris's produce warehouse, and ascending St Michael street destroyed F Gomez's tinware manufactory and the large warehouse of Porter & Co The stock of Bidgood & Co, stationer, Eastburn, bookbindery, H Farrew & Co, printers, Thomson & Powers, printers, and W Goodai, produce merchant, were considerably damaged The loss is estimated at $350,000, about two-thirds of which is covered by insurance LATEST SHIPPING NEWS New York, September 6 Arrived: Anchoria Iron sailing Pr: irETJTtiA, September 6 Arrived: H fr from Liverpool September 6 Arrived: Ameriqne from New York September 6 Arrived: from New Wrlc for Honduras West point September 6 Arrived: City of Hoi r-rKl er'jini;

ANNE STREET. In matter, philosophy was, for obvious reasons, an unsafe and uncertain, an impractical guide; Religion or Divine philosophy alone seemed to lead our inquiries to a more satisfactory result. As regards man, the description in Scripture of his original design represented him as worthy of his high original, but fallen therefrom. This whole account was reflected in the various traditions of the nations of the world, and embodied, though distorted, in its religious systems. The present attempts to supersede or set aside the religious history of mankind were marked with mischievous consequences, and was itself exceedingly unreasonable. The whole course of history refuted the figment of man raising himself by slow degrees to the conception of a Supreme Being. As far back as we could trace, the earliest ideas of man led to the diligent study of the heavenly bodies, and a dealer in cigars in New York City. What a strange freak of fortune! Here were two men, who, but a few weeks before, occupied the attention of the world while engaged in their sublime efforts to secure freedom for their downtrodden country, now earning their bread in a foreign country by daily labor. Accompanied by Avezzanco, I went to the candle factory on Staten Island, where we found Garibaldi with his shirt sleeves rolled up, dipping wicks attached to small things. CHAPTER XXV ""And to be wroth with one we love both work like madness in the brain,"" Coleridge. Just two hours before this, in Richmond, the storm so long expected has broken forth in all its fury. Great flashes of blinding lightning intermingled with the grand roar of the thunder from on high; while ever and anon the passionate bursts of rain flung themselves against the window panes of the hotel, almost drowning the gay laughter and merry voices of those within, where Blunden and Fancy Charteris and Laura Redesdale (who had gone down there at the last moment, having been persuaded thereto by Fancy and all the others) were holding high revelry. But when the hour for departure came and the storm still raged, all the gentler members of the party declined to brave the elements; and indeed driving was found to be utterly out of the question; so Sir John and Fancy and Laura Redesdale started together to catch the train, while Lads Inman and her husband, and two or three others, threw in their lot together and remained at the hotel until the following day. Now, as it so happened, Arthur Blunden came up to town that night by the same train, being unwilling to spend another hour outside the place that held his heart's idol; and as he stepped from his carriage on his arrival at the station, he saw, walking just before him, two figures, both so familiar, and one so bound up with every loudest thought of his heart, that he stopped short to contemplate them more at his leisure. As he stared, unwilling to believe his own eyes, a merry sweet infectious laugh rang upon the air, a laugh he knew well alas! too well one that he had often echoed through very sympathy with its mirth, but that now falling on his ears made him shrink and pale, and brought his teeth down sharply on his under lip. The possessor of the gay laugh is Fancy; her companion is Sir John Blunden. Laura Redesdale, who has run on before to her carriage (having telegraphed for it), is out of sight; so that Arthur, knowing nothing of that dinner at Richmond, sees only the woman he loves alone at eleven o'clock at night with the man he has long deemed his rival, and, with a brain on fire and a heart desolate, tells himself with a desperate certainty that surely she is false to him, and inconstant beyond belief. He makes a step forward, as though suddenly filled with a wild desire to take her from his rival. They were cordially received by the general. They were republican refugees from Italy, Germany, and South America. The conversation was principally upon Italian affairs, and it was pleasant to observe the profound respect which all present paid to Garibaldi, who was the central figure of the group of fiery republicans in the room. General Garibaldi was at that time about forty-three years of age, of medium height, large head with noble brow, his eyes bluish gray, with a keen, intelligent and kindly expression, his hair dark brown, whiskers inclined to reddish, feet and hands small and well-formed. He was cool and self-possessed in his manner, his voice low and musical in tone, his language concise and to the point. He spoke the French, Spanish, and Italian languages with ease and fluency, and English indifferently. He wore dark trousers and a red flannel shirt, and over this, when the weather required additional covering, a heavy white cloak or poncho lined with red flannel. During the General's residence in America I spent many hours in his company, charmed by his simple, unaffected manner and kind disposition as much as by his grand character and heroic services in behalf of freedom. His candle business did not prosper, and he determined to go to California, which at the time was attracting thousands of adventurers to its gold mines. When he arrived on the Pacific Coast he found he could not obtain the employment he expected, and engaged as captain of a Peruvian vessel on a voyage to China. He afterwards made many trips to New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston. On the occasion of his visit to Boston, in 1853, as captain of the ship Carmen, I again met him. He had not changed much in appearance, except that his face and hands were bronzed by exposure. He was the same mild gentleman, his voice as sweet and musical as when I first met him in 1850. During his short stay in Boston I frequently met him, and listened to his modest recital of incidents personal to his wonderful career. When I clasped his hand for the last time as he was about sailing for Italy, he said: ""If you are ever blessed with a son, do me the favor of giving him my name, and may it be a good augury for him."" And when in course of time his wish was complied with, he sent my little boy the following letter: To my precious godson, Garibaldi Ross: My dearest, I think of you constantly, and hope you will grow up a brave and good man. Remember that time is money, and to waste it is a crime. Embrace with ardor and steadfastness sound and liberal principles. I send you an affectionate embrace and a father's wish for your future happiness. Yours devotedly for life, G. Garibaldi, Caprera, October 10th, 1873. On each succeeding birthday the general has sent affectionate words of congratulation and kind wishes for his godson. In 1874 an Italian friend wrote me that Garibaldi was extremely poor, in fact often without the necessaries of life. I at once wrote to the home marks of high culture and of strong religious tendencies. In conclusion, the author considered that the early destinies of man foreshadowed the completion of his history.",1,18810117,historical,thunder,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Mr. James Scullion, of the Montreal club, was appointed referee, and he acted with judgment in giving his decisions when the quoits were lying almost a tie. The following is the result of the match: Dominion, Perry, J. Stewart, W. Marsh; Montreal, Triplett, H. Williams, J. Oram, H. Halioy, C. says Bergt-Major Loke, of the Northwest Mounted Police, now in camp at Golden, suicided yesterday morning by shooting himself. He complained of a severe attack of neuralgia and retired at night as usual. Early in the morning one of his comrades heard a pistol shot. He got up and went into the sergeant's tent and found him dead, the bullet having passed through the front part of his head, entered the right temple, and came out at the left. Three sisters of charity have arrived from Montreal and will go west to Lac La Biche, a distant Hudson Bay post. The Rev. Hugh Johnston, of Toronto, preached to a large audience in Grace Church tonight. A WILFUL MURDER, Alunvobd, Ont., July 9 A great sensation was created here yesterday by the cold-blooded murder of Carrie McDougall, widow of the late Archibald McDougall. The murder was committed about 2 p.m. by a man by the name of Samuel Hughes and a neighbor. Two bullets entered her right breast, causing death almost instantly. Hughes shot himself, but not fatally. He is now lodged in Walkerton. The verdict of the coroner's jury is ""Premeditated murder by Samuel Hughes."" Jealousy is alleged to have been the cause of the rash act. THEN CAME A SCENE that must have thrilled all present, whether there as Dr. McGlynn's adherents or as curiosity seekers. As the deposed priest was first recognized by those nearest the stage there went up a sharp shout of welcome and recognition. The recognition spread like a flash, the shout grew to a clamor and the cheer to applause that swelled and echoed and billowed until nearly 4,000 persons were upon their feet and a thunderous roar went out to those in the streets and was there taken up and spread to Irving Hall and the word went through the multitudes that Dr. McGlynn was before the people and that he was even then waiting a pause in their applause to begin his speaking, the first in public since the bolt from Home had fallen upon him, and when the roar of voices had sunk away to a murmur a voice from one of the balconies shouted in clear tones, ""THEY'LL HEAR THIS IN ROME,"" and the interjection was cheered, and the shout was taken up and grew until the building trembled with the din. But at length, after ten minutes, the people had become wearied with the excess of the enthusiasm, and the air grew still. Chairman Gaban, before introducing Dr. McGlynn, said, ""As I look about on this great audience I am more than ever convinced that the most idolized man in America today is Dr. McGlynn. The country I came from is generally credited with being a manufactory of fools. I hope in future that business will be removed to Italy. We are here tonight to let Rome know that in matters political not one jot of our allegiance is rendered to any power or potentate, but in its entirety is given to the laws and constitution of the United States."" (Cheers) ""All of you went to your several churches this morning. In not one church have I changed my style, but because the times require it."" (Cheers) ""I am compelled to speak as I do to show you the difference between faith and reverence, to teach you the difference between the falsehood, crimes, and chicaneries of a mere ecclesiastical machine and that ideal church of which Christ is the sponsor and the master. We must learn to distinguish between men and Christ, the reverence due to an authority which edifies and a mere machine. It is a notorious fact that religion is vanishing fast from among us, that in Roman Catholic countries we find a bitter hatred of religion and the Pope in a marked degree that is not to be seen elsewhere. Here in America if a Catholic priest only knows how to behave himself half like a gentleman, he is honored and respected as much on his own account as for being a moral force in the community. Even those differing from him in religion are proud of his friendship and are glad to have his influence, but go into a so-called Roman Catholic country and a priest is hated even to his gown and collar. He is shunned and avoided and people flee his presence. It is because they hate him, not because they revere him. If you want to see TRUE DEVOTION TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH go where it is in a minority and with little power, as in Ireland and Germany. As long as Catholics continue to let the Pope do as he pleases in politics as well as in religion, allowing Cardinals to be elected to the assemblies and daring to forbid an American priest from making any political speeches, or attending any political meeting in future without the permission of the Propaganda, which thinks that Florida is a suburb of New York and Mobile a street in San Francisco, so long as such is allowed, so long will the Irish, German, and American poor be sold out for any price that Rome can get in return. THE PAPACY IS A MACHINE with nothing but the cupidity and lust for money and power, and it is the knowledge of this condition of things that has ruined all Catholic countries and plunged them into atheism. Dr. McGlynn said a report had been published that the Archbishop had sent him a registered letter containing notice of his (McGlynn's) excommunication. He had received notice of such postal service and had given it to a friend in order to get it, but up to this morning he had not received it. Hence he went to church this morning, receiving communion at mass with as much devotion as possible and then Dr. McGlynn closed with these words: ""Well, Dr. McGlynn, what are you going to do about it? To be continued in the next chapter."" Then Henry George and others closed the meeting. Maxwell II list Hagar, St. Louis, July 9 The attorneys of Maxwell, the murderer of Preller, have abandoned his case and he will doubtless be hanged on August 28. I CjUcth E, aedy, Bkbmn, July 9 If the temper of the German press were a faithful reflection of the disposition of the Government a war with France would be a question of a few days. The revelations at the Klein trial, the French tax on foreigners which is openly designed to affect Germans, and the prohibitive import on German spirits have the combined effect of incensing the people to the utmost. The latter measures by themselves have been held of less account, but associated with the spy trials they have heightened the general sense that French enmity is implacable and that it seeks to wound the Germans where it can, waiting a chance to inflict the deadliest injury. The trial of Klein is the fifth treason trial in which clear proof was afforded that the French war ministry has organized a system of espionage. A worse case than any revealed is under enquiry. An employee of the central administration at Strasbourg is about to be tried at Leipzig. He is charged with selling to the French war office all of the official reports sent to the chief administrator of Alsace by his various subordinates. The completeness of this system of espionage suggests that treason is still at work and that any moment may bring further revelations. Official irritation equals that of the public. The Work of Eviction, Derry, July 9 In the evictions at Coolgrany, county Wexford, today a man named Harney and his three daughters made such a stubborn defense of their house against the bailiffs, who attempted to eject them, that the officers in their anger attacked the girls and badly injured one of them on the head. Three of the bailiffs will be arrested and charged with assault. In the next house a tenant and his wife made considerable resistance, but they were put out and then arrested for scalding the police with hot water. What the Times London, July 9 An article published in today's Times calls the attention of that paper to what the writer declares to be the fact that its articles on ""Parnellism and Crime"" have seriously perturbed the Parnellites and their allies in America, particularly the Irish World. The writer says the issue of the Irish World of June 18 shows that Patrick Ford's London correspondent has shrunk away owing to the imminence of Coercion. The Anarchist Trials, Berlin, July 9 The great Anarchist trial, involving Socialists of Hamburg, Berlin, and Leipzig, will begin here on the 15th inst., before the Imperial tribunal. The case of Brueckner and others charged with treason, which has been under enquiry at Strasbourg, has been transferred to Leipzig and will be tried on the 25th inst.

Mapleson's management. A French Murder Trial, Paris, July 9 Pranzini, the murderer of Mme. Kigueault, her maid, and the latter's child, was placed on trial today. The prisoner denied his guilt. The courtroom was crowded with ladies and celebrities. Pranzini's demeanor was calm and collected. He defends himself and today conducted his defense in an able manner. Thank Goodness! London, July 9 David Debeszyjd, husband of Violet Cameron, the actress, had withdrawn the charges he made against Lord Lonsdale and the suit for divorce based on the charges. Miss Cameron has also withdrawn her petition for divorce, and both cases have been dismissed. Schnabel's Reward, Paris, July 9 Mr. Schnabel, the arrest of whom by German police came near being a casus belli between France and Germany, has been appointed to a higher position at Laon. He wanted to be again placed on the frontier, but this the Government refused to do. Killed by a Madman, Dublin, July 9 A madman today attacked a party of men making hay in a field near Rathfriland, county Down. The maniac was armed with a billhook, and he killed four men and wounded two. He then fled, and when captured was standing up to his chin in the water of a neighboring lake.

Default,335,"THE GAZETTE MONTREAL WEDNESDAY, MAY 1850 TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION Protestant Education in the Province of Quebec SUMMER SCHOOL SCHEME Taking Definitive Shape Satisfactory Reports from the Address by Sir William Dawson When the Teachers' Association of the McGill Normal School dispersed after the last annual meeting there is no record of anyone having asked the question: When shall we meet again? but when they assembled last evening for their twenty-seventh annual meeting it was undoubtedly ""Mid thunder, lightning, and rain."" The number of members who made an effort to be present was small, but, as the chairman, Mr. Kneeland, said, it was a respectable gathering. SHORE RAILWAY The Chambre de Commerce to Ascertain the General Feeling in Regard to It The sub-committee of the Chambre de Commerce who were appointed to agitate the question of the extension of the Intercolonial railway via the Great Eastern to Montreal met last evening. The result of their inquiries was that they resolved to send a series of questions to every village and every parish council on the route of the proposed line, and also to the parish priests to ascertain their views in regard to the proposed line, and also that they might find out the general feeling as to whether it was in favor of the proposed extension of the Intercolonial line from its present terminus at Pointe Levis to Montreal or a point opposite the city. After all answers to these inquiries are made, a report will be drafted to be laid before the whole of the members of the Chambre. The correspondence between the several boards of trade of the different cities and towns on the route of the line will be communicated and submitted to the board. From all documents gathered a memorial will be sent to all the members of the Federal parliament and also the Federal ministers, so that they can study the proposed south shore railway. It is also proposed that after those proceedings have taken place the delegates from all the municipalities on the proposed route of the line will be called to a public meeting under the patronage of the Chambre de Commerce, in a convenient town, and pass resolutions in support of the project. The sub-committee has found that the projected line would save a very considerable distance between the Atlantic Ocean and Montreal. It would be a great saving to the Government by giving them a short distance line to Montreal, through a rich country. Freights would be cheaper and merchants would benefit. A full printed report will be circulated. The Quebec Bridge The great bridge scheme is still engaging the thoughts of our Quebec confreres. Le Journal of that city, in referring to an interview which a deputation recently had with Sir Hector Langevin, said that it was believed that the engineers of the Government were shortly about to make the necessary topographic and hydrographic surveys, so as to ascertain the most effective and economical methods of construction. Le Journal advises the promoters of the scheme to be unwearied in their solicitations till they attain their object. A definite settlement of the question is, it urges, of the utmost importance to Quebec. The iniquitous and unjust system of consular protection at Tangier, which enables any foreign national to place himself outside of the local police authority, was lately the cause of a scandalous affair. The Austrian legation was entered and several houses robbed with impunity. The young ladies lay screaming in bed for help, and saw the bandits stealing all their trinkets. No help is in sight, since the police dare not touch a foreigner without an order from the consulate of the national's nationality. SAVONAROLA, THE PROPHET The Founder of the First Democratic Constitution An Interesting Account of His Life by Prof. Davidson of New York Savonarola, the Prophet, was the title of a most interesting lecture delivered by Prof. Thomas Davidson, of New York, under the auspices of the University Literary Society. The rain was pouring in torrents and a thunderstorm raging so that it is little wonder that the Fraser Institute hall, where the lecture was delivered, was half empty. Dr. Murray occupied the chair and introduced the lecturer. Prof. Davidson commenced by a reference to the death of Dante after having moulded the whole spiritual movement of antiquity into a great mystic poem, ""to which heaven and earth put a hand,"" and having lashed the growing corruption of church and state. He had been a quarter of a century in his grave when there sprang up to deliver his message a woman who seemed as if she were the incarnate spirit of Beatrice, who in heaven fulminated against the corruptions of the church. This was the peasant girl of Siena, Catherine Benincasa, the most remarkable woman that Europe ever produced. She died at the age of 33, and at the same time there arose in Germany the mystic movement headed by Meister Eckhart and John Tauler, the founder of German philosophy. Similar movements arose in Holland and elsewhere, but the mightiest practical outburst of spiritual thought and life, seeking to clothe them in human institutions, took place in Italy. If Catherine Benincasa was the reincarnated Beatrice, Girolamo Savonarola was the reincarnated Dante. The condition of Italy at the time was one almost of anarchy; city was contending against city, and family against family for supremacy, and the ambition of the Popes and the Kings of France and Spain, each of whom was attempting to gain a footing in Italy, helped to keep the country in a turmoil. Added to this were the troubles within the church which went so far that at one time there were no less than three Popes all claiming the Roman See. Last but not least, was the influence of the East of pagan learning. Such was the state of affairs when Savonarola was born in 1452 at Ferrara. Being of a frail constitution he was allowed to remain at home till he was 21 years of age and he was probably self-taught. Ferrara was at that time a city of 200,000 inhabitants and the seat of pagan splendor and pagan morals. Savonarola fell in love with a natural daughter of the haughty and aristocratic Strozzi, but was given to understand that she was of different flesh and blood from him. He hurled back the insult in their teeth and was done with the world forever. One day when a church festival left him alone in the house he quietly slipped away to Bologna, thirty-six miles away, where he entered a monastery. In a letter to his parents he expressed the belief that Christ had chosen him for his militant knight. Church and State were alike corrupt, and Savonarola believed himself called to reform them. In 1484, being sent out to preach in country towns, he aroused the people by his fierce denunciations of corruptions and his prophecies of coming judgment. His remarkable prophecies were all fulfilled. He was made prior of San Marco, and Lorenzo endeavored to conciliate him with rich gifts but the monk turned them over to the poor and ignored the donor. When Lorenzo was on his deathbed he sent for Savonarola, and the latter promised him absolution on condition that he would restore all property wrongly confiscated, remit all punishments wrongly imposed, and restore to Florence her liberty. The dying man refused the last, and Savonarola walked away. Savonarola once more evinced his independence when he tore up the ultimatum of Charles VIII of France, but it took all his diplomacy to get the French out of Florence. Then he and his friends drew up a democratic constitution which bore a striking resemblance to those of the New England cities of the olden times, save that the latter were based on the laws of Moses and the former on the spirit of Christianity. The one was cold, rigid and repressive and the other genial and sympathetic. He favored the first Monte di Piet脿 to protect the people against the usurious Jews, and curiously enough on the same basis and with the same percentage as a similar institution recently founded in Boston by a number of wealthy charitable gentlemen. He also recalled to Florence the descendants of Dante, who had been under a ban for 250 years. A powerful league was formed to crush out the republic of Florence and to bring back the old licentious times, and evil days came. In planning to dethrone Pope Alexander VI, Savonarola was simply fighting for the church against a cruel usurper, but this raised against him two classes of enemies, and these, by combining, wrought his destruction. The Pope tried all means to get Savonarola in his clutches, but the latter was too wily. Every attempt was made to murder him, and he could not walk in the streets without an armed guard. Savonarola appealed to the whole Christian world to dethrone the usurping Pope, and it was at this juncture that Francesco de' Medici made his armed attempt to enter Florence. This was completely frustrated, and the heads of the conspiracy in the city put to death. Savonarola was forbidden to preach, excommunicated, and persecuted in every way. He prepared a letter to be sent to the Kings of France, Spain, Hungary and England, and to the German Emperor. Only that to Charles VIII was sent off, and it was intercepted by the tyrant of Milan and sent to Rome. The Pope's fury knew no bounds. He had either to crush Savonarola or be crushed himself. The affections of the people for Savonarola were cunningly alienated, and San Marco was attacked with knife and sword. The monks resisted, but were overpowered, and Savonarola and his friend Fra Domenico were captured and carried to the Signoria, Piazza Benedetto following and demanding to share their fate. Savonarola was thrice subjected to the most exquisite tortures, but nothing damaging could be drawn from him. Nevertheless, the Pope's deputies insisted on his execution, and in defiance of all justice he was condemned as a heretic, schismatic and criminal to be hanged and his body burned in company with his two faithful friends. This sentence was carried out on the 23rd of May, 1498. He perished at the age of 40, one of the noblest and purest men that modern Europe has produced, perished in the struggle for virtue and spirituality against vice and worldliness. With Savonarola perished the last hopes of an inward reform of the whole church. He was devoted heart and soul to the church, and was the last great reformer who was so. Thus it came to pass that the church, the great spiritual institution of the world, was rent in twain, and one part of it made a mere attachment to worldly thrones while the other hardened more and more into formalism. The Reformation was a necessity, but none the less it had many evil effects from which we are suffering today. It drew out of the church many of the men who were best fitted to guide it in the way of peaceful evolution. And it was left in the hands of its retrograde members. There are faults and shortcomings on both sides, and it is the task of our time to overcome this and to bring the spiritual once more into relation with the material so that our life may recover its meaning as a preparation for eternal beneficent existence in the world of realities. Then the spiritual philosophy which had its roots in Aristotle's intellect, and Jesus' life will become the guiding power of all.

Details, PAGE E11 Cabinet authorizes secret loan to hotelier PHILIP AUTHIER GAZETTE QUEBEC BUREAU QUEBEC The provincial cabinet has quietly authorized a $2.9-million loan to Quebec hotel magnate Raymond Malenfant to help his struggling empire through the recession. Malenfant, the man at the centre of the Manoir Richelieu labor conflict and the 1988 Quebec hotelier of the year, is to get the money from the government's industrial development agency, the Société de Développement Industriel, under a program to help businesses affected by the economic slowdown. While not confirming the amount, Dominique Lambert, press aide to Industry and Commerce Minister Gerald Tremblay, said last night the loan was authorized. Documents presented to cabinet by Tourism Minister André Vallée who piloted the request show Malenfant was to be granted a one-year loan of $2.9 million. It is conditional on his obtaining other financial backing, including a recent request for a $42-million loan from the Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec. The cabinet document said the announcement was to have been kept secret until April 1992 because publicizing it would compromise the financial picture of Malenfant's PLEASE SEE LOAN, PAGE A2 as Buildings ineyriniagidSii BOB DEANS COX NEWS SERVICE NEW DELHI More than 50,000 mourners had streamed past the shrouded body of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi by this morning, as his Italian-born widow was chosen to lead his party's drive to regain power in the world's largest democracy. While the mourners paid their last respects at Gandhi's coffin, millions more poured into the streets elsewhere across India in expressions of grief and anger over his death. The 46-year-old politician was killed in a bomb blast Tuesday night while campaigning in southern India. Tough security measures helped head off violent protests, but 11 people were killed nonetheless as a stunned and emotionally wracked nation began a week of official mourning and braced for a state funeral scheduled for tomorrow. The party's working committee selected 43-year-old Sonia Gandhi to head the 106-year-old Congress Party, which has dominated Indian politics for nearly five decades. But it was not immediately clear if she would accept. Her selection stunned some analysts. It appeared aimed at demonstrating party unity and assuring the party of attracting sympathy votes in parliamentary elections that were suspended yesterday due to the assassination. Polls showed Rajiv Gandhi to be the front-runner in the elections. The polling is to resume in mid-June. If Sonia Gandhi were to accept the party presidency and the party emerged with a majority following the delayed general election on June 12 and 15, she could be- PLEASE SEE GANDHI, PAGE A15 Sonia Gandhi: a profile PAGE A15 Democracy big loser PAGE B3 iM 35 IM?

Top-seeded Conchita Martinez of Spain overwhelmed Linda Ferrando of Italy 6-0, 6-2. Stefan Edberg and Magnus Gustafsson carried Sweden to a 3-0 victory over Spain, virtually assuring the Swedes of a berth in the finals of the World Team Cup tournament in Dusseldorf. Gustafsson defeated Juan Aguilera 6-3, 6-3 and Edberg beat Emilio Sanchez 6-4, 6-4 before they teamed to beat Sanchez and Sergio Casal 7-5, 6-1 in doubles.

Motorsports In an unprecedented move, the sanctioning body for stock car racing's top circuit reduced the 12-week suspension handed to car owner Junior Johnson for using an oversized engine. The decision was made by NASCAR commissioner Simon E. Knudsen less than three hours after officials announced that an appeals panel had refused to soften the suspension. Knudsen, the final possible route of appeal, trimmed the suspension to four races. Johnson and crew chief Tim Brewer, who also had been slapped with a 12-week suspension, will be eligible to rejoin their team at Michigan next month. Meanwhile, Mark Martin won the pole for the Coca-Cola 600 by being the fastest of three drivers to break the year-old event record at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Martin had a top lap of 174.820 miles an hour in his Ford Thunderbird. Ken Schrader and Michael Waltrip also broke the record of 173.693 mph set by Schrader last year. Soccer Billy McNeill's four-year reign as Celtics manager ended when he was sacked after an hour-long meeting of the Scottish League soccer team's directors. In another move, Southampton of English Division 1, sacked manager Chris Nicholl and first team coach Dennis Rofe. Manchester United plans to become the fourth English League team to go public. Current owner Martin Edwards said he hopes to raise $33 million by selling 75 per cent of the team in a public stock offering. Most of the money will be used to refurbish Old Trafford stadium.

THURSDAY MAY 23, 1991 NOISE! Modern life takes toll on hearing SHERYL UBELACKER CANADIAN PRESS TORONTO Hair dryers, vacuum cleaners, stereos, lawn mowers, motor boats, chain saws. Indoors and out, Canadians are assaulted by a daily cacophony of noise. Although often painfully aware of all the buzzing, screeching, clattering and wailing, most have no idea what those sounds are doing to their hearing. For a growing number of people, all that noise is causing them to lose it. Forever. A hearing loss is permanent and irreversible, said Denis Morrice, executive director of the Canadian Hearing Society. There's no medical solution, no operation. A hearing aid does not correct hearing, it just amplifies sound. Morrice said about 10 per cent of the population has some hearing loss, and most cases can be attributed to the seemingly unceasing pounding on the ears associated with modern living. Almost everything is starting to cause a problem because we have been conditioned to accept noise, he said in an interview. And we've been taught that louder is better; louder is more powerful. Your home may be your castle, but that doesn't mean it's quiet. Household appliances can bombard the ears: hair dryers and vacuum cleaners at least 70 decibels; electric razors 85 decibels; coffee grinders more than 90 decibels. Hearing damage begins to occur with sustained exposure to sounds measuring 85 decibels. Getting away from it all in the basement workroom offers no escape. Many electric tools such as a power saw at 110 decibels can be deafening. Garden and leisure equipment can be just as bad: lawn mowers 90 to 110 decibels; outboard boat motors and chain saws 100 decibels. The higher the decibel level, the shorter the length of time needed to harm the ears permanently, said Toronto audiologist Marshall Chasin. But it's the cumulative effect over time of noise-makers the coffee-grinder on top of the baby's toy drum on top of the hair dryer that gradually and insidiously steals our hearing, Chasin said. Among the most ruinous for the ears are portable cassette players and in-car stereos, or boom boxes, cranked up full volume, Chasin said. One of his patients, a 19-year-old girl, had her portable cassette blasting at 126 decibels and she has suffered severe hearing loss. Too much noise damages hairlike sensory cells in the inner ear, which transmit sound through the auditory nerve to the brain. The repeated hammering of high-intensity sound can cause those hair cells to break off or die. They are trampled, just like blades of grass, Morrice said. First to go is recognition of higher pitched sounds, but people often don't realize they can't hear them, he said. Even when hearing loss begins affecting perception of the lower speech range, many people believe their hearing is fine, but the other person is mumbling. I wish blood would drip from the ear when you're losing your hearing, Morrice said. We just won't do anything, because it's invisible. But hearing loss can be prevented, Morrice and Chasin said. Besides always wearing ear protection around noisy equipment, people should push for legislation regulating noise levels on manufactured goods and exercise their power as consumers by not buying the hair dryer that makes so much noise, Morrice said. We have to turn our attitude right around, the same way we did with smoking and hockey helmets and drinking and driving. Noise is something we can do something about. Being meticulous won't stop lice from making headway I'm considered to be a meticulous housekeeper in fact, some people might say too meticulous. So how do you account for the fact that my daughter was sent home from school with a note that she had lice in her hair? Could she have gotten them from our dog? Is there any way to avoid this in the future?

Default,339,"I was with 14 other golfers at 74; Karin Mundinger of Toronto was with one other golfer at 79; and Tara Fleming, also of Toronto, was in a group of three at 80. Jim Colbert and Rocky Thompson were in the clubhouse at 5-under-par 139 when a thunderstorm halted the second round of the Senior Players Championship in Dearborn, Mich. Thompson shot a 1-under 71 and Colbert matched par 72. An inch of rain fell in an hour on the TPC of Michigan golf course, and two hours later officials decided they couldn't get the bunkers into playable condition in time to complete the second round. Pete Jordan, of Tampa, Fla., fired a 5-under-par 67 to grab the lead at the midway point of the $150,000 Nike New England Classic in Falmouth, Me. Jordan, who shot a 70 Thursday, took a three-stroke lead over first-round leader Jon Christian, who posted scores of 67-73-140. Rick Todd of Toronto was the only Canadian to make the cut with a 75 for 145. Ashley Chinner (76-152), and Jack Kay Jr. (74-153), both of Toronto; Remi Bouchard of Brossard, Que. (79-154); and Glen JHnatiuk of Selkirk, Man. (85-168) missed the cut. Tadami Ueno of Japan shot a 3-under 69 to take a two-stroke lead over compatriots Tateo (Jet) Ozaki and Seiki Okuda after the second round of the Mizuno Open in Hakui, Japan. Ueno had an 8-under 136 total on the 6,838-yard Tokinodai Country Club course. Okuda shot a 68 and Ozaki had a 69. Brent Franklin of Vancouver had a second successive 72 and was at even-par 144. Rick Gibson of Whistler, B.C., navy Admiral Jonathan Howe, who directed the military operation against Aidid, flew by helicopter to Ali Mahdi's side of town this week to brief the ""interim president"" on the UN campaign. Russia steps in. REUTERS LONDON OBSERVER TALLINN - Estonia faces a grave crisis after its parliament passed a new ""law on foreigners"" this week declaring that all inhabitants who are not citizens are foreigners who must within a year apply for residence and work permits. The controversial law is aimed at resolving the precarious legal status of roughly 470,000 ethnic Russians and other Slavs who now make up about 30 per cent of the Estonian population. Many are former Soviet soldiers or their children who settled in the prosperous Baltic nation over the 50 years since the Soviet takeover. In essence, the law requires non-Estonians to learn the Estonian language and become citizens, or even face the possibility of being forced to leave the country. In reaction yesterday, Russia halted gas supplies to Estonia. The action came a day after Russian President Boris Yeltsin threatened unspecified ""measures"" against Estonia if the Baltic state goes ahead with the controversial law. The dispute has plunged Russian-Estonian relations to their lowest point since Estonia gained its independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991. Yeltsin said Estonia's leaders would be responsible for any disruption of peace in Estonia that might occur because of the law, referring to threatened labor actions by workers in predominantly Russian-populated areas of northeastern Estonia. Yeltsin said the new law amounts to apartheid. Temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. High: 25 Low: 14. High: 27 Low: 14. Today's level: 8.3. High: 11 Moderate. Light cloud cover.

""After so many people have died, the world now realizes that the only obstacle to peace is Aidid and his group,"" Ali Mahdi said with a smile of smug satisfaction. ""If the world realizes that Aidid is the only obstacle and has to be removed, that is good for all Somalis."" Many Somalis say Ali Mahdi is as culpable as Aidid in the country's disintegration following the collapse of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre's regime in January 1991. The power struggle between the rival warlords, sitting on opposite sides of the capital, turned into a senseless shelling war that left up to 30,000 people dead or maimed. If a war crimes tribunal were held and Ali Mahdi's name would figure alongside those of Aidid, Omar Jess, Mohamed Said Hersi Morgan and a handful of others accused of being responsible for the country's long suffering. But since the arrival of the first foreign troops in Somalia last December, Ali Mahdi has become the model warlord. While Aidid chose the path of resistance and obstruction, Ali Mahdi has cooperated with the foreign forces. He first put all his weapons into designated depots, and then turned those sites over to UN control. He signed every peace agreement put to him and has largely adhered to the Estonian form of apartheid. The Russian-speakers, who comprised about one third of the country's population, are without citizenship because they have been unable to pass the Estonian language test necessary for naturalization. Nevertheless, many of them were born in Estonia or have lived here many years, and they are upset by the government's attempt to declare them ""foreigners"" in the country they consider home. ""Don't they understand they are playing with fire?"" said Nikolai Vorobyov, chairman of the Slavonic Cultures Society in Estonia, in a telephone interview from Tallinn. Vorobyov has citizenship because he has lived in Estonia since 1938, before the Soviet occupation. High: 26 Low: near 13. Sunny with a few clouds, windy. Eastern Ontario High: 26 Low: near 13.

Herron told radio station WITL in Lansing he heard the boom and then calls started coming in from anxious residents. Some said it was a blue flash, some said it was sort of amber, he said. Some people said (the rumble) was more impressive than the sound thunder would make, and it shook the ground more than thunder would.

A 6 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, MONDAY, JULY 17, 1995 Storm 'tossed cars like they were golf balls' CORINNA SCHULER CANADIAN PRESS TORONTO - In a flash, a wicked twister ripped apart Darlene Van Allan's neighborhood. But, like many Ontario communities hit by weekend thunderstorms and tornadoes, the town of Bridgenorth is starting to piece itself together again. ""I've got sheet metal hanging from my trees like tin foil,"" said Van Allan, who was among nine families who found refuge in nearby Peterborough hotels after emergency officials deemed their homes unsafe. ""My neighbor's roof blew off and another house had its windows blown out. There's mud on their walls and sticks sticking out of the sofa."" At least three ""very rare"" nighttime tornadoes touched down early Saturday, tearing a 500-kilometre track north from Sault Ste. Marie to Algonquin Park and south from Kincardine on Lake Huron to Port Hope on central Lake Ontario. Ferocious thunderstorms, heavy rains, hail the size of golf balls and winds up to 140 kilometres per hour accompanied the twisters. Heavy rains continued yesterday in some areas. Two people died of heart attacks during the storm - one man when lightning struck near him and a woman after a tree fell on her house. The town of Goderich, about 70 km north of London, remained in a state of emergency as residents who had been without power since Thursday lined up to toss their food in city dumpsters. Residents go through rubble after a tornado sliced through Balsam Lake Trailer Park near Fenelon Falls, Ont., Saturday. Mayor Delbert Shewfelt estimated local damage at more than $1 million. Electricity is slowly being restored but at least 25 per cent of the town's 3,000 homes were expected to be without power today. And crews were working to chop and haul away more than 200 trees that toppled in the storm - some more than a century old. ""The cemetery is just devastated, trees are down and headstones are smashed in,"" said Shewfelt. ""It was the most beautiful cemetery in the world."" The storm hit hardest in a circle of communities east of Lake Simcoe, about 100 km north of Toronto, including Orillia, Lindsay, and Bridgenorth. Allan Crawford was smack in the middle of it all, inside his brother's trailer. ""It just rolled on its roof, everything just went flying. I had to crawl over the stove to get out."" Five other trailers were destroyed beyond repair, five vacationers were injured and one elderly couple has been left without a home. ""It tossed cars around like they were golf balls,"" said trailer park manager Grant James. The trailer park's residents were using candles yesterday as power outages continued and officials were hauling in fresh lake water for drinking. Top court likely to hear challenge of Canada's child-pornography law STEPHEN BINDMAN SOUTHAM NEWS OTTAWA - Canada's contentious 2-year-old kiddie-porn law is headed for a quick constitutional showdown in the country's top court. Toronto artist Eli Langer has asked the Supreme Court of Canada for permission to challenge the Criminal Code's new child-pornography provisions as a violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms' guarantee of freedom of expression. And the Ontario government - which unsuccessfully prosecuted Langer's art - has agreed the case raises issues of ""national importance"" and should be heard. That makes it likely the Supreme Court will agree to hear the challenge even though the law has never been tested in a court of appeal. ""The appeal would permit the court to consider the relationship between artistic expression and the core values protected by (freedom of expression),"" Langer's lawyers say in their written submissions. The 27-year-old artist was charged under the child pornography law after Toronto police raided the Mercer Union Gallery in December 1993 and seized five large oil paintings and 34 small pencil drawings. The explicit pictures showed children in a variety of sex acts and some include adults. The charges against Langer and the director of the gallery were later dropped and the crown instead proceeded with a rare forfeiture hearing to decide whether the artwork was pornographic and should be destroyed. In essence, the art itself was put on trial. Justice David McCombs of Ontario Court ruled in April that Langer's art was not illegal. Although he called the pictures ""shocking and disturbing,"" McCombs said they had ""artistic merit."" (Under Criminal Code provisions rushed into law by the former Conservative government before the 1993 election, a person must be acquitted if the judge is satisfied the works have artistic merit.) The judge also said he was not convinced the pictures ""pose a realistic risk of harm to children."" But McCombs rejected a vigorous constitutional challenge mounted by lawyers for Langer and groups representing artists, writers and civil libertarians. He said the child-pornography law was a reasonable restriction on artists' freedom of expression to protect children from the harmful impact of child pornography. ""In my view, Parliament has not only a right but a responsibility to do what it lawfully can to protect children from being used by child pornographers and from having photographic records of their abuse circulated."" Ontario prosecutors did not appeal the finding that the artwork was not child pornography, but Langer is seeking to challenge the judge's ruling that the law does not violate the charter. In submissions, lawyer Frank Addario says the law is vague, overbroad and ""imposes an unreasonable burden on artistic expression."" And he objects to the requirement the work have some sort of ""merit"" before the artist can be acquitted.

But now only one Japanese crested ibis remains alive, alone on an island preserve. The highly publicized near-extinction of the snowy-feathered, long-beaked ibis has focused attention on the country's scores of other endangered species - and has prompted some soul-searching about the destruction of nature that has accompanied Japan's economic growth. The ibis, with its graceful walk and its 2-metre wingspan, has been depicted for centuries in Japanese scroll paintings and on sliding screens. Older Japanese recall how the gentle birds would approach children playing in parks. ""No one imagined that the ibis could become extinct,"" says Ryuichi Yokoyama, a director of the Nature Conservation Society of Japan. ""But now that we've realized it, it's too late."" Japan's Environment Agency says 119 other species of birds are threatened in Japan, including 27 on the verge of extinction. In addition, 217 species of animals are threatened, it says. Extensive land development and pollution of rivers are largely to blame, nature conservationists say. The ibis needs marshes to survive, but chemicals and detergents have polluted much of Japan's marshland. Even migrating birds are finding it difficult to find unpopulated areas to spend the winter. Gan, or wild geese that migrate to Japan from Siberia, once wintered in large areas of Japan, but now 90 per cent of the 20,000 who come each year are forced to congregate in one marsh in Izunuma, 350 kilometres northeast of Tokyo. Conservationists warn that Japan must stop neglecting wildlife in its push ahead with economic development projects. ""We must pursue a way of living in symbiotic relationships with wildlife and prosper together,"" says Tsunao Watanabe, assistant director of the wildlife preservation division at the Environment Agency. Conservationists say they're pleased that some communities have begun taking action as a result of the plight of the crested ibis. The city of Morioka in northern Japan recently decided to buy 80 hectares of privately owned forest land where a pair of golden eagles have nested since 1974. ""We wanted to act before it was too late,"" said Takuo Osaki, a Morioka official. Only about 300 golden eagles are believed to exist in Japan. In another case, developers of a large resort complex near Lake Tazawa, about 450 kilometres north of Tokyo, withdrew their plan after a survey by conservationists found a golden eagle living in the area, Yokoyama said. The saga of the vanishing ibis took a melancholy turn last month when Feng-feng, a female Chinese crested ibis, was returned home to China's Shanxi province after an unsuccessful attempt to mate her with Long-long, Japan's last male crested ibis. Feng-feng laid five eggs in April but all were unfertilized. Two weeks later, Long-long died of illness or old age. Japan now has only one female crested ibis left, who is believed to be the equivalent of 85 to 110 human years of age and no longer fertile. About 50 crested ibises survive in China, all living in captivity or dependent upon conservationists. Environment agency says 120 species of birds and 217 species of animals are threatened. Swiss banks doubtful about Holocaust wealth REUTER; ZURICH - Swiss banks say the chances are slim of finding assets left by Jews murdered in the Holocaust. The banks reject speculation that they profited from billions of dollars allegedly left ownerless since World War II. But the banks, accused by some Jewish groups of making it hard for rightful heirs to find lost accounts, have pledged to speed up searches for a few so-called ""ownerless"" accounts they say might still exist. A Reuters poll of the three biggest Swiss banks - Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp, and Credit Suisse - found officials skeptical about finding many ownerless Holocaust accounts. The banks once before swept their vaults for ownerless accounts from Nazi victims, forced by a 1996 law that turned up about 9.5 million Swiss francs ($8.2 million U. C6 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, MONDAY, JULY 17, 1995 Jarrett proves good to the last drop Driver hangs on for NASCAR win EBB Dale Jarrett used every drop of fuel to get within a half-mile of victory, then coasted around the final turn and hung on to beat Jeff Gordon yesterday in NASCAR's Miller Genuine Draft 500 at Long Pond, Pa. ""This one is for the team, after everything they've been through,"" Jarrett said after winning for the first time this year and giving car owner Robert Yates his first victory since May 15, 1994. The team has been beset by tragedy the last two seasons. Two years ago this week, driver Davey Allison was killed in a helicopter crash at Talladega, Ala. Last August, Ernie Irvan nearly lost his life after crashing in practice at Brooklyn, Mich. He hasn't driven since. Jarrett needed a push to the winner's circle after his car stopped less than a mile beyond the line. He beat series leader Gordon by about five car lengths (0.19 seconds) to win for the first time in 17 rides for Yates. The victory was only the third this year for a Ford Thunderbird, and the fourth for the 38-year-old driver. Track and field World champion Colin Jackson outleaned Florian Schwarzhoff to win the 110-metre hurdles in 13.32 seconds at the European Athletic Association track-and-field meet, avenging a loss to the German four days earlier. Jackson, of Britain, was a stride ahead with 10 metres left, but Schwarzhoff closed strongly to clock 13.36 in a photo finish. Meanwhile, Samuel Matete of Zambia turned in the year's fourth-fastest 400-metre hurdles, leaving behind an outclassed field in 47.87 seconds. B IN LAPPEENRANTA, Finland, Sammy Langat of Kenya ran the world's fastest 800 metres of the year at an invitational meet. Langat, 23, was timed in a personal record of one minute, 43.84 seconds and led two other Kenyans under this year's best time, a 1:44.67 set by yet another Kenyan, Wilson Kipketer.

That remains to be seen. But one thing's certain: the addition of his right-handed bat means that another IF will be moved before tonight's game against the Cardinals, either in a trade or being sent down to Triple-A Ottawa.

the only Quebec event in which points count toward the national championship Late last month, Beauchamp had overheating problems with his brand-new Thunderbird in a major event at Quebec City where he was sixth-fastest qualifier but could not finish the race He figures he has the kinks worked out now Since that event, he's won the last two races at St Eustache and claims he's ready for an invasion of stock car drivers, which includes stars from Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia We have seven Quebec drivers taking part, Saint-Eustache director Jean Francois Decarie said, but the competition to get into the race is tough These are the best stock-car racers in the country It is the first time we have this calibre of field race here Action begins at 1 p.m. with time trials The field is then split into two groups, based on even and odd fastest finishers -1-3-5 etc., in one group and 24-6 etc., in the other The two groups then each have a 50-lap (four-tenths of a mile) race, with the fastest 13 from each race moving into the final 100-lap Castrol 200 The qualifying in this series is intense During a recent event at the half-mile Delaware track in London, Ont., the difference between the fastest 32 cars was 810ths of a second Beauchamp looms as favourite among Quebecers and possibly in the impressive field, because he has been fast lately For instance, last Sunday he was at the back for the start of the 50-lap weekly feature, but was in front after 29 laps After winning the Federation Automobile Quebec's ice-racing title in 1980-81, Beauchamp moved into dirt-track competition where he won rookie honors in the mid-80s Following lessons at the Spenard-David Racing school in Shannonville, Ont, Beauchamp tried asphalt racing in 1991 He won three events in each of the '92 and '93 seasons in the ACN series, even more impressively, earning 14 top-five finishes in 17 races during his second season Beauchamp began scoring points in the competitive ACT series in 1994 and last year had four top-10 finishes in just seven ACT starts i' mmm mmwm Qukldine ONLY 50 CENTS PER CALL i t mm ffliy mm contemporaries is perhaps to stretch reality Around this period, Soulages's art undergoes a major change, with the molecules of paint seemingly whipped into frothy motion In the especially beautiful painting of 29 June, 1956 (Soulages never uses titles but rather the dates of completion), the striatums and edges of the creamy black markings seem to crest, with the real light of the room bouncing off the pigment and back at the viewer as never before We might say that Soulages's art has three levels - the surface of the work, the space in front, and the virtual space within the canvas or paper For example, in the huge work of 15 December, 1962, the artist applies pigment so that it seems to soak into the canvas And increasingly, as in this beautiful painting, Soulages's art becomes more overtly distanced from personal feeling For those who insist that art tell the story of the soul, this work remains a mask The wide brush marks are too secure in their status as shape to refer to any moment in the artist's inner life Works from the early 1960s are somewhat declamatory, with thundering markings that are nevertheless well rehearsed In the late 1960s, the dark clouds expand to bursting The resonant brown deep within the monumental black mass in the painting of 20 October, 1967, appears ready to swell and to surge forward and over the viewer And in the monumental painting of 14 May, 1968, hefty, vertical dark shapes multiply into a whole row of outward pushing presences PIERRE SOULAGES, KINEMAGEMONTRE At 1996 Soulages work dated 29 September, 1967 In the long period between the late 1960s and 1980, Soulages's shapes alternately expand and deflate, sometimes to the point of anorexia, as in 3 June, 1971, with its tangled wreath of brush-work suspended, like a rope bridge, over an arid, almost clinical background Again, there is a kind of above-below effect; our sights move from deep pools of white to the textured, black ridges of the brushwork In the 1980s, most loopholes are closed, and black spreads across the canvases The formats also become increasingly horizontal, so that the shape of the works is aligned with the back-and-forth movement of the viewer As Soulages explains with gusto, We are in the space of the painting In transitional paintings like 27 February, 1979, a somewhat weak - though appealing - work, the image remains somewhat two-tone, with a subtle element of drama resulting from contrasts of textures that take away from the deeper import In short, the subtlety here is quite self-conscious and keeps the work from going further in meaning But such slips into elegance-for-its-own-sake are rare and are more than compensated by works, such as 7 February, 1985, a vast, black sweep of left-to-right striations In this powerful piece, the flow is checked by a series of thin, vertical lines But, in the end, this rudimentary grid in fact serves to accentuate the sense that the edges of the work are but arbitrary markers and that somehow the painting will break through its natural boundaries As we move around in front of the painting, the surface becomes activated by the shifting light on the tiny ridges of paint, that in this work, the brush strokes are stacked, not composed in counterpoint, only adds to the fascinating - if unsettling - sense of motion and instability radiating around us But, if we were hoping, through getting close, to better know the work - or artist - we may be sorely disappointed, for the force-field projected by the painting is constantly changing as we move along it Each seemingly secure element in the painting seems to intentionally self-destruct, so that, for example, the materiality of the thick pigment, with its ridges, is visually dissolved by the reflected light Soulages explains that Each person can get what they want out of the pictures In the minds and hands of lesser artists, this everything-is-beautiful concept becomes an excuse for bad art But, in the case of Soulages, the art holds its own, in part because he doesn't really abide by the saying but instead produces art that dramatizes it Soulages's art is not wishy-washy, but what it does do is - at its deepest level - articulate certain views on the current status of personal identity The built-in paradox is that, while affirming a supremely powerful identity on the part of the artist himself, Soulages's work represents a lifelong assault - in tandem with artists like Jean Dubuffet - on the very concept of personal identity Are we not in truth just elements in an endless hall of mirrors? Soulages, himself a jaunty man sporting a gray-on-gray outfit, ultimately does express something - a peculiarly Parisian pessimism about the nature of the self And in the last two decades, this darkness has shown through ever more brightly in paintings that have grown to vast proportions The bigger the work, the more we move around and stir up the light reflected off the surface In the process, it becomes difficult to grasp the art as a single object Perhaps in this age of I-love-me, when a popular magazine is titled simply Self, the fatal beauty of Soulages's work can be seen as a healthy antidote That the works are extremely uplifting, not depressing, is part of their greatness Pierre Soulages: The Black, the Light, will remain on view at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts to

The south end of the lake is a slit surrounded by sheer cliffs that go straight down into bottomless clear turquoise water The brave, the hot and the foolhardy cliff jump into the icy water, which is also popular with scuba divers Less energetic visitors can admire the peaceful setting as they wander along the top of the rocks five metres above the water 1 Athabasca Falls (31 km) These are one of the major parkway attractions The Athabasca River drops 25 metres into a deep gorge and the site is crisscrossed with paved paths and viewpoints One path goes down a narrow channel carved by the water eons ago, leading to a lookout over the river Mount Fryatt Viewpoint (38 km) This is one of the few reliable places to see the elusive mountain goats Goats eat the pale dirt here, which is eroded into hoodoo towers, because it apparently contains minerals they need If they aren't standing on the hill on the east side of the highway, stop at the viewpoint and see if they're down the dirt bank Even if the goats aren't around, you'll get a glorious view of the Athabasca River valley Buck and Osprey Lakes (53 km) These two quiet picnic spots are a short walk from the highway Osprey Lake, which has picnic tables and an outhouse, is 1.2 km from the parking lot Buck Lake is just a few hundred metres They're surrounded by trees that smother most of the traffic noise, allowing you to contemplate the surrounding mountains in relative peace EE 2 Mosquito Creek, Rampart Creek, Hilda Creek or other Banff park hostels, phone (403) 762-4122 There are also numerous campgrounds, but they don't take

falls still offer thundering cataracts well worth the 500-metre drive off the parkway You can look straight down at the deep channel being cut in the limestone by the three chutes of the upper falls, which is as far as most people go But a gently sloping trail takes you two km further to the lower falls, a series of drops that carry on for hundreds of metres Be careful - a bench at the lower falls is dedicated to a Regina teenager who drowned in the river three years ago Bubbling springs, Endless Chain (60 km) The bubbling springs here make a wonderful contrast to the noise of the falls Cold water that has percolated down the slopes of the Endless Chain mountain ridge bubbles up in dozens of small jets from the bottom of a serene, crystal-clear pool beside a picnic pulloff The water carries greyish-green silt that coats the bottom of the 10-metre wide pool, forming a constantly changing pattern Stanley Falls (80 km) Getting to these requires a little more walking, but offers rewards for most of the half-hour trip Park at an unnamed hiking trail sign two km south of the Beauty Creek hostel, in the middle of the Sunwapta River floodplain The trail goes along a gravel berm, through some trees and turns right on to the old road allowance Walk about 500 metres, then turn left up a short, steep hill just before Beauty Creek (someone has built arrows out of rocks to indicate the turns) The trail goes along the top of a canyon, with numerous falls and round pools with rock walls worn smooth by the water Now you can understand why it's called Beauty Creek Wilcox Pass (99

rams Sri Lankan naval ship ASSOCIATED PRESS COLOMBO, Sri Lanka - A rebel suicide squad blew up a naval gunboat yesterday and pinned down a squad of elite commandos, killing its commander in one of the fiercest battles of the 13-year war for independence Tamil Tiger rebels rammed a speedboat packed with explosives into the gunboat, setting it on fire, said military officials who cannot be identified More than 40 sailors were aboard Their fate was unknown It also was not known how many rebels were in the speedboat, which exploded as the gunboat fired at rebel positions, the officials said The 36-metre gunboat Ranaviru was off Mullaittivu, site of a land battle for a military base vital to controlling the northeast coast of the Indian Ocean republic The fighting, in its second day, was the most intense since rebels lost their stronghold, Jaffna City, to the Sri Lankan army in December Lt-Col Fazly Lafir of the Special Forces Commando Unit reportedly bled to death after being shot Brigadier Lawrence Fernando, commander of Mullaittivu camp, was among the wounded A collection of political cartoons by Aislin, with text by Hubie Bauch Available at The Gazette Lobby, 245 St Jacques

Loyola High School has been in a number of locations during its long history Its antecedents go back beyond 1896 (the year when ""Loyola High School"" first became its name) In the 1840s, space was made for a school for English-speaking Catholic boys in the College Ste Marie, a French Jesuit school Rules were laid down Good behavior was required, especially in chapel Slouching, stretching, yawning were out Those early chapel services were a far cry from one described by Capt Maguire in 1916 He had just brought his cut-throats back from mass The chapel was a barn in France that had been converted into a theatre On the stage, a padre said mass In the orchestra pit, another padre, attired in boots and spurs and a Sam Brown belt, with a blue stole and a gas helmet slung round his neck, heard confessions Loyola High School's 100th-anniversary celebrations began with mass in St Patrick's Basilica earlier this year They end in October with a gala evening in The Windsor It is impossible to give an adequate idea of the storms in this country The first Anglican Bishop of Quebec, the Rt Rev Jacob Mountain, was describing a Canadian thunderstorm It was in July 1794 At that time, Montreal was part of the Quebec diocese On July 11, the bishop set out from Quebec to make his first visit to this city A week later, he and his party were within 35 miles of Montreal when a violent storm of thunder forced them to take shelter in a farmhouse The bishop drew a chair up to a window and gazed out Immense volumes of black clouds filled the sky Forked lightning zig-zagged across the clouds, throwing out bright purple flashes At one point, three or four of these zig-zagging lines joined together in a huge shaft of light that rushed furiously to the ground It was like nothing the bishop had ever seen at home in England He found it dreadfully, beautifully grand But what was beautifully grand could also be lethal When the storm cleared, the travellers got back into their carriages and proceeded on their way to Montreal They had not gone far when they came to a village where the people were in confusion and dismay Eight people in the village had been seated round a dining table Lightning had streaked in Two of those at the table were killed instantly On many occasions these magnificently awesome storms caused sudden death In 1830, the New Montreal Gazette (a short-lived rival to The Gazette) reported an instance of this kind Again, it was in July At a village just west of Montreal, visitors had come to call at a doctor's house They were sitting in the parlor with the doctor's wife when a great flash of lightning sped round the room When the doctor came home a few minutes later, he found everyone on the floor in a state of insensibility One man was dead In the words of that 1830 newspaper, the fatal fluid had removed him to a world of Spirits A child's birthday party ended in tragedy early in the present century It was being held at a farmhouse near the town of Cookshire, in the Eastern Townships It was about this time of year The birthday cake had been placed on the table The children were waiting for it to be cut Suddenly, fierce lightning darted into the room The young son of Ayton Cromwell, a Cookshire contractor, was nearest the window The lightning killed him His mother was to remember that we did not know anything was wrong until we realized he was not crying out in alarm like the other children Loyola High School is shown as it existed in N S8500 No GST 659-0488 4D'4V FORD Tempo '91, 2-dr, air auto, gold, 147,000 km, $3250

farm's miniature vegetables are even smaller than usual this year because of the rainy, cloudy weather Southern Quebec farmers fed up with wet summer MONIQUE BEAUDIN THE GAZETTE Diane Pinsonneault glanced at the tiny carrots and peas in her Atwater Market stall in west-end Montreal They're supposed to be small, but they're much, much, much smaller than normal, she said yesterday It just hasn't been hot enough for long enough this year Pinsonneault, who grows miniature vegetables on her 40-acre farm in Saint-Michel-de-Napierville, said this summer's weather has been tough on farmers There's been too much rain and just not enough sun I'm hoping for a late autumn and frost, but even then, I won't have a great season, she said, wrapping up a small box of beans Farmers around the Montreal area have been dealing with weird weather this year After a late spring, they've had tornados in the Eastern Townships, floods near Huntingdon, and a lot of rainy days around Montreal Farmers say the growing season is at least two weeks behind normal and many crops are stunted because they haven't been getting enough sun It's not just farmers who are having a hard time with Mother Nature La Ronde is giving out free tickets for the first time to try to drum up business after a dismal beginning to the season For the rest of the summer, the Ile Ste Helene amusement park will give a second free ticket to people who show up on days when the MeteoMedia weather network forecasts a 50-percent or higher chance of rain The free tickets can be used on another day We decided to put the bad weather on our side, La Ronde spokesman Christine Mitton said Attendance is down 25 per cent from last year's record-breaking 1.2 million visitors, she said This summer's weather has definitely been strange, Environment Canada meteorologist Bill Horrocks said But part of the problem is that we're comparing it with last summer, which was a record-breaker for heat and sunshine Back then, most farmers were complaining about a drought The big difference this year is that we're getting a lot of unstable air that is leading to frequent showers or thunderstorms, Horrocks said Normally, southern Quebec gets high-pressure systems that bring sunnier, more stable weather This year, the high-pressure system is farther east, he explained This is just an anomaly that takes place from time to time, Horrocks said Concordia University climatologist David Frost said it's as if our weather has gone to England for the summer My wife was in England for a month Growing season is at least 2 weeks behind normal Almanac doesn't predict much relief from rain, cloudiness JONATHON GATEHOUSE THE GAZETTE An Ontario family is suing a Quebec furniture manufacturer and a national retail chain for negligence after a chest of drawers fell on a 2-year-old girl, killing her Seven family members, including two siblings and three grandparents, seek a total of $200,000 for the loss of Brittany Ward's care, guidance and companionship under the Ontario Family Law Act The companies have 40 days to file a statement of defence The allegations must be proved in court In a statement of claim filed in a Toronto court Wednesday, the girl's family contends the manufacturer, Les Industries de la Rive Sud Ltee of Saint-Croix, and the retailer, Leon's Furniture Ltd of Weston, Ont, sold a poorly designed and hazardous dresser for children Brittany was killed Jan 14 when the four-drawer dresser in her bedroom tipped over, pinning her underneath An autopsy determined that she suffocated beneath the weight of the 40-kilogram piece of furniture The exact cause of the accident is unknown, but officials speculated the girl was trying to climb up on the dresser After an investigation, a Toronto coroner urged parents to check the stability of their children's furniture Many safety experts recommend that heavy pieces of furniture be bracketed to walls to lessen the danger of similar accidents The civil suit contends the chest of drawers was susceptible to tipping and would easily flip when pulled forward It also contends the manufacturer and retailer knew or ought to have known of the danger posed by the dresser Ex-FQ minister gets Brussels post Company officials at Les Industries de la Rive Sud Ltee could not be reached for comment yesterday In a telephone interview from his Mississauga, Ont, office, Brittany's father, Harry Ward, said he decided to take legal action to warn other parents of the potential danger; and make sure his daughter didn't die in vain The idea is to get as much publicity out there as possible so we can prevent this from happening again, he said Ward said he and his wife, a former daycare worker, had gone to great lengths to childproof their home, putting latches on doors and buying only approved toys You try to think of everything, but you would never think of the chest of drawers, he said The family wants the federal government to enact safety standards for the weight and design of children's dressers! The only regulation now in place is a ban on the use of paints containing lead Francois Houle, a spokesman for Quebec's provincial coroner, said his office has no knowledge of any similar fatalities in the province He called the case exceptional and said the coroner has no plans to issue a warning to parents We always ask parents to watch their children closely, but there are limits to what you can do, Houle said If a kid climbs up on a piece of furniture, it doesn't matter what it is, it could fall over A Health Canada database that tracks children treated in 15 hospital emergency rooms across the country found injuries caused by falling dressers were extremely rare Such accidents accounted for less than 0.1 per cent of the injuries reported each year, and only three patients had required hospitalization in five years, GAZETTE QUEBEC BUREAU QUEBEC - Denis de Belleval, a former Parti Quebecois cabinet minister, has been named Quebec's delegate-general to Brussels He replaces Gerard Latulippe and starts Sept 2 From 1976 to 1981, de Belleval served as transport minister and minister in charge of the civil service In 1982, he left to work for Lavalin International Inc In 1985, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appointed him chief of Canada Ports Corp In 1987, Mulroney named him to head Via Rail From 1990 to 1995, de Belleval worked for the city of Quebec itl V ith the purchase of one a la carte meal you and your guest are invited",1,19960720,modern,thunder,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Are Aidan Quinn, Courtney Cox and executive producer Ivan Reitman suddenly chopped liver in Hollywood? Why is it being under-released here, without benefit of promotion, publicity, a radio-sponsored premiere or an avalanche of rave advance reviews? Is it because America isn't considered ready to tackle issues like life, death, tragedy, injustice and vengeance? Is the relationship between man and God so personal - or old-fashioned - that we can't ask our maker, as Quinn's Seth does early on, Why are all these things happening to me? What did I do that was so wrong in your eyes to deserve such pain and suffering? Are these not valid points to be raised on the eve of the millennium and, for all we know, an apocalypse of biblical dimensions? Seth has good reason to wonder what happened to fair play As this weird but wonderful morality piece opens, Seth is confronting the inexplicable drowning death of his loving, pregnant wife As if this weren't enough burden to bear, his house is destroyed by a tornado Snapping under the pressure, he straddles the top of a neighbour's roof in a thunderstorm and demands of his God: I want an answer God responds with lightning Seth is scorched His dog Sparky is almost torched There is one further indignity: he's fired from his job Wifeless, homeless and jobless, Seth holes up in the Manhattan loft of his wife's lonely sister Rachel (Cox) and her amoral, muckraking journalist husband (LaPaglia), and plots revenge He decides to break all 10 Commandments If God has it in for him, he will stick it to God From this lofty premise, Taplitz and his standout cast craft a wicked, wistful comedy of wrath, frustration, love and misadventure to do Albert Brooks proud Funny, cutting, off-centre and genuinely preoccupied with big issues, Commandments deserved a much wider release Do they really think we're all dumb, scared and oblivious?

Just imagine, PARTY TIME? LEAVE IT TO PROS For more and more parents, the rec-room birthday party is a thing of the past as they turn the organizational hassle over to private firms that throw kiddie bashes for a living,

stretch, It's a cute, clean, crisp little cafe where patrons sit around reading for hours while sipping on teas from strange-looking teapots, nibbling on exotic little tidbits or filling up on substantial main dishes, I doubt if many of them grew up on koukou, pirojki, khoresh or alo-balo-polo, but they all seem to enjoy these dishes nevertheless and there isn't a bored face to be seen, Nor is it costing the diners a bundle, with snack-type items costing between $2.50 and $3.50 and main dishes a Anticipation Word has it we've crossed the vernal equinox, The longest, coldest, most irritating winter I can remember may finally be coming to an end, (I will be punished for saying this, I know, A snowstorm will drop three feet of snow on my driveway and my driveway alone as an April Fool's joke, ) Still, I can't help being optimistic, For wine fans, spring is one of the nicest times of the year, For one thing, we've got a whole new vintage to look forward to, As the heavy storms that lashed the North Atlantic this winter abate, ships are setting out from France, Italy and Spain loaded to the gunwales with the wines the Society des Alcools du Quebec ordered over the winter, They'll be landing in early April and the first wines of France's highly touted 1989 vintage will be in a store near you sometime in May, Sap is running Meanwhile, vintage 1990 is beginning to take shape, The vineyards of Europe and North America are coming alive, The sap is running in the vines and the first buds will be appearing shortly, In fact they may already be out in the hotter regions along the coast of the Mediterranean, Frost, hail, drought, flood, rot, disease and attacks of parasites may lie ahead, but for the moment, the vintage holds nothing but promise, In the southern hemisphere, the new vintage is coming off the vines even as we chip the last of the ice off the walk, In Chile and Argentina, the pickers are in the vineyards and row upon row of stainless steel fermenting vats are being scrubbed within an inch of their lives, Gato Negro and Casillero del Diablo will soon be going through the vats, into bottles and on their way to us, Down Under, the first vin nouveau of the '90s is probably already fermenting, It'll be into bottles and on its way to market within a month, Meanwhile, the quality grapes of Barossa, Coonawarra, McLaren Vale and Margaret River are in the last stages of ripening and the first stages of picking, Spring is a good time to be planning a cellar, If you don't have one, you can dream of building one, A cool, quiet corner in the basement is a good beginning, Racks can be as inexpensive as pine planks stacked on bricks, or as pricey as custom-built bins and a refrigeration unit for climate control, If you don't have a basement, a Tl ur Last week's lucky winner of our ""Be Our Guest"" Restaurant Contest was MS, MARY CHADSEY of Montreal with a $75 gift certificate for RESTAURANT ALDO, 298 Place d'Youville,

tables and chairs, intricate embroideries and weavings decorating the white walls, and its casual, laid-back ambience, features Persian cuisine and is owned by the charming Iranian-born Hemela Pourafzal who presides over her dining room as though it were her own home, The cooking, too, is very much home-style, not the elegant, sophisticated Persian cuisine one sometimes encounters in the all-too-rare restaurants of this kind, but the kind of dishes one might be served in an average Iranian home, We were at a bit of a loss to choose among the many small appetizer dishes until madame suggested we try a mazza (traditional mixed hors d'oeuvres) of cold dishes and another of hot, The first ($3,20) consisted of a platter containing portions of various yogurt dishes, There was refreshing yogurt with spinach and a touch of garlic, yogurt with chopped beets and mint, yogurt with eggplant, minced meat, nuts and mint, and finally, yogurt of new vintage is one joy of spring, J WAYNE OHIOSBV WINE cupboard will do, If you can't keep the temperature down, do what you can to keep it constant, It's the temperature swings that do the damage, You lived through a couple of 30-degree freeze-thaw swings this winter, You know how it made you feel, If you already have a cellar, now's the time to start thinking about restocking, New vintages and new wines will start flooding into the stores in a month or so, Time to get out the books and magazines and plan your attack, Since the big Bordeaux and Burgundies of 1989 will be aging for at least another year or two before coming onto the market, think about loading up on wines from the Loire, From muscadets right through to sancerres and chinons, the '89s promise to be things of splendor, Alsace should be another 9 ts

Default,345,"C and Katherina Kubenk of Kitchener, Ont, placed 13th and 16th, respectively, in the preliminaries and failed to qualify for the five-woman final. Lucie Barma of Lac Beauport and Nancy Wankling of Winnipeg, Canada's top medal contenders in ballet, were both sidelined with injuries. Five-time World Cup ballet champion Jan Bucher of the United States, the co-favorite with Kissling, fell halfway through her performance in the final. Bucher, who led after the preliminaries, slipped after landing a jump. She strained knee ligaments and was taken from the course on a stretcher. ""It hurt me to see Jan fall like that. We're competitors, but we're good friends,"" said Kissling, who was second to Bucher after the preliminary round in the morning. ""It happened so quickly. I've never seen her hurt like that before,"" Kissling, a 28-year-old from Messen, a tiny Swiss village near Berne, speculated that Bucher's fall was the result of icy conditions caused by Thursday's heavy rain and yesterday's cold temperatures. Kissling skis in all three freestyle disciplines (moguls and aerials are the other two), but said this will be her final season in the combined. ""I'm getting a bit old to do all three,"" she said. ""After this season I will concentrate on just the ballet."" Kissling voiced displeasure over the decision by the International Olympic Committee to grant official medal status only to the moguls event for the 1992 Olympic Games in Albertville, France. ""Freestyle is three events and all three should have been accepted,"" said Kissling. She conceded that ballet, similar to figure skating, was the most difficult event for people to understand. ""It's a legitimate sport, but because it's not one where the fastest time wins, people have a problem with it. When time is the only important thing, you have problems with doping of athletes. Ballet demands athletic ability and creativity."" The final four will be down to the final four after this weekend's action. Unfortunately for the National Football League, two of the best four teams won't be there. That's because the four National Football Conference teams involved in this weekend's NFC semifinals—Vikings, Giants, Rams, and 49ers—are better than the four American Football Conference participants—Broncos, Steelers, Bills, and Browns. Either of the NFC games—Vikings at 49ers today (4 p.m., CBS) or Rams at Giants tomorrow (12:30, CBS)—will feature better talent than the AFC games, which see the Bills playing at Cleveland today (12:30, NBC) and the Steelers at Denver tomorrow (4 p.m.). in confidence to: Gary Nichol NICHOL FINANCIAL SERVICES 3441 Stanley St, Montreal, Que, H3A 1R1 Professional Help Wanted 405 PLANT ENGINEER To manage multi-discipline project, 5-15 years experience.

Despite last winter's horror stories about the scarcity of snow on the slopes, for example, more than 200,000 North Americans packed up their boards and headed to Europe for a ski holiday. And it wasn't because they were stupid. They knew the horror stories were only partly true and that no matter what you read in the newspapers, it's nearly always possible to find snow somewhere in the Alps if you plan carefully. It's true that some traditional ski areas have weathered the last few winters looking more like golf courses. And flying all the way to Europe only to end up in a resort that has no snow can put you off the Alps for life. But such disasters can be avoided. There's plenty of good skiing in Europe if you pick your centres carefully. At the top of your list put Val d'Isere, Chamonix, La Plagne, and Les Trois Vallees in France; St Anton, Kitzbuhel, Innsbruck, and Saalbach in Austria; and Verbier, Zermatt, and St Moritz in Switzerland. They've all had ample snow in the last two years and most of them are either on or close to glaciers. But don't base your destination on the lowest price or the fame of the skiing centre. Instead, know the type of holiday you want— all-out skiing and nothing else or a more laid-back vacation. And be absolutely honest about your skiing ability. Some of the lowest priced trips are not really suited for people who aren't at least intermediate level skiers and a few are suitable only for advanced intermediate or even experts. Chamonix is a good example. There are a few trails for skiers with average ability but most of the really good skiing is for people who want 12 days of hard skiing down challenging runs or through off-piste powder. The Val d'Isere-Tignes complex and Val Thorens are for the same kind of people and so are St Anton, Kitzbuhel, and Badgastein in Austria, and Verbier, Zermatt, and Saas Fee in Switzerland. Skiers who want a nice mix of pleasant skiing with good food and some disco outings and shopping trips to round it off will be happier in older centres like Val d'Isere, Les Arcs, La Plagne, Alpes d'Huez, Les Deux Alpes, and the Les Trois Vallees complex in France; St Moritz and Klosters in Switzerland; or Solden, Salzburg, and Innsbruck in Austria. For instance, Les Trois Vallees (encompassing the centres of Val Thorens, Les Menuires, Meribel, and Courchevel) is one of the largest ski areas in the world with more than 500 km of groomed trails and over 200 lifts to serve them. Everyone, beginners and experts alike, can find something to test their skills as well as some chic nightlife in Courchevel, an old and charming village at the bottom of the hills, and Courchevel 1850 (that's its altitude, not its vintage) at the top. Ski magazines aren't the best guides for beginners or even intermediates. Their articles are often written by excellent skiers whose standards have little to do with the abilities of mere mortals. When you go is almost as important as where you go. Resorts are generally less crowded in January, late March, and April but they fill up at Easter and during the European school holidays in the latter half of February. To guide you in selecting the right destination and time, find a travel agent or tour operator who knows what he's talking about. He should know which centres have good snow and the dates of school holidays in the different countries, and if he doesn't, find someone else. Your agent should also have detailed, four-color resort maps you can look at or even take away. These maps mark all the lifts and have standardized color codes for the trails: green for very easy, blue for easy (intermediate), red for difficult (advanced intermediate), and black for very difficult (experts). If you learned to keep your skis parallel just last month, avoid resorts with a lot of black in them. Most maps make it easy for you by summarizing the number of trails in each category. For instance, of the 75 runs at my favorite resort, Les Deux Alpes, 19 are very easy, 30 are easy, 16 are difficult, and 10 are very difficult. If you have a low frustration level, you might prefer one of the newer resorts that make getting from your hotel room to the slopes quick and easy. Places like Les Menuires, Les Deux Alpes, Tignes, and La Plagne in France come to mind. They may lack the charm of older centres but they were designed solely for skiing. The terrain and runs were selected first. The lifts were positioned and then accommodations were built around them. Again, the importance of knowing the type of vacation you want will help decide between the convenience of a modern, concrete-dominated resort or one with atmosphere and style. Snow and altitude invariably go hand-in-hand. Resorts at higher altitudes generally have more reliable snow conditions, although heavy storms up there can also make for unskiable days. Look for centres that are between 2,000 and 3,000 metres above sea level. Most tour operators offering group outings have selected centres where the snow is reliable, the accommodation has been checked out for North American standards, and their prices generally can't be beaten. The sheer exhilaration of skiing off-piste or in the powder bowls is unparalleled but don't try it without a guide. Too many skiers have died after they ventured into territory that was beyond them. If you do get into trouble, there's no free service for injured skiers so you need insurance to cover the cost of getting to hospital. In France, Carte Neige coverage costs only about $25 a week and can be purchased from either the local national ski federation office or local tourist office. Skiers going to Switzerland and Austria should have out-of-country insurance, whether Blue Cross or Lloyds of London, to cover unexpected medical bills. Also check to see if your tour operator's insurance covers emergency flights home. One last tip: living at 1,800 metres or more above sea level and skiing at 3,000 metres can take its toll no matter how fit you are, so take it easy for the first few days. Swiss Alps offer picturesque villages and deep snow, if you know where to look. Package Total FRANCE Val d'Isere Club Med $1,233 Jet Tours $1,083 KLM $1,389 Sportsmania $1,159 Chamonix Club Med $1,066 Jet Tours $1,126 KLM $1,545 Sportsmania $989 Swissair $758 AUSTRIA St. Anton Adanac $1,229 CAI $1,230 DER $1,289 Sportsmania $1,365 Swissair $758 Kitzbuhel Adanac $939 CAI $1,161 DER $1,132 KLM $1,535 Proto Tours $999 Sportsmania $1,419 SWITZERLAND Verbier KLM $1,555 Sportsmania $1,359 Swissair $758 Airfare, Bus/Train transfer, Lodging, Ski pass, Ski lessons, Meals, Ski Insurance Included in price. Prices do not include taxes. SKIERS WHO want to go to Europe this winter have a lot of choices. Nearly all the major centres are covered by tour operators, along with some of the less well-known, at truly reasonable prices. For instance, Val d'Isere, Europe's most famous ski centre and one that's really popular with Canadians, is available for less than $1,100 for one week from Jet Tours. And that includes most meals, accident insurance, and ski tickets. Similarly, Kitzbuhel, one of Austria's best-known ski resorts, is also available for less than $1,100 from Adanac Tours. As with everything in the world today, there's no free lunch. You pay for what you get and there are lots of variables that affect the eventual cost so it's important to know what's included in the package you're buying. Ski passes, for example? If they're not included, find out how much extra it will cost. Are meals included? Which ones? If not, is there a kitchen with your accommodation? And is there quick access to grocery shopping? Are guides or lessons included? Air France's subsidiary, Jet Tours, generally comes out ahead of all others in their prices for French resorts simply because ski passes and ski insurance (Carte Neige) are included in their packages. Other operators do not cover these costs, thus pushing up their overall costs. Sportsmania, the most competitive, comes in at $989 for its seven-day package to Chamonix, but the additional $140 for a ski pass and about $25 for the essential Carte Neige insurance brings the total cost in at $1,154 compared to $1,126 from Jet Tours. However, Sportsmania includes two meals a day in its package and that could make it a better deal, depending on how much you spend on food. Club Med comes in at the top end of the price range in the centres where they operate. However, their packages are apparently all-inclusive. Three meals a day, along with wine at lunch and dinner, a ski pass, and ski lessons are included in Club Med's price. To help skiers get an inkling of who is offering what, the attached comparative table is based on the cheapest package for each destination. St. Anton and Kitzbuhel, in the Austrian Tyrol, and Chamonix in the Savoie region of France emerge as the three most popular destinations among the tour operators. An additional week can normally be added to packages at a reasonable cost, ranging from about $300 and up, depending on what is included. The level and quality of accommodation are the primary guidelines in establishing price. Bed and breakfast living is markedly different in price from a four-star hotel. There are a broad number of packages offered by operators. Prices vary on what is included in the length of the trip and what is included. While the table reflects prices for short trips, there are many longer trips offered. The longer trips are a better on a cost per day basis. Some are for 10-day periods. Others are for two weeks, and yet others are for two weeks, taking in two different ski centres. Some have guides accompanying a group. Everyone, it seems, has an opinion about Disney World. I fly to Florida at 4 o'clock this afternoon with my 11-year-old daughter Sarah, which means I've been rushing around all week and haven't had much time to write this column. And I still have a lot to do before I can abandon my desk and my wife for a week to go exploring the marvels of Walt Disney World. But I think Sarah has been ready since last Tuesday. Her bags are packed with her lucky unicorn tucked under her pyjamas and a swimming suit wrapped in a towel just in case we get to a beach. And she has read all that teensy type on the back of the ticket to make sure there's no way Canadian Airlines can squirm out of its commitment to fly her (and her dad) south to Orlando. It's really astonishing just how many people have preceded us on this pilgrimage to the Land of the Giant Mouse. Ever since I first started writing about this trip in my column two weeks ago, people I barely know have stopped me on the street, in the supermarket, and on the bus to recount their own Disney experiences. Typesetters in The Gazette's composing room, reporters in the business department, and even my parish priest have been giving me tips on what's worth seeing and what's not. Most of this has been pretty positive stuff but one man phoned to tell me he thought Disney World was a ripoff. He TRAVELLING LIGHT Paul Waters went in October and found it cold, crowded, and overpriced. ""The food!"" he said. ""And the souvenirs! You want a Coke, it costs $2. Minimum."" But Sarah and I? We're not discouraged. For one thing, the weather down there seems to be getting a little warmer after that nasty cold snap before Christmas, and for another, we have your letters and they seem pretty reassuring. It's still not too late to send your tips and suggestions to me at The Gazette, 250 St. Antoine St. W, Montreal, H2Y 3R7. I'll run the best ones in my column Jan. 20, the Saturday after we get back. Here's a little tidbit you can use the next time your flight home from Denmark is delayed. Frequent Flyer magazine rates the food at Copenhagen Airport as the best airport food in the world. The oysters and champagne get a big cheer from the American magazine but it's the oven-fresh delicacies at the bakery that really set the airport apart. I got a phone call last week from Gabor Nagy, a chartered accountant who was born in Hungary but who has been living in Canada for years. He wasn't terribly happy with the story we published on Budapest two weeks ago. ""Do you realize,"" he asked, ""that Budapest has two opera houses and that for $1.50 you can see productions that are every bit as good as those in Vienna?"" There are 20 theatres as well, he said, and while serious drama may be beyond anyone who doesn't understand Hungarian, there are usually three or four big musicals on at any given time. ""They're mostly Western,"" Mr. Nagy said. ""Cats, Phantom of the Opera, and for musicals it doesn't matter so much if you don't understand the language."" Mr. Nagy also said our story ignored the best pastry shop in all Budapest—the Cafe Vienna in the Forum Hotel where the cakes and tarts are better than anything you can buy in Austria. And he suggested that anyone serious about spending time in Budapest should avoid the big hotels—they're as expensive as the ones in Montreal and New York—and get Ibusz, the government tourist office, to organize lodging in a private home. ""They have hundreds of houses on their list,"" he said. ""You can get a room for $10 or $15 a week. And the people will love you."" Mr. Nagy's call got me thinking. The story on Budapest was pretty good. I ran it because I liked it and it made me want to visit the city. But Mr. Nagy's right in a way. All travel pieces are subjective—they pretty well have to be—and no journalist has the time to try all the pastry shops in Budapest. The result can seem frustratingly incomplete to anyone who knows or loves the place we're describing. So in the future I'll tell you several weeks in advance about at least some of the places we'll be writing about in the Travel section, much as I've done with the Disney venture. Then if you have any tips or hints about what to see and what to avoid, you can send them to me here at The Gazette and I'll publish the best ones. Those ever-romantic folks at British Airways have cooked up a promotion scheme to get you to take the love of your life to London for Valentine's Day, which is OK if you like theatre, concerts, and cold rainy streets. Anyway, if you go to London on business or for fun between Feb. 11 and 14 and buy a ticket at ""an established fare,"" you'll be able to buy your travelling companion a return economy ticket for $199. Both passengers must travel on the same flights to and from London, stay in Britain at least seven days, book their trips at least 14 days before departure, and pay within 48 hours of booking. You have to come back before March 7 and there's a $30 surcharge for Saturday flights. If that sounds too cheap, consider instead the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. It's offering a romantic weekend for two from Feb. 16 to 18 that's designed for the man (or woman) with a decent-sized heart and a really huge wallet. Just $20,000 U. B-2 - tlx OXfCtta, Montreal, Saturday, January 6, 1990 DAVID W. PERKS BOB RICHARDSON NORMAN WEBSTER MEL MORRIS JOAN FRASER Publisher General Manager Editor Executive Managing Editor Editorial Page Editor Justice in Kahnawake Canada's justice system has poorly served native peoples. But the federal and provincial governments have taken a highly progressive step by opening talks about judicial autonomy with the Kahnawake Mohawk. Any arrangement reached there would set a precedent that could serve as a model for other native groups across Canada. Traditionally, the Mohawk system of justice differs substantially from Canada's. The Mohawk system is non-adversarial and consensus-oriented. In theory at least, emphasis is placed on making everyone winners and, for most offences, rehabilitating wrong-doers within the community. It certainly could be an improvement on Canada's system of letting even non-dangerous offenders rot in prisons where they teach each other how to be better criminals. The governments seem prepared to allow the Mohawk to exercise much greater judicial jurisdiction than they do now. (Kahnawake already has local justices of the peace to judge misdemeanors and settle small disputes.) Mohawk judges would try and sentence offenders whose crimes were committed on the reserve except perhaps those who committed the most serious offences and would settle civil cases according to their own custom. That would imply greater legislative jurisdiction for civil matters and possibly for criminal matters as well. But Mohawks who committed crimes outside Kahnawake would still be tried in Canadian courts. Many details remain to be ironed out. And in Kahnawake, where an armed and powerful group of self-declared traditionalists does not recognize the authority of the elected band council, it will be important that all parties recognize the legitimacy and authority of whatever judicial apparatus is set up. Appropriately, the consultations so far have included both main groups. Other traditionalists, who recognize neither the band council nor the Nation Office-linked Longhouse as legitimate, should be included as well. As things stand, the Nation Office-linked Longhouse does not seem likely to recognize any legislation passed by the band council. Longhouse supporters already are ignoring efforts by the band council to dissuade them from continuing their high-stakes bingo. So long as fundamental divisions remain within Kahnawake, it is hard to see how a new system can function effectively. Still, the talks are welcome. They can help defuse the tense stand-off between the bingo promoters and provincial authorities. And they raise hopes of a mutually beneficial expansion of native autonomy. If it works, that could be an important step to broader self-government. Incompetence may cost lives According to a law passed Jan. 1, Quebecers should be belting up in the back seats of their cars. But few Quebecers know there is such a law. The law officers whose job it is to enforce the law don't know how to enforce it because they haven't been told. And the ministry responsible for both the police and the traffic code seems to have washed its hands of the problem. Because the public doesn't know the rules and police forces are unsure of how they apply, the police are refusing to enforce the back seat belt law. And as long as this bureaucratic bungling goes on, people may die or suffer serious injury who could have been saved by seat belts. The problem starts with and can only be resolved by the Regie de l'assurance automobile du Quebec. It has the responsibility to inform the public and police about changes in the traffic code. It has conspicuously failed to do its job. For example, how do the regulations cover the fact that in most cars, three people can sit in the back seat and, in most cars, there are only two seat belts? The plan was that the RAAQ would launch a major publicity campaign before the law came into force to inform Quebec drivers and the police about the seat belt legislation. That never happened. The official reason is that the RAAQ decided instead to mount the campaign in April or May when, it said, more drivers were on the road. Only after a sharp statement from the Surete du Quebec has the RAAQ agreed to push forward the advertising campaign. It will now start in the next few days. Quebec is the last jurisdiction in Canada, and one of the last in North America, to legislate mandatory seat belts for the back seats of cars. Sadly, as well as being late in passing the life-saving law, the RAAQ has managed to pile confusion on incompetence in applying it. Bouquets and brickbats Bouquets and brickbats are awarded this week: To Canada's national junior hockey team, for scorning the easy way. It won the world championship Thursday when, in its final game, it defeated Czechoslovakia 2-1; but the gold medal wasn't certain until Sweden, in another game, knocked the Soviet Union out of the running by tying the Soviets with a goal with one second remaining. To the Soviet Education Ministry, for seeing the light. It no longer will require university students to study Marxism-Leninism to qualify for a degree. To Charles Turner of Anaheim, Calif, for tasteless and perhaps dangerous showboating. On New Year's Eve, the 64-year-old physician used anesthesia and then forceps to thwart nature and ensure the delivery of a baby just into the new year. The idea was to present it as a newborn at a midnight religious service. The baby was duly born 15 seconds into 1990, whereupon Dr. Turner ran 150 feet with it to the service next door. To Rick Gibson, a Vancouver artist, for dubious aesthetics. His latest work involves, at last report, using a 25-kilo block of concrete today to crush a rat named Sniffy in front of the city's main downtown library. Mr. Gibson dismisses the protests of animal lovers: ""Why do they want to save Sniffy? Why don't they go down to the local pet stores and save the rats that are offered to the fangs and throats of snakes? This rat has been raised to die prematurely as living pet food."" To Poland's Lech Walesa, for generosity. He is donating his 1983 Nobel peace prize money, about $240,000, to help provide emergency help for health services, social welfare, and education. To Maj.-Gen. Ramon Montano, for seeking the silver lining. Gen. Montano, the national police commander in the Philippines, says that coup attempts in his country, though unwelcome, are an effective means of reducing crime. He said car thefts, for example, declined to 1½ a day from the usual nine in December, when army mutineers launched a nine-day coup attempt. ALL OUR YESTERDAYS The tuque is yet to be beaten for efficiency. With the coming of cold weather, the tuque has made its annual reappearance in Montreal. It is not only one of the simplest, least expensive, and most effective means of keeping the head warm, it is also one of the oldest. The tuque seems to be a French Canadian creation. In Webster's dictionary, it is one of the very few words identified as French Canadian in origin. Webster defines a tuque as ""a cap consisting of a knitted cylindrical bag with tapered ends, worn by thrusting one end inside the other."" Early visitors to Montreal from other countries had never seen a tuque before, and were at a loss how to describe it. They groped after something they knew that might seem comparable to it. Often they called it ""a nightcap."" The comparison was not unreasonable. Many men wore nightcaps in bed to protect their heads in cold and draughty bedrooms. The tuque, like every other article of the rural French Canadian's winter clothing, was homemade. French Canadian households, with their family industries, were almost entirely self-sufficient. Wool for tuques was provided by sheep on the French Canadian farm. It was made into yarn on the family's spinning wheel. From this yarn, tuques were knitted, and cloth was woven for the long winter coats. Hides from cattle were tanned and made into moccasins or high boots. Another household product for winter wear was the sash, the ceinture flechee. These sashes, in brilliant colors, were often many feet long. They were tightly wound around the waist, two or three times, with the fringe falling down to one side. Making these winter costumes was carried on by the women of the household. Much of the work was done in the summer, in preparation for the inevitable winter. The Irish traveller, Isaac Weld, saw the women at their spinning wheels on his way westward from Lachine in the summer of 1796: ""We again set off on foot partly for the pleasure of stopping occasionally to chat with the lively French girls that sat spinning in groups at the doors of the cottages."" The homemade winter costume, with its tuque, was so well adapted to the needs of the winter that it became almost a national costume. It was standardized into a sort of winter uniform. These winter costumes continued to be made in French Canadian homes even into the 20th century. Such family industries, however, had survived only in more remote areas, as in the north country, or along the Lower St. Lawrence. By the 1870s many French Canadians living near cities had been giving up homemade clothing for the machine-made products of the big factories. The change had been noticed in 1871 by a writer in the American magazine, Scribner's Monthly. ""Home-made clothing has given away considerably to the cheapness of mill manufacture; the growing taste for finery and colors tempts a more frequent visit to the village or city shops; and with the growth and development of the country, the French Canadian family imbibes a love for better apparel than their own humble ingenuity and industry can produce."" But the French Canadian winter costume found a new future when it was adopted by Montreal's snowshoers. For the snowshoe clubs, it was the ideal costume for their long snowy tramps on cold winter nights, when they went over Mount Royal and back, or on long-distance tramps to Lachine or Sault au Recollet. The Montreal Snow Shoe Club, oldest of them all, became known as ""the Tuques Bleues."" It was founded as early as 1840. What its costume was in its early years is uncertain; but at the annual meeting on Dec. 4, 1869, it adopted ""a uniform cap, viz, blue 'tuque' with scarlet tassel."" The snowshoe club costume (though generally machine-made) was closely modelled on the old French Canadian pattern—the ""blanket coat,"" the moccasins, the sash. But the chief symbol and identification was the club's blue tuque. As other snowshoe clubs were formed in Montreal, they, too, adopted tuques, but the tuque of each club had its distinctive color. Tuques of the St. George's Snow-shoe Club were white with a purple tassel; those of the Emerald Snow-shoe Club (mostly young men of the St. Patrick's Association) were green; those of the YMCA Club were cardinal. When the Snowshoe Union was formed in 1908, its 34 clubs displayed tuques of 34 different colors or combinations of colors. Members of the Montreal Snow Shoe Club, with the prestige of their seniority, had become not only the ""Tuques Bleues,"" but the ""Old Tuques Bleues."" In all the club's hearty snowshoe songs, its tuques were extolled. One chorus, for example, went: Now chant a rhyme, while the words keep time To the tramp of our swift snowshoe And we'll sing a song, as we march along In praise of our old Tuque Bleue. From time to time the Montreal Snow Shoe Club gave a concert in one of the city's principal halls, with the proceeds going to charity. The halls would be crowded to their ""utmost capacity."" Ushers were members in the club's costume, with their ""tuques bleues."" They went ""flitting about, imparting a variety and brilliancy to the scene never surpassed."" At one of these concerts, members filed onto the stage and opened with a solo by one of the group, with everyone joining in the chorus of the ""Tuque Bleue"" song. The audience demanded an encore. During the last chorus, ""Hurrah for the wearing of the bright tuque bleue,"" all the snowshoers took off their tuques and waved them—a crescendo of music and motion. Even when snowshoeing in Montreal declined as a sport, the tuque found ways of survival. It was often preferred by skiers, skaters, tobogganers, and by those who worked outdoors or did winter walking. This endurance of the ancient tuque, through all changes of time and fashion, was far more than a taste for tradition and the picturesque. The tuque, functional from its beginnings, remained so. The natural suitability of the old tuque for the rigorous Canadian winters was commended by one of the most prominent Montreal doctors of the 19th century, Sir William Hingston. He praised it in an address on ""The Climate of Canada,"" delivered to the Montreal Natural History Society about 110 years ago. The rural French Canadian, he said, was always comfortably and suitably clothed in his homemade apparel. Above all, he did well to wear the traditional tuque. The tuque, in Sir William's medical opinion, was the ideal head covering in cold weather. It was ""light and porous,"" keeping the head ""sufficiently covered and warm and, at the same time, dry."" It was far preferable to some other types of headgear that keep the head ""hot and moist."" Members of the old Montreal Snow Shoe Club would have agreed. They had put their tuques to severest tests in the worst of storms. When the club gave its concerts, fridge stove, heating and hot water included, extra high ceilings, 937-2190.

The story begins with clusters of down are used as fillings for most duvets. A cluster is one piece of down and comes from the underside of a duck or goose. Unlike a feather, a down cluster has no quill shaft, just a central point at which hundreds of filaments are attached. Furthermore, it has excellent insulation properties. Its 3-dimensional structure lets it trap more air than other materials. GUARANTEED FOR LIFE! The quality of all the Linen Chest's down duvets is unquestionable. And, every duvet sold comes with a lifetime guarantee! The finest casing construction. Goose vs Duck Down: The test of true quality. There are numerous differences between goose and duck down. But the one that really counts is loft. Loft is tested by measuring the density of one ounce of down. Goose down tests higher than duck. It is particularly desirable because it combines superior insulation with lightweight comfort. The casing is as important as the filling. Utmost care and attention are given to the casing construction. The casing channels are composed of 2"" vertical wall baffles. They keep the down evenly distributed to eliminate cold spots. And, by varying the width of each channel (6"" or 9""), the fill weight varies accordingly. Casing that 'breathes'. Our 100% cotton cambric high-thread count casing is very special and exclusive to the Linen Chest. The long fibre combed cotton is tightly woven and pressure-rollered to make it down-proof. Yet it's air permeable for extra comfort and lightweight durability.

Although the story eventually degenerates into an old-fashioned good guys, bad guys, car-chase-foot-race-and-leap-across-a-chasm sequence, it never loses its punch. domestic politics, suggesting that the country could run itself; his interest was in foreign affairs. Patton was his favorite film, Teddy Roosevelt his favorite former president. He envied the dash and charisma of the Kennedys and ordered the tapping of his brother Donald's phone. Ambrose's book is an accounting of such facts: a well-researched, blow-by-blow description of Nixon's political life. That Nixon: Volume Two is vaguely unsatisfying is not entirely Ambrose's fault. After all, most of what Nixon did in office has been explored and dissected by other writers, by Nixon himself, and by almost everyone who worked at the White House. Nixon was largely without a private life; there were no rutting scandals, no private intrigues. Ambrose presents BEST-SELLERS FICTION 1. Solomon Gursky Was Here, Mordecai Richler (Viking) (1) 9 2.

He's infused it with sparse, acerbic dialogue and he's filled the book with a host of memorable characters. Straight, No Chaser even makes Toronto seem like a hip place. Be warned: Maj.-Gen. Richard Rohmer, perhaps the last professional cold warrior in the country, is at it again. This time the Toronto QC and retired officer bludgeons readers with Red Arctic (Fitzhenry and Whiteside, 167 pp, $22.95), the latest in his growing arsenal of abominable fiction. Red Arctic is based on the highly dubious proposition that the Soviet Union would lay claim to Canada's Great White North after the body of a Russian explorer who sailed the high Arctic 250 years ago is unearthed from the frozen tundra. That's as silly as suggesting that Iceland has a territorial claim to Newfoundland because Vikings settled at L'Anse aux Meadows in the 11th century. Never mind. The thin premise merely enables Rohmer to engage in a diatribe against the Mulroney government's cancellation of an $8-billion program for 12 nuclear-powered submarines. Or, as one of the protagonists so eloquently puts it: ""Of all the dumb things, not to go for a nuclear-powered sub."" The people in the book, as they say in the movies, bear no resemblance to characters either living or dead. They include a Ukrainian-Canadian Mountie; a female Russian academic (she's there for a perfunctory lust interest); a duplicitous, foul-mouthed Canadian prime minister; and a United States president who is given words to say the political Nixon, the only Nixon, and there is a sense of deja vu at most turns. Ambrose's book is a balanced account, according Nixon credit for his successes and exploring his failures, but its strength lies in the context it provides. Politicians are formed by events (or, latterly, by public relations) rather than the opposite, and Nixon: Volume Two is a deconstruction of Nixon's presidency, his tenuous route to the White House, what he promised and what he failed to accomplish. The same could be done, and has been, with other presidencies. Every president is guilty of failed promises, random vulgarities, even minor crimes, but no one has ever looked as guilty as Dick. Despite the listing of Nixon's many failings and a detailed analysis of his vengeful, feudal governing style, Nixon emerges as a stubbornly sympathetic character. How can that be? Perhaps it is because Nixon, awkward, funny-looking, and academically undistinguished, triumphed with little other than ambition, energy, and will. It's not a Hollywood-fashioned triumph of the little guy, more a vindication of the American middle class: fundamentally decent and hard-working, if narrow, humorless, and self-righteous. And Nixon was fundamentally decent, despite his opposition to civil rights, his use of thugs to control hecklers, his warring instincts. Well, that's the problem with Nixon: you can't take flattery very far. Still, there is a streak of decency in him, a brittle, Quaker rectitude that surfaces on occasion, usually a political occasion. Ambrose has rounded up the usual warts, but he has dragged some of the man into the light as well. It is a queasy thought that Nixon may need several more volumes to catalogue his political life.

Bob Skelly asked in the Commons A Nova Scotia royal commission report released last week criticized two of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal judges Justice Leonard Pace and former chief justice Ian Mac-Keigan who dealt with the case Since the Appeal Court judges were appointed by the federal government, they are subject to review by the judicial council Skelly said Lewis should direct the council to investigate But Lewis said he needed more time to study the report The opposition accused him once again of foot-dragging Marshall has had a heck of a lot of time in jail and out awaiting process, said Skelly, the NDP Indian affairs critic, outside the Commons Further delay is simply further justice denied On Monday, the opposition demanded action on the report's recommendation to set up a native justice system in Nova Scotia MacKeigan is singled out for steering the federal government away from granting Marshall an outright pardon in 1982 by recommending that Jean Chretien, then justice minister, send the case to the court of appeal instead The decision put the onus on Marshall to prove his innocence at a time when Chretien's officials were aware the 1971 murder conviction was flimsy at best Also, new evidence could not be heard on why the wrongful conviction occurred in the first place In the case of Pace, the report said he should not have sat in judgment of Marshall in 1983 because he was Nova Scotia attorney general at the time The appeal court cleared Marshall in 1983 but said he was partially to blame for what happened to him It's too late to register Pre-Calculus Calculus I & II Math Refresher Functions I Interior Design General Chemistry II Intermediate Chemistry Introduction to Chemistry Electricity & Magnetism Wave Motion & Modern Physics Intermediate Physics Mechanics Drafting Blueprint Reading D budget law, the deficit is supposed to fall to $64 billion this year and be wiped out completely by the end of the 1993 fiscal year SOUTHAM NEWS lj Mm f Wilson Budget leak Who's bugging the chief?

Default,347,"LOS ANGELES DAILY NEWS LOS ANGELES It doesn't take a lot of force to swing a golf club but swinging one accurately takes strength and flexibility attributes which, if lacking, can result in both errant shots and a host of painful injuries. Most golfers especially weekend players have no idea how damaging golf can be, particularly to unconditioned muscles. The truth is, golf is as athletic (if not as strenuous) as baseball or football. And while golf is not as bruising as other sports, it does often result in injured backs, shoulders, elbows and knees. For the once-a-week player or for the golfer who is just starting up after a winter of relative inactivity the risk is heightened, as underused muscles are suddenly compelled to perform. Q: I'm an adequate golfer, and I especially like to play on business trips with clients. What's the best way to improve my game? A: Weekend golfers interested in increasing endurance, accuracy and driving distance can do so by learning more about stretching and strengthening those muscles that play the most important roles in the golf swing. Walking 18 holes is not enough. Walking 18 holes and spending time on the driving range isn't enough. A simple program of stretching and strengthening exercises can help both pros and amateurs, young and old, to drive the ball farther, play with better consistency, develop strength, endurance and flexibility, and significantly lower the risk of injury. A specific conditioning program will improve performance at every level of the game and help those who do incur injuries to recover more quickly. The goal of stretching exercises is to loosen the muscles around the joints, enabling them to move through a great range of motion. Muscles tend to shorten unless stretched on a regular basis. They work more efficiently, and with less risk of strain or injury, when loosened. On days of course play, stretching exercises should be done 15 to 20 minutes before tee-off, because the value of stretching decreases when more than 20 minutes pass from the time of the exercise to the time of actual play. For maximum benefit, stretching exercises should be done every day. If performed regularly, improvements should be noted in two to three weeks; improvements will include less soreness after playing and greater flexibility during the swing. After finishing the exercises, try swinging a club 10 or 12 times so you use your body's improved flexibility through the range of motion you will use on the golf course. Shoulder muscles work as a group. Q: I've heard a lot of talk about the rotator cuff muscles; what exactly are they, and why are they important to a good golf game? A: The rotator cuff consists of four shoulder muscles that work as a group during all phases of the golf swing the backswing, during the acceleration into the ball, and on the follow-through. They are perhaps the most essential to an accurate swing; and they are also the most prone to injury. Research has found that the rotator cuff muscles need to be worked separately from the rest of the arm muscles to achieve maximum results and help prevent injuries. Two excellent stretching exercises developed from the research are the following: B The rhomboid stretch: This part of your back is difficult to stretch and susceptible to injury, especially with golfers. Standing or sitting, reach both arms around your chest and try to grasp the opposite shoulder blade with each hand. Drop your chin toward your chest. Inhale, holding onto your shoulder blades for a count of 10. You should feel the stretch along the border of your shoulder blades. The posterior cuff stretch: While standing, stretch the back portion of the shoulder joint by pulling the left arm across the body, under the chin and as far back as possible without rotating the torso. Hold for 10 to 15 seconds; repeat five to six times, then switch arms and repeat. Dr. Frank Jobe specializes in sports medicine at the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic. Among its patients are athletes from the Los Angeles Dodgers, Lakers, Kings and Rams. The first 18 holes of spring can be among the most dangerous for a golfer who is out of shape, specialists in sports-related medicine say. Fitness in problem? Education is solution, doctors say ROSA SALTER ALLENTOWN MORNING CALL ALLENTOWN, Pa. Just a few years ago, says physical therapist Gail Levine, when someone came into a doctor's office with an injured back, the doctor would probably send the patient back to bed. But now, she said, doctors are more likely to send the same kind of patient back to school. To back school, that is. With the growing emphasis on preventive health care and the risks and rising cost of back surgery, more doctors are prescribing education as a treatment for back injuries. And back schools are becoming the education of choice. Started in Sweden about 10 years ago, back schools are now springing up across the continent to help meet demand. An estimated 80 to 90 per cent of North Americans will seriously injure their backs at some point in their lives. Levine runs one such school as part of her Allentown physical-therapy practice, and others are conducted at doctors' offices, sports-medicine clinics and rehabilitation centres. While the techniques and structure of the individual back schools may differ, the courses have the same aim: teaching people more about the anatomical structure that stands them up, sits them down and bends them over 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The hope is that the patients' newfound knowledge will give them power the power to avoid reinjuring their backs. And for many people, going to back school turns out to be quite an education. ""It was good to show you the right way to do simple things, things you don't even think of, like how to vacuum a house, and shop and lift groceries and bend over,"" said Dennis Kochenash, 44, a former heavy-equipment operator, who attended back school after he hurt his back at work twice in eight months and required surgery. ""Like there's a right and a wrong way to get out of a car,"" he added. ""I never knew that stuff before."" ""Most people know more about their cars than they do about their backs,"" said Karen Graffman, director of the back-school program at Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Hospital in Allentown. ""It's so misunderstood because it's a complex system, and unlike the wrist or fingers or knees, it's made up of internal joints you can't put your hands on it and see if it's swollen,"" added Dennis Dougherty, a physical therapist who teaches back-school principles at a rehab centre in Bethlehem, Pa. ""If your knuckle is swollen, you can see it and rest it, but if one of the small joints in your spine is hurt, you can't see it and you probably don't know what to rest anyway."" ""There's an old saying that whoever designed the back must have been asleep."" According to Dougherty, adults of all ages can be affected by back injuries, but most frequently it is people between the ages of 35 and 50 who will have their activities limited because of problems. The spinal column Though called the column, the spine is actually more like a spring that is shaped. This curvy shape makes it a great shock absorber; you could never even walk on hard ground, much less run or jump, if your spine were a straight column because all the jarring would travel right up your back to your head. Back aches When your back hurts, it could be any number of things. Your discs may be at fault; they can deteriorate as a normal part of aging, giving you a mild backache or some stiffness. Or, they can rupture or herniate, which means the soft center of the disc protrudes through its fibrous casing and hits a nerve painfully. Or, the pain could be musculoskeletal, like a strain of your back muscles that causes spasms and inflammation. Nerve The spinal cord sends out 31 pairs of nerves between the vertebrae that branch and rebranch out to the rest of the body. This network of nerves is how the body communicates with itself, transmitting signals to and from the brain and spinal cord. Herniated disc pain occurs when a disc comes into contact with a nerve. Taking care of your back You can be kind to your back by staying within your proper weight range; obesity can stress your lower back. Lifting a heavy object can injure your back; you should bend at the knees rather than the waist to let your legs rather than your back do the work. High heels can throw your back out of alignment and put too much pressure on your lower back. Sitting for long periods of time is stressful to the back so get up once in a while and walk around. Four in five of us suffer some kind of back pain during our lives. No wonder! With 126 vertebrae, plus muscles, nerves and ligaments, there's a lot that can go wrong with their backs. But sooner or later, he said, just about everyone will have back trouble the result, some experts say, of man's decision to walk upright, even though his body wasn't designed for it. But rather than blame our prehistoric ancestors, Dougherty said, many experts today trace the overwhelming incidence of back pain to sedentary lifestyles that have weakened the muscles that hold the back in place. ""Actually, sitting is the worst thing you can do for your back,"" said Dr. Chris Lynch, a specialist in body mechanics. According to Lynch, a back injury may appear to come on suddenly a secretary may bend over to pick up a piece of paper that falls off her desk and develop excruciating pain; a weekend golfer may take an easy practice swing and have his back go into spasms. But a back injury typically has been many years in the making, the culmination of repeated, subtle abuse. ""It's from being out of shape and overweight and sitting badly and standing lousy and slouching all those things that your mother told you not to do that we hurt our backs,"" Lynch said. Even a habit like smoking because it causes repeated coughing, which can strain back muscles can be a culprit in back injuries, he added. Fortunately, Lynch said, only a few back injuries involve incapacitating damage to a disc, the back's shock-absorber system, and therefore are severe enough to require surgery. Most back problems, he said, involve either simple sprains or strains and will heal with time, exercise and proper rest. ""If there's anything that's happened in the last 10 years, it's that people have become more cautious in recommending surgery,"" he said. For patients, Levine said, back school provides reassurance that they can work up to doing certain activities again and gives simple tips on how to take strain off the back while standing, reaching, lifting, sitting or even sleeping. Students get to practice techniques while in class, and Levine's course uses a slide-audio program developed by a national organization, the American Back School, to teach anatomy. The program stresses the concept of the ""locked-in back"" as a means of safeguarding it from future injury. The idea, Levine said, is to maintain the back in the normal ""S"" shape it would have while standing straight with curves inward at the neck, outward in the upper back and inward in the lower back during activities that involve bending, reaching or lifting. The advice, she said, runs counter to what many people have been taught, especially about how to lift. ""People tend to lift with the load too far away from their body and they tend to hunch over and lift,"" she said. ""Or they will lift and twist with heavy weights, and twisting is one thing you just don't do. It exerts a tremendous amount of torque on the disc, so you have two kinds of pressure on the disc at the same time the regular disc pressure (from standing) and the torque, and that's going to enable the disc to herniate easier."" Dougherty, meanwhile, uses a different program designed by the Back School of Atlanta. The course stresses similar techniques but also underlying factors of diet, posture, weight and stress. ""The biggest thing is (being) overweight,"" Lynch said. ""For every pound on your stomach that's five pounds on your back."" Overweight patients with back problems, he added, are ""just kidding themselves"" if they think they can take care of the back injury without losing weight. The Atlanta approach does not stress the locked-in back because it seems awkward for some people to learn, Dougherty said. Instead, he said, the course uses a modified ""straight-back"" approach. Both Levine's and Dougherty's programs also use simple exercises specifically tailored to strengthen and relax the back muscles. Patients are also encouraged to strengthen other parts of their bodies like their arms and legs so they can use those muscles more when performing activities that might strain their backs. ""If you get rid of your (acute) back pain, you'd better start walking or swimming or whatever to maintain the muscle tone,"" Dougherty stated. ""Once you injure your back, your back is your Achilles heel and unless you exercise, it will come back to haunt you."" Correct treatment of burn varies with its degree JUDE LOGAN HEALTH & FITNESS NEWS SERVICE LOS ANGELES There are many kinds of burns, ranging from finger blisters to third-degree burns covering large portions of the body. In assessing the severity of a burn, physicians look at two factors: how much of the skin's surface is affected and the depth of the injury. First-degree burns affect the outermost layer of the skin, which becomes red and may swell a little. Because the nerve endings in this layer of skin are irritated, pain can be intense. Sun exposure and brief contact with a hot item are common causes of first-degree burns. Second-degree burns involve deeper skin layers, which ooze, blister and swell. Intense sun exposure, prolonged contact with a hot object, scalding liquids and gasoline are common causes of second-degree burns. Third-degree burns actually destroy all the layers of skin, which become white or charred. Because the nerve endings are destroyed, there is little or no pain. A small third-degree burn can be hard to distinguish when it is surrounded by a larger area of a second- or first-degree burn. These burns are usually the result of fire, electrical shock or contact with corrosive chemicals. Fourth-degree burns damage the underlying body tissues, tendons and connective tissue, in addition to destroying the skin. These burns are the result of fire, explosion or electrical shock. You can treat superficial first- and second-degree burns yourself unless they cover more than 10 per cent of the body an entire arm or the face, for instance. Then prompt medical attention is imperative. Generally, these burns heal well, without scarring or discoloration. Rapid first aid for burns is essential. Do not apply butter or other household remedies; they are ineffective and may cause infection. Applying cold water until the pain subsides can keep the burn from worsening. With a sterile cloth, gently pat the area dry; don't press down on the burn. You can treat first-degree burns with pain-relief lotions or sprays. Never open blisters or remove dead skin, especially sunburned skin. When in doubt, treat a serious-looking burn as a third-degree burn and get professional help. Third- and fourth-degree burns are physically devastating. Even with expert medical care they can be fatal. When the body's protective coat is damaged, there is danger of infection, acute ulcers, inflammation of the kidneys and spinal cord, anemia and pneumonia. If left untreated, the body could go into shock. There are some things you can do until the paramedics arrive: Remove restrictive clothing or jewelry. If clothing is stuck to the burn, leave it alone. Apply cold, wet compresses with a clean cloth. If the burn is less than two inches across, submerge it in cold water. Never use ice on burns this severe, because the sudden cooling can intensify the shock. Check to see whether the victim is having trouble breathing. You may have to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Cover the burn with a sterile, clean cloth. Electrical burns come in twos one where the electricity enters the body and one where it exits. Look for two wounds and treat them both as third-degree burns. For chemical burns, remove any contaminated clothing, including shoes or socks. Shower or hose the area immediately with cold water not too forcefully. Water will dilute the chemical and flush it away. Both chemical and electrical burns should be treated by a doctor, regardless of how benign they might seem. 845-8055 AHUNTSIC S' lower duplex, large, sunny, garage, cold room and laundry room, near metro 422-7113 AHUNTSIC: 31 apl, including fridge and stove Immediate N New England High 5 Low near -1 Rain is expected to end this morning with scattered flurries developing this afternoon Lower North Shore High 6 Low near -1 Cloudy with wet snow changing to rain in the afternoon Gaspe High 8 Low near 4 Cloudy skies with periods of rain throughout the region Almanac Max Min Yesterday 4 1 Year ago yesterday 4 -3 Average this date 9 0 Canada UaxMi, World Whitehorse Clear 4 -8 Amsterdam Pcldy 10 4 Yellowknife Windy -5 -21 Athens City 22 12 Vancouver Rain 13 7 Beijing City 20 8 Prince Rupert City 11 5 Buenos Aires Na 26 17 Kamloops City 14 7 Copenhagen City 8 2 Edmonton Clear 6 -7 Dublin City 13 6 Calgary Clear 5 -6 Frankfurt Clear 11 -1 Saskatoon Clear 3 -6 Hong Kong City 25 19 Regina Clear 2 -6 Jerusalem Clear 20 12 Winnipeg Clear 5 -10 Lisbon Clear 18 9 Thunder Bay City 2 -10 London City 13 8 Sudbury Pcldy 1 -5 Madrid Clear 12 5 Toronto Pcldy 3 -5 Mexico City Clear 28 12 Fredericton Snow 2 -4 Moscow Clear 7 -3 Kalifa Rain 6 3 New Delhi Clear 34 20 Charlottetown Snow 2 -4 Paris Clear 12 2 St. John's Rain 3 2 Rome City 20 13 sym Na 21 18 United States Vienna Pcldy 10 2 Atlanta City 18 4 Resorts Boston Rain 15 2 Acapulco Clear 33 26 Chicago City 3 -6 Barbados City 30 28 Cincinnati Snow 6 -6 Dayton City 21 na Dallas City 20 7 Havana City 29 22 Denver City 13 3 Honolulu City 21 19 Los Angeles City 21 13 Kingston City 33 27 New York Rain 15 3 Las Vegas Clear 28 12 Phoenix Clear 34 18 Miami City 24 24 St. Louis Clear 10 0 Myrtle Beach City 28 na San Francisco Clear 19 9 Nassau City 29 23 Washington Rain 19 5 Tampa City 27 21 Lot yLZiij Mill EH L High hmin Lew Prtaauni Front Cold Front SMontry Front Trough For free weather information, updated four times a day, please call Gazette Info-Line, 521-8600, code: 6800 North American weather maps by Weather Central Act now before price of Gazette home delivery goes up.

Lawyers, notaries go toe-to-toe over revision of law code CANADIAN PRESS Quebec lawyers and notaries are engaged in a war of words over a planned overhaul of the province's legal system. The notaries say they fear the impending revisions in the works for nearly 30 years will lead to a more litigious society and encroach on their turf. Jean Lambert, president of the Board of Notaries of Quebec, charges the lawyers are seeking to feather their own nests by requiring the services of lawyers to legalize every act and action. Andre Gauthier, president of the Quebec Bar Association, retorts that Quebec can get along without notaries. ""There's nothing a notary does that lawyers couldn't do."" Relations between the bar and the notaries always somewhat strained have reached such a low ebb that the notaries have taken their differences public with full-page newspaper ads. Unlike the rest of Canada whose legal system is based on English common law, Quebec is governed by the Civil Code of Lower Canada, inspired by the French Napoleonic Code. Under the system, notaries traditionally have handled matters dealing with the Civil Code, such as marital and family law, wills, contracts and mortgages while lawyers have busied themselves with the Criminal Code. But the distinctions between their activities have become increasingly blurred with lawyers performing many of the tasks traditionally performed by notaries. Both lawyers and notaries have law degrees but most notaries have not written bar exams that would permit them to do litigation. When the Quiet Revolution swept through Quebec in the 1960s, the cabinet of Premier Jean Lesage established a legislature committee to update the code which has undergone little change since its adoption in 1866. Last year, the Bourassa government decided the time had finally come to put the revisions into effect but ran into immediate opposition from both the notaries and the bar. The bar won changes to the revisions and has decided to support the government's plans to impose them on Aug. 1, 1991. The board of notaries left out in the cold began its advertising blitz against the revisions several weeks ago. It has collected from its members a war chest of $3 million to finance its fight. What the notaries want, bar president Gauthier contends, is an increase in their legal privileges and protection against competition from lawyers written into the new code. ""We will not agree to endanger the reform in order to preserve the raison d'être of the notaries,"" Gauthier said. Lambert replied that the proposed changes will lead to the Americanization of the provincial legal system and that will prove more costly for Quebecers. Quebec law is ""heading in one direction that of new ways to go to court,"" Lambert said. THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 11, 1990 Quebec told to stay out of construction dispute GAZETTE QUEBEC BUREAU QUEBEC A coalition of construction unions yesterday urged the government not to be too hasty in using a decree to end their labor dispute with the Association des Entrepreneurs en Construction du Quebec. At a news conference, representatives of construction unions representing 100,000 workers said the builders' association has yet to start bargaining in good faith and is counting on the government to step in as it has in the past. ""It's clear they want the same thing as in the past, for Quebec to intervene in the name of the economy,"" said Yves Pard, a construction official with the Quebec Federation of Labor. ""But the construction (industry) isn't an essential service, it isn't a hospital. Construction workers are always penalized in the name of the economy."" The government decree currently governing work conditions of construction workers expires April 30. The coalition of unions affiliated with the QFL, the Confederation of National Trade Unions and the Conseil Provincial Internationale des Metiers de la Construction is threatening a general strike May 1 if it can't reach a settlement. The unions tabled their contract demands July 14. Labor Minister Yves Seguin named a conciliator last week. Pare said they aren't against working with the conciliator but don't feel the employers are taking the process seriously. The association represents 18,000 contractors province-wide. The unions want raises of 3 per cent above the cost of living in a two-year contract and a one-hour cut in their work week without loss of pay. No leave after adoption Rights commission to investigate firing CANADIAN PRESS HULL The Quebec Human Rights Commission plans to investigate a complaint by a city employee in nearby Aylmer who was fired for staying home with a newly adopted baby. Louize Rancourt says she would be satisfied with the return of her job as council secretary or with some financial compensation. Pierre Des Chenes, commission director for the Outaouais region, announced the investigation Monday. But he plans to try to mediate the conflict first. The 40-year-old woman was fired in August, three months after starting her $25,000-a-year job. When she asked for 17 weeks of unpaid leave, city manager Denis Hubert offered her a week. Rancourt had been waiting to adopt for 10 years. The city contends Rancourt was on probation when she adopted 6-week-old Daniel. Her request was not covered by the union contract. However, city officials acknowledged another employee was granted a leave after adopting. ""Right now, the commission can't force Aylmer to do anything because it can only make recommendations. But a new law that will come into effect this summer will change that,"" Des Chenes said.

E 4 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 11, 1990 Spices liven up mini lamb patties In the region of France where I grew up lamb was widely eaten, and I still have a great fondness for it. In the Quick recipe below for lamb patties, the ground meat is seasoned with garlic and cumin and the patties are small, four or five to each dinner. To my taste, almonds have an affinity for lamb so the accompanying rice dish contains almonds, along with raisins and cinnamon. Lamb Patties with Mushroom Sauce 1½ pounds (600 g) ground lean lamb 3 tablespoons (45 mL) olive oil 1½ cups (375 mL) finely chopped onions 1 teaspoon (5 mL) finely chopped garlic 1 teaspoon (5 mL) ground cumin ½ cup (125 mL) finely chopped cilantro or parsley ½ cup (125 mL) fine fresh breadcrumbs 1 egg lightly beaten salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 1 tablespoon (15 mL) butter ½ pound (200 g) fresh mushrooms, finely sliced 1½ tablespoons (25 mL) finely chopped shallots ½ cup (50 mL) dry white wine ½ cup (125 mL) chopped peeled fresh tomatoes or canned crushed tomatoes ¾ cup (175 mL) fresh or canned chicken broth 1 teaspoon (5 mL) chopped fresh tarragon or ½ teaspoon (2 mL) dried 2 teaspoons (10 mL) arrowroot or cornstarch 1 tablespoon (15 mL) water Place the lamb in a mixing bowl. Heat two tablespoons (25 mL) of the oil in a small skillet and add the onions and garlic. Cook briefly, stirring, until wilted. Sprinkle with cumin and stir, blending well. Cool briefly. Scrape the onion mixture into the lamb. Add the cilantro, breadcrumbs, egg, salt and pepper. Blend well with fingers and shape the mixture into 20 patties. Set aside. For the mushroom sauce, heat the butter in a saucepan and add the mushrooms, shallots, salt and pepper. Cook on medium-high heat. How bubbles give Passover a lift There's a fascinating bit of history attached to using beaten egg whites in cakes for the Jewish spring holiday of Passover. Jews who fled from Egypt more than 3,000 years ago had no time to allow their traditional yeast breads to rise. In commemorating their arduous journey to freedom, the eight-day celebration of Passover still prohibits the use of products leavened with baking powder or yeast. So the masses of air bubbles in beaten egg whites become the basis of spectacular tortes and Passover cakes using matzo meal, nuts and various flavorings. The fine wires of a whip or blades of a beater stretch the delicate lattice of egg proteins and water to encase the captured air. Egg whites are more flexible at room temperature so they beat to greater heights than cold eggs. Thousands of large bubbles quickly become millions of smaller ones as the foam expands to six or eight times its original volume. Cream of tartar and salt are often called for. But wait until the whites have been beaten to the foamy stage. Adding them earlier delays foaming. Cream of tartar keeps the cake structure from collapsing before the foam sets in the oven. It's thought the acid coagulates the protein film that surrounds each air bubble, stabilizing the foam. It also imparts acidity to the batter, making the cake whiter and its texture finer. Sugar added slowly, starting when eggs are still at the foamy stage, also stabilizes the foam. Sugar travels to the walls of the air bubbles, keeping the water from Johanna Burkhard's New Waves, Is BRUNCH from 11 a.m. to DINNER from 5 p.m. to (WW $1 R95 Children 10 and under Half-Price Reservations: 878-4569 PWCEBONAVENTURE, 1,1 C 5 WlaneSI-ous effort to pinch a win over Phils ASSOCIATED PRESS THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 11, 1990 gives Cubs CHICAGO Marvell Wynne's pinch single with two out in the eighth inning saved the Chicago Cubs a season-opening 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies yesterday on a cold and windy afternoon.

Default,348,"The world outdoor record for 1,500 metres is 3:29.46, by Said Aouita of Morocco. Elliott won the same event at last month's Commonwealth Games in New Zealand in 3:33.39. Peter Elliott Indoor mark Oldtimers strike out Leo Durocher and Phil Rizzuto were among those left out in the cold as the veterans committee of the Baseball Hall of Fame decided, for the second time in three years, not to add any oldtimers to the shrine. Durocher not being elected may not augur well for Pete Rose. Many felt if Durocher had been elected, despite his one-year suspension for ties with known gamblers, then Rose might have hope when he's eligible. Now it will depend on the climate at the time Rose goes before the writers. The committee met for more than five hours in Tampa and took three ballots before adjourning without a consensus. The candidates needed 11 of the 14 votes cast to earn a selection to the Hall of Fame. That leaves infielder Joe Morgan and pitcher Jim Palmer, who were elected last month by the Baseball Writers Association of America, as the lone new members of the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.

Time was that when you wanted to bake whole-grain breads you had to wait around all day for the bread to rise. No longer. The quality of yeast has improved and so have the methods of baking bread. Although the most popular yeast used at home is fast-rising dry yeast, there is a newcomer called quick-rise instant yeast which lets dough rise in half the time. When making bread, be careful not to work in too much flour or the bread will be heavy. Depending on the humidity of the flour used, you may need to use less or more than the amount called for in a recipe. It's also important to measure flour correctly. Stir flours first, then spoon into a dry measure and use a knife or spatula to level the top. Temperature of liquid ingredients is also critical. Liquids that are too hot will kill the action of yeast and dough will not rise. Low temperatures will shock the yeast and it will not have its full leavening strength. A thermometer is the best way to ensure accuracy. For more information, call the Fleischmann's Yeast Baker's Help Line at 1-800-227-6202. Recipe pamphlets including 90 Minute Breads and Easy Bake Breads are available free of charge. Muesli Yogurt Bread 2 cups (500 mL) warm water (105 to 115 degrees F (40 to 45 C) 2 teaspoons (10 mL) granulated sugar 2 envelopes or 2 scant tablespoons (25 mL) active dry yeast 1 cup (175 mL) plain yogurt ½ cup (50 mL) vegetable oil ½ cup (50 mL) honey 2 teaspoons (10 mL) salt 4 to 4½ cups (1 to 1¼ L) all-purpose flour (approx.) 2 cups (500 mL) whole-wheat flour 1½ cups (375 mL) muesli. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle yeast into water; let stand for 10 minutes until dissolved (mixture should be foamy). Add yogurt, oil, honey and salt. Stir in three cups (750 mL) all-purpose flour and beat for two minutes with electric mixer or vigorously by hand. Add whole-wheat flour and muesli; combine well. Stir in enough of the remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft, but slightly sticky dough. Transfer to a floured board and knead, incorporating only enough flour to prevent the dough from sticking to board, until smooth and elastic, about eight to 10 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl and turn to coat on all sides. Cover with plastic wrap and a dry towel; let rise in a warm place (a cold oven with oven light turned on, or place bowl on a baking sheet set over a large bowl of hot water) until doubled, about one hour. Punch down dough, divide in two and shape into loaves. Place in two greased nine by five-inch (2 L) loaf pans. Lightly grease tops of loaves. Cover and let rise again until almost doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 C) oven for about 40 to 45 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. Remove from pans and cool on rack. Makes two loaves. Molasses Wheat Germ Bread with Walnuts 3 cups (750 mL) all-purpose flour (approx.) 3 cups (750 mL) whole-wheat flour ½ cup (125 mL) wheat germ 2 packages or 2 scant tablespoons (25 mL) quick-rise instant yeast 2 cups (500 mL) milk ½ cup (50 mL) butter ½ cup (75 mL) molasses 2 teaspoons (10 mL) salt 1 egg, lightly beaten 1 cup (250 mL) chopped walnuts Melted butter Additional wheat germ. Set aside one cup (250 mL) of the all-purpose flour. In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, wheat germ and yeast. In a saucepan, heat the milk with the butter, molasses and salt until butter melts. Let cool slightly; temperature should be 120 to 130 degrees F (50 to 55 C). Add liquid ingredients to the flour mixture. Stir in beaten egg; add enough of the remaining all-purpose flour to make a soft, slightly sticky dough. Turn out onto a floured board and knead dough until smooth and elastic, about eight minutes. Roll dough out into a rectangle and sprinkle with walnuts. Fold dough over and knead two to three times. Continue to work in remaining flour in the same way.

SUPPER Aksce power CONTINUED FROM PAGE 01 Fortunately, the dippers and spoons had long handles; the heat was so intense it spit-roasted the goose in three hours. The fire, a welcome sight as we arrived at the 1860-vintage Cook's Tavern during a snowstorm, posed other hazards. As teacher Carol Sargent put it, ""Oh, my aching back"" must have been a frequent complaint after a housewife had turned out a meal. And women often set themselves alight when cooking, she warned, as her full-length 19th-century costume brushed over some hot coals. The coals had been shovelled into a heap on the stone hearth so a cast iron ""bake kettle"" on legs could be set on top, an apple pie lowered inside, and more coals heaped on the lid. Apart from the goose, which had us all amazed because it cooked so quickly, browned to perfection and tasted so good, the cooking of the pie was the most surprising feat of the day. This task was assigned to Ottawa Sun food editor Sheridan Brace. Within 45 minutes her pie, filled with moistened dried apples, had baked as crisp and golden-brown as if it had come from a modern electric oven. Its only drawback: the handmade puff pastry was chewy. However, this didn't stop us from forking it up with gusto. Soup cook Cathy Thompson was first to finish her assignment, beef and barley soup which she served us in wide, china soup plates. Unknown to her, the fire was considerably hotter than the simmering temperature called for in the recipe from Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management. Thompson, a Morrisburg Leader reporter, produced her soup in two hours, one hour ahead of the time given in the recipe. After a morning at hearthside, we became somewhat deft at adjusting temperatures. It's all a matter of how far you keep your pot from the flames, we learned. And that turned out to depend on the number of heavy, iron hooks you link together to suspend a pot from a swinging iron crane in the chimney. This was an era of few commercial food products. ""You couldn't go to the store for most foods,"" said Sargent, a teacher who has directed hearthside cooking classes for both adults and children for the past seven years. Ingredients such as white flour could not be taken for granted. Whole-wheat flour would be used for most baking, white flour only for special-occasion dishes such as a party dessert. Vegetables you grew would be stored in a root cellar, fruit in a cold pantry and herbs, dried, hung from the rafters. Three ingredients in my dessert raisins, sherry and a lemon flavoring called ""essence"" would have been bought at a general store, she said. I learned to proceed cautiously when adding this early version of lemon extract to my recipe for ""A healthful pudding sauce"" from Miss Beecher's Domestic Receipt-Book, 1869. The flavoring looked innocent enough in its heavy glass jar. In centuries past, it would have been made whenever fresh lemons were available and stored. Menu from Upper Canada 1860 supper Barley Soup (Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861) Fried Oysters (Canadian Manual of Cookery, 1861) Roast Goose with Sage and Onion Stuffing (Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management) Seasonal Vegetables (Canadian Settler's Guide, 1855) Dried Apple Pie (Young Housekeeper's Friend, 1853) Baroness Pudding (Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management) A Healthful Pudding Sauce (Miss Beecher's Domestic Receipt-Book, 1869) Tea ESPOSITO PUBLIC MARKET 7030 ST MICHEL 722-1069 or 156. The pale yellow liquid turned out to pack a punch when blended with brown sugar, butter and sherry and simmered in a tiny iron pot over the fire. Still, it tasted perfect with slabs of my hot, steamed Baroness Pudding, moist with a diet-defying quantity of suet, or fat. One cooking method we were told to shun was the Victorian habit, as Sargent put it, of cooking vegetables ""right to a mush."" Varieties then were far different from our hybrid types, which require only a brief simmering or steaming. The second half of the 19th century saw the beginnings of kitchen gadgetry, Sargent said. Cornwall CBC broadcaster Valerie Marshall used an early metal apple corer in making her chunky apple sauce to go with the goose. Sargent showed us a ""clock Jack,"" a timer you wound with a key so it would turn a roast slowly over the fire as it unwound. Another version of this appliance was a ""roaster,"" operated by twisting yarn around a skewer. A hand-turned coffee grinder was easy to comprehend. A ""grid iron"" needed explanation. Its cast-iron grids were grooved to catch fat drippings and funnel them into a tray at one end. ""That fat would be used to make a pie crust or treat your iron pots,"" Sargent said. ""Never wash a cast-iron pot by submerging it in water,"" she warned. Pour a little water into the pot, scrub with a pot scrubber (we used a brush made of small twigs tied in a bunch), swish the water about vigorously, discard it and set the pot to dry, she told us. ""Otherwise your pot will rust. And you should treat it once a week with a little lard."" Sargent taught us respect for the cast-iron equipment. ""These pots get very hot and stay hot for a long time. It's one of the nice properties of cast iron,"" she said. ""Another lesson was the sparing use of ingredients. ""They didn't waste anything,"" said Sargent. As an example, she had Sandra Lee Johnston of the Iroquois, Ont., Chieftain set the giblets from the goose carefully aside before adding the sage-flavored bread-crumb stuffing. They would have been used to make a giblet pie for another meal. Soon after 1860, wood stoves came into wider use and cooking techniques became more elaborate and precise, Sargent told us. They started marketing it in late 1985, when they brought in Montreal businessman Peter Rona, who purchased the Canadian rights to the game. ""I thought I was finished,"" Rona said recently. ""I couldn't make a sale for a year and a half."" Bar and restaurant owners would ask: ""Who else has it?"" Nobody wants to be first. ""This is no get-rich-quick scheme. It's a very long haul."" But the system is off the ground, with 240 subscribers in the United States and 170 in Canada. And growing. NTN recently announced plans to expand into the home-viewer market, after a successful pilot project involving 16,000 homes in Dallas. Beginning in April, NTN will be offered through Bell Telephone's Alex videotext service. TACTICAL TEAM Experts to visit troubled hospital wards CONTINUED FROM PAGE A1 it's not a new idea. ""It has already been done 10 times,"" Douville said in a telephone interview from Montreal. Officials with the Quebec Hospitals Association said they would issue a statement later in the week. Cote said both investigating teams are to cooperate with hospital officials to improve conditions but if hospitals don't conform to their suggestions, he's ready to step in. He would not reveal who was on the teams except to say they are emergency specialists. ""There is only one tactical team, dubbed the department's own SWAT team, for now."" Statistics made public by the Health and Social Services Department yesterday show occupation rates for emergency beds dropped from 1985 to 1988, but have increased since then despite the continued cash injections. For example, the occupation rate for beds in Montreal increased from 91 per cent to 97 per cent during 1988. Yet Cote believes 80 per cent of emergency-room patients don't belong there and could be better treated in out-patient clinics, community health clinics, or private clinics. Those areas stand a better chance of getting more money, he said. Cote said he wants to create an emergency system in which funding needs are based on cold statistics and efficient management, not how well one region is able to lobby the government or how loud they scream. ""It's with an instrument like this that we'll be able to give each region and sub-region (the service) it has the right to,"" he said. The Parti Quebecois, meanwhile, said the Liberals were playing for time and using the investigating teams as a smoke screen instead of addressing the heart of the problem. Blame budget woes: hospitals JEFF HEINRICH THE GAZETTE Hospital officials and watchdogs yesterday blamed budget problems and school holidays not mismanagement for staff shortages this week that have closed 1,000 of 11,000 beds in the Montreal region. Only in rare cases has mismanagement led to shortages, said Marcel Marion, who regulates bed closings for the Montreal Regional Health and Social Services Council. Marion rejected Health Minister Marc-Yvan Cote's suggestion yesterday that poor management has led to chronic emergency-ward overcrowding, contending most hospitals have streamlined operations in recent years to become more efficient. Jacques Maynard, who heads the 300-bed Cite de la Sante Laval Hospital in Laval, said 60 people were brought in to emergency yesterday ""and we have a capacity for only 32."" Forty-five beds have been closed. ""We already have a very congested emergency ward, at the best of times; it's certain that at times like this it gets worse,"" Maynard said. The Laval hospital is one of the worst off of several Montreal-area hospitals suffering from bed shortages, Marion said. Also hard hit by the vacations (when many doctors and nurses take time off to be with their holidaying children) and a March 31 budget deadline are the Centre Hospitalier Fleury, the Centre Hospitalier St. Michel and Jean Talon Hospital, Marion said. He said some ""downtown anglophone hospitals"" have contributed to the bed shortage problem by tying up too many beds for elective surgery. He did not name the hospitals. ""There are some where elective surgery counts for 55 or 60 per cent of all beds, with the rest for emergency. It should be the reverse,"" he said. Administrators at the Montreal General, Jewish General and Royal Victoria hospitals were not available for comment last night.

MEECH Expect consequences if pact dies: PM CONTINUED FROM PAGE A1 rescue Quebec from ""the snowbank"" where it was abandoned when the other nine provinces and the federal government ratified the Constitution in 1982. ""It's pretty hard, you know, to have 7 million people, one of the founding peoples, standing on that snowbank and say, 'Isn't it wonderful, aren't things terrific?' Well, of course, they are not terrific."" Mulroney wasn't ready to speculate on what will happen if the accord is rejected. ""I do not accept the view that the Meech Lake accord can be set aside without consequences. There will be consequences. I'm not capable of telling you what they might be, but obviously there will be consequences."" In Winnipeg, about 50 prominent Manitobans who fear those consequences knocked a chunk out of the province's anti-Meech wall yesterday by urging the accord be passed for the good of Canada. ""We believe Quebecers are holding out the hand of friendship and we should welcome them fully and generously,"" said Patrick Riley, a Winnipeg lawyer and founder of Manitobans for Meech Lake. ""Ratifying the accord will be a severe blow to separatism in Quebec,"" he told reporters packed into a tiny hotel meeting room. He said the organization came together out of a feeling of urgency, with the June 23 ratification deadline fast approaching and Quebec rumbling about separation in the event the Meech Lake accord isn't passed. The group plans a campaign of newspaper ads and public meetings, starting this weekend with a conference in Winnipeg of like-minded organizations, such as the Montreal-based Friends of Meech Lake and Canadians for Unifying the Constitution. The association includes: Roland Penner, Manitoba's former New Democratic Party attorney general; Yvon Dumont, president of the Manitoba Metis Federation; Jack Fraser of Federal Industries Ltd.; and Art Mauro, president of Investors Group Inc. and chairman of the 1991 Winnipeg Grey Cup committee. But the group faces some formidable opposition, with all three parties in the Manitoba legislature demanding changes to Meech Lake before they will ratify the agreement. Conservative Premier Gary Filmon wasn't impressed by the new organization. ""What they are doing and saying is an insult to all of those people throughout the province who have legitimate concerns,"" Filmon said. Manitoba and New Brunswick are the only provinces that haven't approved the accord; Newfoundland has threatened to rescind its ratification if amendments aren't made. The accord recognizes Quebec as a distinct society, allows all provinces to opt out of some federal spending programs and requires unanimous consent for Senate reform and creating new provinces.

And he said he expects Canadians will warm to the 1987 agreement once they consider the alternatives. Speaking to reporters at the start of a three-day Quebec tour, Mulroney said he finds nothing ominous or threatening in the Quebec Liberal Party's decision to set up a committee to examine options if the constitutional accord isn't ratified by the June 23 deadline. ""What I understood was the Liberal Party in Quebec, a strongly federalist party, examining its alternatives in the event that Meech Lake was unsuccessful,"" he said. ""You would have to be reaching a great deal to read anything more than reasonable self-examination."" Mulroney said he still believes the deal can be saved. He said the federal government isn't ready to talk about life after Meech. However, Mulroney said it isn't surprising that Premier Robert Bourassa and others in Quebec are having doubts. ""I thought that he (Bourassa) was seeking, in a very rational and thoughtful way, to examine certain options that may or may not emerge,"" Mulroney said. ""I didn't think that he was threatening and I didn't think he was sabre-rattling,"" Mulroney said. The prime minister said, ""The best alternative for Quebec is to be found in a united Canada."" But he said if Quebecers see the Constitution as a source of division rather than unity, they may feel like ""pretty reluctant participants in the federation.""

Whisky puts 5-year-old in coma REUTER DALLAS A 5-year-old boy who was given a third of a litre of whisky and told to ""drink it like a man"" was in a coma yesterday and reported to be suffering from irreversible brain damage. Raymond Griffin had a blood-alcohol level of 0.55 when admitted to a children's hospital suffering from convulsions. A level of 0.40 is considered lethal. Police said a 21-year-old man who was a guest at a party given by the boy's mother first gave the child a few sips of beer, then sips from a glass of bourbon laced with brandy. Then the guest ""gave the boy a glassful of whisky and told him to drink it like a man,"" police said. The boy emptied the 300-millilitre glass equivalent to almost seven regular drinks. ""The child just drank it straight down, probably in two swallows,"" said police Sgt. Mark Bigler. ""I couldn't drink it like that."" Police arrested the guest, Anthony Jimerson of Fort Worth, and charged him with injury to a child. They said Jimerson wanted the child to fall asleep so that he could be alone with the boy's mother. Jimerson was being held at Fort Worth County jail. Dog saves young master from freezing BOSTON GLOBE RAYNHAM, Mass. His legs and feet felt frozen. His clothes were sopping from the murky swamp he had stumbled into. Lost and confused, he lay in the snow for hours on a bitterly cold night. Yet Greg Holzworth, 12, refused to believe he might freeze to death in the woods. When the gnawing fear and minus-12 C temperature began to stifle him, he huddled under his dog, Shadow, for warmth. ""I was scared and I was wicked cold, but I wasn't thinking about panicking,"" said Greg. ""I just laid there and called the dog over and he lay next to me and then he got up and laid on top of me. He kept me warm."" Police say the Raynham boy was likely saved by his 9-year-old black Labrador retriever, who lay across his master's lap to keep him warm after the youth lost his way in dense, swampy woods behind his house on Sunday afternoon. Nearly nine hours later, during a search with more than 100 police officers, firefighters, family members and rescue volunteers, Greg and Shadow were found cold and wet but alive and well a kilometre from home. Greg was checked over and treated for exposure Monday at a Taunton, Mass., hospital. AND REMEMBER, AT SEARS THERE'S NO DOWN PAYMENT ON APPROVED CREDIT.

THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1990 B3 Don't bet that Bourassa is simply bluffing on Meech lake. Is Robert Bourassa engaging in sabre-rattling over Meech Lake, as Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon says he is? Of course he is. There's no doubt that Bourassa intended to put pressure on Filmon and the other Meech Lake holdouts by having his party, at the meeting of its general council in Quebec City on the weekend, formally create a committee at this point to prepare ""alternative scenarios"" for the party's policy convention next February if the constitutional accord fails. A party that is capable of changing its language policy in an afternoon, as the Liberals did at a special meeting of their general council after the Supreme Court decision on the language of commercial signs came down in December 1988, shouldn't need a whole year to come up with a new constitutional option. It could have at least waited until after the fate of the accord is sealed, which the government's Meech watchers say will be in only another month or six weeks at the most, to begin the process formally. In fact, a committee like the one that the Liberals made such a show of creating last weekend has already existed informally since December, laying the groundwork for a review of the party's constitutional position on the instructions of the party executive. But it's precisely because the Meech watchers believe the accord can still be saved, but that time is running out on it, that the committee was formally created at this crucial point. The need for ""alternative scenarios"" wasn't apparent when the Bourassa government initiated the round of informal talks that resulted in the Meech Lake accord in June 1987. Back then, Bourassa and his minister of Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Gil Remillard, said that if it looked as though their proposals would not be accepted, Quebec would simply walk away from the negotiating table and wait for the rest of Canada to come around. In the meantime, it would continue to stay away from constitutional talks on other subjects, such as aboriginal rights, as it had already been doing since the rest of Canada had imposed a new constitution on it in 1981. It might seem illogical that, now that Quebec's proposals have been formally ratified by Parliament and the legislatures of eight of the 10 provinces, the Liberals apparently feel that boycotting future constitutional negotiations might no longer be adequate should the proposals be rejected by two or three provinces representing no more than 10 per cent of the country's population. But that escalation reflects the buildup in political tension in this province in response to what Quebecers see as an anti-Quebec and anti-French backlash in the rest of the country expressed as opposition to Meech Lake and bilingualism. When you boil off all the essentially meaningless though headline-grabbing rhetoric about ""not practising federalism on bended knee"" and vague musings about undefined ""supranational institutions"" that sound something like sovereignty-association, neither Bourassa nor Remillard has yet explicitly committed Quebec to anything beyond their original position. They've been quite content to encourage the media and for a while last Friday, until a gag order was apparently clamped on them other members of the Liberal cabinet and caucus to do their threatening for them. But it will not be Revenue Minister Yves Seguin who decides whether the Bourassa government comes out for Quebec sovereignty. That will be Bourassa's decision alone, and he will probably reach it the way he decided on his response to the Supreme Court's ruling on the language of commercial signs keeping open as many options as possible until the last moment, then doing what the results of Sorccom's public opinion surveys tell him to do. And that will probably not be until at least August, at the annual meeting of the Liberal Party's youth wing. Bourassa may try to manipulate public opinion by floating trial balloons to see how people react to them. But he doesn't try to lead it. Rather, he is led by it, responding to its shifts like a surfer constantly adjusting his position in a wave to try to find the best ride. That's what makes his response to the failure of Meech Lake unpredictable: because it is too early to predict how Quebecers themselves will react, and how intense that reaction will be. But are all the threats coming out of Quebec mere bluff? If Gary Filmon and the other Meech holdouts want to bet that they are, the stakes are nothing less than Canada. Clouds darken early hope of Open Sides Soviets start to show signs of cold feet CHRISTOPHER YOUNG SOUTHAM NEWS OTTAWA The Cold War must be over when senior officials start getting headaches from problems of peace. It isn't going to be easy, as we know from reading about the pell-mell drive toward unification of the two Germanys, or about several hundred thousand protesters jamming the Garden Ring Road in central Moscow. Viktor Karpov, chief Soviet disarmament negotiator, did a little moaning here Monday about peace problems. Take excess tanks. Talk about piles of burning tires, or mountains of last year's phone books: How do you get rid of 40,000 tanks that you've agreed to withdraw from Eastern Europe? Drive them home, but then what? The huge tank force in Eastern Europe was Moscow's answer to the overwhelming American superiority in bombers and missiles in Cold War days. ""The mentality was that if we were attacked we could occupy France or Germany,"" Karpov said, lifting a corner of the secrecy blanket that would have muffled any such remark in the past. ""We had 60,000 tanks,"" he added, telling a small round-table audience not to ask him why, because he had no idea. Now negotiations are virtually complete for the Soviet Union and the United States to slim the columns of tanks based in Western and Eastern Europe to a mere 20,000 each. Someone asked Karpov what his country was going to do with the 40,000 surplus tanks, seeking assurance that they wouldn't be sold to warring Third World countries. The question reminded Karpov of a story, a true one but so Russian that if it weren't about tanks it might have come from a 19th-century Russian novel. ""These tanks are a problem,"" he said. There are ""some very ingenious people"" in the new cooperatives, which are intended to rouse the sleeping spirit of business enterprise without the exploitation of man by man that Communist theory condemns. ""We discovered a while ago some tanks on the way to Novorossiysk, a port on the Black Sea. No one knew why. Investigation revealed that a tank factory had exceeded its plan in numbers of tanks produced. It sold the extras to a co-op, which intended to resell them abroad. ""These people are being prosecuted,"" said Karpov with a sigh, ""and that's not the way to deal with 40,000 tanks."" The right way to deal with them is still being sought. Experts say it's not practical to reprocess the heavy steel they are made of. The idea of removing their gun turrets and turning them into heavy vehicles for civilian use was abandoned because their giant tracks did so much damage. That was all very well for occupying France, but why rip up your own marginally passable roads? Karpov and ambassadors from other NATO and Warsaw Pact countries were packing their bags yesterday as the Ottawa phase of the 23-nation Open Skies conference ended in a mood much less buoyant than when it opened two weeks ago. Then, there was jubilant talk of historic opportunities, as the nations seemed anxious to negotiate a treaty giving each other open sesame to fly across the territories of former foes counting troops and tanks, air bases and missile silos as part of the Vienna security conference's efforts to build confidence and press forward the process of disarmament in Europe. But Karpov played spoiler at the end, refusing Western nations the right to fly their own planes and use their own cameras and sensor equipment, apparently fearful that Soviet technology could not match the stuff from Silicon Valley.",1,19900228,modern,cold,0,0,0,0,0,0,

disappointing snails in pastry; outstanding boneless rabbit with mustard sauce, accompanied by fresh fettuccine in basil sauce; and a so-so sirloin steak with french-fries, Salads were great, while desserts were limited, Open daily from noon to 3 p.m. (brunch on Sun);

Also seen during the count week was a Carolina wren, Hudson, salient observation, but it's nonetheless telling: ""Last year (1988) we stayed with the 1988 catalogue, and business remained excellent"", ""I find it (the 1990 catalogue) a closer reflection of actual selling price, but collectors are accustomed to discounting from the catalogue value and they'll have a hard time adjusting to full catalogue"", How about this?

Default,350,"H8 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 29, 2000 TRAVEL Winter visitors get space at Yellowstone EDWARD PARSONS Edmonton Journal YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Mont - For many years, my desire to explore this magnificent but wildly popular park had been tempered by my general dislike of large crowds. Much to my delight, however, I learned that 96 per cent of visitors to the park come between the May long weekend and Labour Day. That leaves the other 4 per cent of us to explore the park in relative peace the rest of the year. Yellowstone's relatively high elevation ensures it receives copious amounts of snow in the winter. Accumulations of 13 to 16 metres are not uncommon, causing forests of tall spruce trees to poke out of the snow banks and appear as nothing more than tracts of Christmas trees. Not surprisingly, the snowmobile replaces the car as the chief means of transportation for many local residents. The road system of Yellowstone National Park is not plowed in the winter; therefore, travelers have to base their exploration out of West Yellowstone, Mont, Jackson Hole, Wyo, or Mammoth Hot Springs inside the park boundary. These serve as year-round centres for park adventure. My travels brought me to West Yellowstone in the early part of March. The first thing that strikes you is the odd traffic patterns. It was a novelty to pull up to one of the town's only street lights behind one truck and five snowmobiles, all patiently waiting for the light to change. One local resident told me he had only started his truck five or six times that winter, and only when he had to travel out of town. ""Why would I want to when I can do everything I want with this?"" With that, he picked his grocery bags out of the rack on the back of his Ski-Doo and headed inside. Animals have the right-of-way along Yellowstone's inner ring road. The sole purpose of West Yellowstone seems to be to provide for the needs of the park visitor. Securing lodging and a snowmobile proved quick and easy. Most of the major hotels and motels have package deals with local snowmobile outfitters. Winter also brings off-season rates to the local hotels. Two nights in the newest hotel in town, the luxurious Grey Wolf Inn, and a snowmobile for two days for $249 US. The Grey Wolf costs more than $250 a night during the summer. Also included in the package was a snowsuit, helmet and, if required, boots. With all the logistics out of the way and the complimentary early morning breakfast under my belt, I hauled my camera gear out to my waiting sled. The machines were brand new and started easier than my car did. There were people on hand to get everyone accustomed to their machines. After a brief stop at the park office to pick up my park pass, I was off on the wide-open trails. The snowmobile trails follow the summer roads and were well-groomed and smoother than a lot of Canadian highways. It is mandatory that the machines remain on the roads to protect the wildlife from the riders and the riders from the hidden thermal areas that dot the park. The first 30 kilometres into the main junction of the park revealed a multitude of wildlife, including bison, elk, deer, coyotes, wolves and foxes - all within easy viewing distance of the road and some walking on the road itself. The main road system forms a large loop through the park, one that stretches more than 200 kilometres and encompasses some unique and stunning spectacles. Yellowstone's strange geologic features are merely the outward manifestations of one of the largest volcanoes in the world. In fact, most of the park is located inside the caldera formed during previous eruptions of a size unknown in historic times. Yellowstone still sits above a huge mass of magma. This is the heat source that fuels Yellowstone's most recognizable features, its geysers, the most famous of which is Old Faithful - possibly the most identifiable feature in any park in North America, Old Faithful has never failed to make its predicted appearance. The geyser, which is surrounded by a boardwalk and visitors' centre, erupts every 70 to 90 minutes, day in and day out. Its eruptions are even more spectacular in winter when the super-heated water hits the frigid air. Although Old Faithful is the most recognized geyser, it is by no means the only one. The trip from the main junction to the Old Faithful lodge takes you past dozens of geysers, mud pots and deep pools of iridescent blue water. Most areas that are open in the summer are maintained in the winter, so you can interrupt your riding to wander through collections of geysers and pools. Animals often congregate around the hot pools and steam vents for warmth. Despite the sub-zero temperatures, open water abounds as the volume of heated water keeps even the large rivers ice-free. Geese spend the winter wading in the heated pools that are perpetually shrouded in steam. In the northern regions of the park is one of the lesser-known spectacular sights - the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Although not quite as deep as its more famous namesake in Arizona, it is nonetheless a breathtaking sight. Best of all, with the light winter traffic, you often find yourself alone at sights that have thousands of visitors in summer. If you manage to complete a tour of the park and still wish to put some miles on your machine before calling it a day, the surrounding area has hundreds of snowmobile trails, enough to satisfy even the most die-hard rider. As the day draws to a close and you return to town, head back to the hotel for a swim in the pool or a soak in the hot tub to get rid of any soreness from a day of riding. A new day on the trails awaits you the next day. IF YOU GO Staying there: West Yellowstone, Mammoth Hot Springs and Jackson Hole are year-round centres. The Old Faithful Lodge is open year-round and offers snowcoach transportation into the park. For general reservations, phone (888) 255-7710. West Yellowstone's year-round population is only 900, but it has 25 lodges. Summer pricing is expensive, but there are reasonable winter package deals, including snowmobiles. Gear: Be sure to keep winter gear in your car as mountain travel can be dangerous and weather changes rapidly. Weather: Temperatures can range from above freezing to the minus-30s. Layer clothes beneath a snowsuit to make the coldest temperatures comfortable. Information: Montana, (800) 847-4868; Wyoming, (800) 225-5996.

What do they mean they've been working too hard?"" A south-central resident and business consultant Jerry Remillard said he's baffled by the city's weekend break in snow removal. ""It fits exactly with its strategy which is totally erratic,"" Remillard said. ""We're governed by budgets and not by common sense."" Residents leave their cars on the street because the city doesn’t respect its own signs, Remillard said. ""You have to guess when they're going to remove the snow,"" said Remillard, who successfully fought parking tickets last year by showing a municipal court judge several photographs of his car, piles of snow, and a copy of The Gazette showing the date - three consecutive days after snow removal signs went up.

Two prisoners at large after grabbing van INGRID PHANEUF The Gazette Two of three prisoners who commandeered a prison vehicle while on a community-service outing from a Laval minimum-security prison Thursday are still on the loose. Inmates Eric Raymond, 25, and Normand Beauchemin, 36, along with Rheal Ayotte, 38, and a volunteer escort had arrived back at the Federal Training Centre prison in the St. Vincent de Paul district of Laval after an uneventful day of maintenance work at a children's summer camp in Chertsey, in the Lanaudière region. But when the volunteer, who was also the driver, stepped out of the vehicle, one of the inmates took the wheel and drove away. Prison officials do not yet know which of the inmates engineered the escape. The vehicle - a blue 1997 Dodge Caravan - was recovered yesterday morning in a restaurant parking lot on Levesque Blvd, two kilometres from the prison. One of the escapers turned himself in. Ayotte, who was serving four years for armed robbery, returned to the prison yesterday afternoon. He was to have been released in November 2001. Raymond and Beauchemin were to get out of jail in August. Eric Raymond, a first-time convict, was serving a two-year, eight-month sentence for breaking and entering and theft. Raymond is white, stands 5 feet 7 inches and weighs about 158 pounds. He has brown hair and hazel eyes. Beauchemin is white, stands about 5 feet 4 inches, and weighs about 180 pounds. He has brown hair and brown eyes. Beauchemin had 6 months to go. Raymond: first-time prisoner. Flames kill woman Heroic firefighters ignore danger, scale ladder to rescue 2 others from inferno in the Plateau BASEM BOSHRA The Gazette A fire that claimed the life of a 60-year-old disabled woman in the Plateau Mont Royal district last night could have been even more tragic if not for the quick thinking of a pair of veteran firefighters. Around 6 p.m., firefighters were called to a two-storey residential building on Hotel de Ville Ave, just north of Pine Ave, that was engulfed in flames and billowing smoke, Montreal fire department chief of operations Gilles Courtemanche said. Yannick Ferland and Dominic Prud'homme were among the first firefighters from nearby Station 16 to reach the building. ""Through the smoke, we could hear screaming from the second floor,"" Prud'homme said. ""We looked up and saw there was a woman on the second-floor balcony. She was screaming for help."" The door leading into the building - the only way to get to the second floor - was blocked by the flames, so firefighters needed to find an alternative route to the woman. Noticing another balcony right next to the one on which the woman was trapped, Ferland and Prud'homme scaled a ladder to it and then jumped the short distance across. ""She kept yelling, but it was in Spanish and she didn't understand French or English,"" Ferland said. Fortunately, the woman managed to point out that her husband was still trapped inside their apartment. The firefighters picked the man up and managed to carry him and the woman down to waiting ambulances. The elderly couple were taken to a hospital where they were treated for smoke inhalation and shock. But when firefighters made their way through the flames to the ground-floor apartment, they found the body of the 60-year-old woman on her bed, charred beyond recognition. Courtemanche said neighbours told them the woman was wheelchair-bound and had recently arrived from Toronto. Police were trying to track down her relatives last night. It took about 100 firefighters about 90 minutes to extinguish the four-alarm blaze, which investigators believe started in the elderly woman's apartment. About 20 people were forced from the building and two others adjacent to it. The fire caused about $200,000 worth of damage, Courtemanche estimated. Some of those people will be forced to find new homes. Faces dripping with sweat despite the freezing temperatures last night, Ferland, an 8-year veteran of the fire department, and Prud'homme, who's been fighting fires for 10 years, were sombre in recounting their heroics. They said it was tough to shake the image of the dead woman. ""That's just the way it is,"" Prud'homme said. ""Even if you've done everything you can and even if you've saved some lives, you still think about the person who died. It's always a tragedy."" The police arson squad was investigating the cause of the blaze last night, Montreal Urban Community Police Constable Caroline Courteau said, standard practice during a fatal fire.

Expect rollicking good fun as Health Ministers Allan Rock and Pauline Marois face off in the annual hospital-bed race. There had been fears this event would be canceled owing to a shortage of medical equipment and too many darn sick people. However, these proved to be unfounded after Rock sent patients home early with a Tamiflu inhaler and the promise they'll see a doctor one of these days - definitely before the next Liberal leadership convention! If Rock wins, expect Marois to file an official protest at this vicious power grab. Bonus points for nice hair: (Marois was originally scheduled to take part in the celebrity tan-a-thon in the Mexican tent, but denies she pulled out after learning there was no silent flush, only Port-o-lets.) Hockey. A surprise entry after Canadian players who had moved to the States came back after discovering there are no Zambonis or snowplows south of the Mason-Dixon line.

Patience is supposed to be a virtue, but we're too busy for that. Waiting is an insult to us, one expert says. We sense that we've been disrespected; hence the anger. THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 29, 2000 PETER CARLSON Washington Post WASHINGTON - The music is driving you nuts. It's so cheerful, it's depressing. It's so bland, it's offensive. Suddenly it stops, and you get excited: could this be an actual human? No, it's just that upbeat On-Hold Man again. ""Thank you for continuing to hold,"" he says. ""While we do have an unusually high call volume at this time, we value your call. Please hold for the next available associate."" You've heard this message so many times, you've memorized it. You hate On-Hold Man. You want to strangle him. You're getting surly. You've been waiting for the repairman all day. The company promised he'd be here between 9 and 12, and now it's almost 3, and you've called to find out what happened. But before you could even ask the question, they put you on hold. Now that music is back again. It's supposed to be soothing, but you're not soothed. You're seething. ""Thank you for continuing to hold. While we do have an unusually high call volume at this time, we value your call - then answer it,"" you scream. "" - hold for the next available associate."" You curse. You rage. But what's the use? You sigh and settle into the quiet desperation of waiting. Foolishly, you begin to contemplate how much of your life has been spent waiting. Waiting at the post office, where the clerks seem to move in slow motion. Or at the supermarket, where everybody in the 10-items-or-less line is shooting death-ray glances at the guy with 12 items. Or waiting at McDonald's, where you always choose the slowest line, the one behind the people who freeze when confronted with the question ""Do you want fries with that?"" Or waiting for elevators that seem to have gone AWOL while you jab idiotically at the already-illuminated button, knowing it won't do any good. ""Thank you for continuing to hold."" ""Waiting is an insult to us,"" says anthropologist David Murray. ""We feel we're being put down when we're forced to wait. We sense that we've been disrespected; hence, the anger."" We are a busy people. We have day planners and lists of Things to Do Today. We're highly caffeinated, and we expect life to be full of action, bing, bang, boom. We see waiting as time taken from life, Murray says, while other cultures see it as a part of life. ""We feel we are living only during an event - the rest of the time we're hibernating,"" he says. ""It's a particularly American or Western attitude. In nonindustrial tribal societies, the rhythms are slower and waiting is part of life. In the absence of clocks and hard-and-fast punctual expectations, it's hard to be frustrated by waiting."" Several years ago, Polish journalist Ryszard Kapuscinski was stuck in a Siberian airport for four days, waiting out a blizzard, bored out of his skull. ""It is a dreadful sort of idleness, an unbearable tedium to sit motionless like this,"" he wrote. ""But on the other hand, don't millions and millions of people the world over pass the time in just such a passive way? And haven't they done so for years, for centuries?"" Kapuscinski recalled the countless scenes of waiting he'd witnessed during three decades of covering the Third World: ""Everywhere, everywhere the same sight - people sitting motionless for hours on end, on old chairs, on bits of plank, on plastic crates, in the shade of poplars and mango trees, leaning against the walls of slums, against fences and window frames, irrespective of the time of day or of the season, of whether the sun is shining or the rain is falling, phlegmatic and expressionless people, as if in a state of chronic drowsiness, not really doing anything."" You recall a statistic reprinted everywhere a few years back, attributed to a Pittsburgh research firm called Priority Management: Americans spend five years of their lives waiting in lines. For a 75-year-long life, it comes out to more than 1.5 hours a day. Can that possibly be true? There are other statistics: on an average day, according to a book called On an Average Day by Tom Heymann, Americans spend 101,369,863 hours waiting in line. That's 37 billion hours a year. And that's just waiting in line. But waiting is a many-splendoured thing. Waiting for the weekend. Waiting for the Messiah. Waiting for the waiter. Waiting for your ship to come in. Waiting for takeoff. Waiting with bated breath. Waiting for a phone call. There's the intense waiting of childhood. Waiting for Christmas morning. Waiting for the last day of school. Waiting through endless car trips: are we there yet? Waiting to grow whiskers. Waiting to grow breasts. Waiting to grow up. There's the bittersweet waiting of romance and procreation. Waiting for her to notice you. Waiting for him to ask you out. Waiting for her to get ready. Waiting for him to pop the question. Waiting for your period. Waiting for the results of your pregnancy test. Waiting through your ninth month of pregnancy, which seems as long as the previous eight combined. Some waiting is more painful. Waiting for the jury to reach a verdict. Waiting for biopsy results. Waiting in refugee camps. Waiting in prison. Waiting for your teenager, and it's 2 in the morning, and she hasn't called. We have an unusually high call volume at this time. The poor wait more than the rich. They wait in soup lines and welfare lines and unemployment lines. They wait in emergency rooms and free medical clinics. They cannot pay with money, so they pay with time - little chunks of their lives. The poor wait for buses and subways while the rich zoom past in cars or glide by in limousines driven by chauffeurs who are waiting and ready to open the door when their bosses appear. Once, Louis XIV stepped out of his palace to find his royal driver just arriving in the royal coach. The king was unhappy. ""I almost had to wait,"" he grumbled. ""If you have enough money, you can buy someone else's time,"" says psychologist Robert Levine. ""You can pay people to run your errands. Your time is worth more than their time."" In his book A Geography of Time, Levine codified what he calls ""The Rules of the Waiting Game."" One rule was, Status dictates who waits: the higher your rank, the more people you can keep waiting - and the longer you can keep them waiting. When the company president wants to see you, you hustle to his office. Then he keeps you waiting, watching his secretary make phone calls for him. He's too important to wait for someone to answer. So she gets them on the phone and says, ""Please hold for Mr. Smith."" It's nothing personal, just a reminder of who's boss. And it's nothing new. In the Middle Ages, Pope Gregory VII is said to have forced Henry IV, the Holy Roman emperor who had challenged his authority, to stand barefoot in the snow for three days before meeting with him. In 1949, Joseph Stalin kept Mao Zedong waiting for 17 days in a dacha in the freezing Russian winter. Mao had just taken over China, but Stalin was showing him who was boss in the Communist world. But you don't have to be a pope or a dictator to play the game. Clerks enjoy this, too, when they make you wait in line and then suddenly hang up a sign that says ""Closed"" and amble off. ""Making a person wait is an exercise in power,"" Levine says. ""There is no greater symbol of domination, since time is the only possession which can in no sense be replaced."" We value your call. Now on-hold music is back again. It's so nondescript you can't tell if it's the same song or a new one. Why don't they play some rock 'n' roll? Because it didn't test well with focus groups. James Kellaris, associate professor of marketing at the University of Cincinnati, was hired by a company to determine what kind of music makes time pass quickly for people stuck on hold. ""They can't really control the waiting time, so they use all kinds of strategies to distract people,"" Kellaris says. ""They hoped I could engineer some music that would shrink perceived time in relation to clock time."" Perceived time is how long people think they spent on hold. Clock time is how long they actually spent on hold. Perceived time is inevitably longer than clock time, Kellaris says. His focus groups in Indianapolis and Los Angeles listened to various kinds of music, then guessed how long they'd been listening. Rock 'n' roll was the worst. ""The music was so familiar that hearing a segment of a song inferred the entire song and maybe the entire repertoire of the artist,"" he says, ""so it had the effect of expanding perceived time."" Kellaris found that men and women had different responses. For men, classical music reduced the perceived time on hold. For women, light jazz reduced it. Which didn't help much. ""They could have set up a tape that said, 'If you're female, press 1. If you're male, press 2,' "" he says, ""but that seemed too controversial."" The biggest controversy is whether one long serpentine line or many short lines is better. This is serious for businesses: should you line people up in one long line, like they do at most banks? Or in many short lines, like they do in supermarkets? Single lines look longer, which can scare customers away. But multiple lines can frustrate customers who watch as people who arrived after them get served before them. ""When somebody slips by you, your psychological cost is high,"" says MIT professor Richard Larson, who has created computer systems to help airlines, banks and department stores deal with their line problems. ""You're going to remember that. And maybe next time you'll go to a place with a long serpentine line."" But Ziv Carmon, a professor of consumer psychology at Duke University, says some businesses - fast-food restaurants with nearby competitors, for instance - should use multiple lines because they look shorter. Please hold for the next available associate. We keep creating products to eliminate delay, but we're still bedeviled by waiting. ""As our pace of life gets more hectic, our tolerance for waiting in line goes down,"" Larson says. ""Obviously, we've got a problem."" We got tired of waiting in restaurants, so we invented fast-food joints. We got too impatient to wait for conventional ovens to cook our meals, so we invented microwave ovens to cook them faster. Now we grumble about the lines in fast-food restaurants. We stand in front of our microwave wondering why it's so slow. We grouse about how long it takes the computer to boot up. Every time-saving device allows us to put more on our schedule, which makes us more obsessed with time and less tolerant of waiting. Hello. Can I help you? Hello. You're startled. Somebody has answered your call. An actual human is talking to you. You stammer out your problem: when is the repairman coming? Oh, you want the customer service department, she says. This is the customer relations department. I'll transfer you. No, you say. Stop. Wait! But it's too late. The phone is ringing. Thank you for calling the customer service department. All our lines are busy now, but your call will be answered in the order in which it was received. Please hold for the next available associate. Bayer fined for misleading ads Associated Press WASHINGTON - Think taking aspirin can prevent a heart attack? It can reduce some risk - but not for everybody. The distinction is costing Bayer Corp. $1 million, the tab for a consumer education program announced this month to settle government charges that Bayer's advertising oversold aspirin's benefits. ""Aspirin is not appropriate for everyone, so be sure to talk to your doctor before you begin an aspirin regimen,"" say the full-page ads Bayer must run in four national magazines between February and May. Bayer also will distribute free consumer brochures titled Aspirin Regimen Therapy: Is it right for you? The settlement aims to clear up confusion about who can truly benefit from taking aspirin daily. SATURDAY, JANUARY 29, 2000 1 p.m. Kerr Financial Corp.

Don't miss The Gazette's SPECIAL RRSP FEATURE in the expanded Monday Business section. They fall into water they release that air in bubbles, explained Andrea Prosperetti, an engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and a co-author of the study. The water's surface tension holds down the bubbles, which vibrate in their efforts to escape, producing the screechy sound. The noise is in the range of 50 to 200 kilohertz, too high for human hearing, which maxes out at about 20 kHz, but audible to many species of aquatic wildlife. Prosperetti - still digging out from this week's East Coast blizzard - isn't disturbed by the idea of noisy snow. ""I find it very poetic,"" he said. Deep South learns about deep drifts Associated Press ATLANTA - A storm spread still more snow across the Deep South yesterday, giving children from Arkansas to Georgia a rare chance to build snowmen but threatening travel to the Super Bowl. The storm moved into the area after dumping up to 40 centimetres of snow in Oklahoma. Between 3 and 30 centimetres fell in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee before the storm stalled near the Alabama-Georgia line. Atlanta had warmed above freezing by yesterday afternoon, but the storm was expected to re-form and head east, hitting the area last night and through Super Bowl Sunday with up to 7 centimetres of snow. As a precaution, Delta Airlines canceled some flights into Atlanta yesterday afternoon, but promised to accommodate passengers trying to get to the Super Bowl. More than 100,000 people are expected in Atlanta for the game between the Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams. While travelers worried, thousands of children in the Deep South enjoyed a rare snow day. They threw snowballs and built snowmen as their parents took Friday off from work. In Alabama, TV stations stayed on the air all night giving live updates from cold reporters. Mississippi Governor Ronnie Musgrove activated about 300 National Guardsmen to help communities. In North Carolina, which was surprised by 60 centimetres of snow this week, Governor Jim Hunt asked President Bill Clinton to declare 26 counties disaster areas, which would make them eligible for federal funds. LITTLE SLEEP Much of the time drivers grab their average three-hours-a-night sleep while camped in the snow or dozing on the back of the sled as the dogs run on. Dawson, the race's midway point, is one place where they can be sure of a hot meal and a warm bed, since every driver and team is required to spend at least 36 hours in town. Last year, Ramy Brooks, from Healy, Alaska, was the first musher into Dawson. Even though it was just before midnight when he rounded the bend in the Yukon River, nearly 100 warmly bundled people lined Front St. to cheer him. On the race board in the lobby of the Downtown Hotel, his arrival time was noted (22:57) along with the number of dogs still in harness (10) and his running time from the last checkpoint.

Single $85, double $93. Dawson in the 1999 Yukon Quest Dog Race. Hard-running husky takes a much-deserved rest. The board showed the rest of the field spread out behind Brooks: his nearest rival wouldn't reach Dawson for another three hours; the last musher in, Dawson City native Peter Ledwidge, wouldn't arrive until late Sunday morning. But by Saturday night, nearly two dozen drivers, plus their dog-handlers, veterinarians, various hangers-on and a media contingent that included correspondents for CBC Radio, the National Post and America's National Public Radio were kicking up their heels in Dawson. Diamond Tooth Gertie's bar was full to contend with bears, and the town's three year-round bars were suddenly full. For good measure, a hockey tournament and a bonspiel were on at the same time, adding to the carnival atmosphere, but the real excitement came from the presence of the mushers. All towns in the Far North have their characters, and Dawson, which is still a gold-mining town, has more than its share, but when the Quest mushers arrive the character quotient leaps upward. It takes a rare breed, after all, to run this race. It's freezing, lonely and grueling. Downtown Hotel, 2nd Ave. and Queen St., Box 780, Dawson City, Yukon YOB 1G0.

In the Downtown Hotel dining room, for example, one musher discussed the patches of open water he'd had to steer his dogs carefully around on a stretch of frozen river. The other musher didn't know what he was talking about - he'd been catnapping on the back of his sled through that section - his dogs had avoided the black water on their own. There's also the occasional non-hibernating grizzly bear to deal with. Even when it's not outright scary, the Quest is still physically grueling and mentally exhausting: among the hallucinations reported by mushers in 1999 were visions of phantom mushers and dogs turning into vaginas - and those were the ones racers would discuss. In Dawson, after tending to their teams and having a sleep and a shower, many drivers show up at the Downtown Hotel or the Eldorado for a meal and a beer with friends and well-wishers. Last year's cast included Whitehorse's legendary Frank Turner, the only musher to have competed in all 16 Quests; German racer Petra Noelle, who was followed by a television crew from her homeland; crowd favourite Aily Zirkle (one of three women running in the 2000 Quest) and Jimmy Hendrick. There's no such thing as a typical Quest contestant, but Hendrick, 49, has several of the more common characteristics, including a singular lifestyle. Most of the year, he leads white-water river expeditions from his home in Alaska's Denali National Park. He got into the Quest in 1991 thinking ""it was just going to be another fun thing."" Then he did it ""and it wasn't fun. It was hard and painful and incredibly challenging. It kicked my butt."" Well, you simply don't live in the Far North and let things kick your butt, so Hendrick will be back in 2000 for his eighth try at winning the Quest. As you know, Les Boys played there on Monday, but didn't get home until Thursday night, while waiting out a record snowstorm. A Canadiens-Bruins game, which was to be played in Boston, had to be postponed. Stuff happens. Nobody died. What I must tell you now is that I'm still wondering why the National Hockey League people insisted that the game be played until the very last avenue of getting to Boston went down the drain. OK, so you don't postpone a game unless a state of emergency is in effect, which was the case for the Phoenix-Carolina game. And yes, there was a tiny chance that the Canadiens could fly out of Raleigh at noon, or a little later, for their date with the Bruins Thursday night. The NHL's stance always has been that if you can fly, you can play. No exceptions. This was a special case in that the Canadiens would have had to go into the game without skating for three days. They also would have had to play with equipment that had been locked in a freezing cargo hold all that time. The fact is, you had to be with this bunch to understand how hard its management team worked, how many telephone calls were made by director of team services Michele Lapointe (give this lady a raise, Monsieur Boivin) in an attempt to get the team on the road to Boston. They did everything possible to get there, but time ran out on the clock. I understand where the NHL is coming from in situations like these, but not every case is the same. Now and then, you bend a little. The Canadiens were in no condition to play or to entertain people paying major-league prices. Seems to me the fans already are getting an inferior product on too many nights. This one would have been worse than most - and a lot more dangerous. I am happy to hear, and I hope you are, too, that Calgary Flames defenceman Steve Smith has been urged by doctors to undergo career-ending spinal surgery. You'll remember that Smith lost feeling in his arms and legs in a freak collision with teammate Bobby Dollas, and announced that he had to take a long, hard look at whether or not he should continue playing - and wouldn't you know it, the last time I inquired about Smith, Calgary general manager Al Coates mentioned that the defenceman was working out. ""I really don't know whether or not he's coming back,"" Coates said, but it sounded as if the player seriously was considering returning to the lineup. I've got a bulletin for Smith: he's too good a guy to take chances with his life at this stage of his career. I'm starting to get the idea that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman is learning to say all of the right things at the right time. Bettman, as you know, was on a telephone conference call with the media shortly after federal Industry Minister John Manley announced that the deal to subsidize the NHL's six Canadian teams was as dead as an Islanders-Tampa Bay game. Bettman was on the telephone to express his concern over the bailout, and people in his high-profile position have been known to come out firing from the hip at times like these. Not my man, Gary. No sir. Instead: ""We have to step back and, on a club-by-club basis, reassess and see what we have to do to ensure each club's viable position,"" he said. ""The fact that the federal government has decided not to participate means I have to go back to the board with respect to Canadian assistance, even to have it continue for another year in its current form. I think government tried hard,"" he said. ""Minister Manley and Prime Minister Chretien tried to deal with the fairness issue in a suitable way."" Seems to me a similar message from the NHL Players' Association wouldn't be a bad idea just about now. Better something like that than hearing about the war chests both sides have built awaiting the end of the collective bargaining agreement in 2004, when it's expected no hockey will be played. How's this for reaching for the top? The Can-Am Sports Management Group, established by attorneys David Schatia and Allan Walsh, have merged their sports-management practice into AMG Sports. Normally, that wouldn't raise an eye. NHL ROUNDUP made 26 stops as the Senators lost back-to-back games for the first time since early December, and are 0-3-2 in the last nine days. With the fifth shutout of his rookie season, Biron broke a tie for the league lead with Calgary's Fred Brathwaite, St. Louis's Roman Turek and Ottawa's Ron Tugnutt, who was sidelined last night with the flu. Blues 3, Stars 1 At Dallas, Lubos Bartecko scored the go-ahead goal in the second period and Roman Turek stopped 19 shots against the Coyotes' No. 1 asset, has 21 goals and brow anywhere. The red light comes on, however, when you realize that Artists Management Group is headed by Michael Ovitz, who was once, and still might be, the most powerful agent in Hollywood. You've got to be at the top of the power list when you sell your talent agency, are hired by Disney as its No. 2 man, then walk away with a golden parachute worth many millions after working for Mickey Mouse for less than a year. Anyway, Ovitz is back in the business of representing people. His client list includes Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. One question: can they skate? Is it too early for me to send in my Hart Trophy vote for Pavel Bure? If he's not the most exciting as well as the most valuable player in the league, who is? I mean, who means more, who has done more to turn around his team than Bure? You might remember that the Florida Panthers didn't make the playoffs last season. Now, they're a lock to finish first in the Southeast Division, with the promise of going far in the playoffs. Here's a guy who missed eight games with an injury, yet has been on fire with almost a goal-a-game pace. Eight of his 35 goals in 41 games have been game-winners. Then, of course, it's not how many he scores, it's the way he scores 'em. You want exciting hockey: log on to Pavel. Jaromir Jagr will win the scoring title again, but it's hard to imagine anyone other than Bure emerging as the NHL's leading goal-scorer. Nobody is as quick, nobody scores as many big goals, nobody contributes as much to his team's success. The big question, of course, is whether or not he can remain healthy. He's missed most of two seasons with savage knee injuries, yet has scored 302 goals in 480 games. Face it, he sells tickets. You can't blame Tampa Bay Lightning for lifting St. Louis. Turek, the backup to Ed Belfour in the Stars' run to the Stanley Cup last season, is 2-0 against Dallas this season since being traded to the Blues. Red Wings 4, Flames 1 At Detroit, Nicklas Lidstrom and Pat Verbeek scored power play goals 26 seconds apart in the second period as the Red Wings beat Calgary. Igor Larionov added two assists for the Red Wings, who have won three straight after an 0-2 slide. Fred Brathwaite made 32 saves for the Flames. SAM MORRIS, AP 18 assists in 43 games this season. ning management for trying, can you? There were high hopes for the Lightning going into the season, but things have fallen apart to the point where they went into last night's game seeking only their second victory in their last 20 games. It's why the Lightning has hired Joe Sheridan, a former helicopter pilot in Vietnam, to fly into the players' heads in an attempt to make winners out of losers. Apparently, three years ago, Lightning coach Steve Ludzik brought Sheridan in to rally his Detroit Vipers after they had lost the first two games in the best-of-five International Hockey League playoffs. The Vipers won the next three. The following year, the Vipers won the ML championship. Sheridan told Tampa Bay reporters: ""If I can reach just six guys, and make a difference with them, then I've done well. And I also consider myself a coach to the coaches. All sports coaches are so wrapped in strategy and X's and O's and schedules and flights and practices and so on, that they sometimes forget or aren't trained for this part of the game. That's where I come in."" Why, I wonder, do coaches hire people to rally their players? I can think of a few coaches at the NHL level who could use a little help themselves. I can think of a few who no longer are in the NHL. AROUND THE NHL: You haven't traveled first class until you've hitched a ride on the Boeing 707 that carries the Rangers and New York Knicks to their games on the road. Almost makes you wish you were Stephane Quintal. You've got to like the invitation that reads: ""Hockey Great Mike Bossy invites you to the official opening of his new restaurant."" Mike might have mentioned once or twice he was a master at scoring goals, but I never knew the guy was also a master chef. Vancouver Canucks general manager Brian Burke was kidding, wasn't he, when he suggested on national television that all that was needed to fix the Lightning was a little bit of magic? Capitals 3, Coyotes 2 (OT) At Washington, Calle Johansson scored with less than a second left in overtime as the Capitals beat Phoenix to extend its unbeaten streak to 10 games. Hurricanes 4, Devils 3 (OT) At Raleigh, N.C., Jeff O'Neill scored 16 seconds into overtime to give Carolina a victory over New Jersey. Oilers 7, Lightning 3 In Tampa, Janne Niinimaa scored twice as Edmonton beat the Lightning. At Vancouver, the Canucks rolled over the San Jose Sharks 4-1. THEY SAID IT: ""They got three doing whatever they wanted to do,"" - Florida Panthers coach Terry Murray, on his team losing 4-2 in Philadelphia. ""I hope I can be a piece of the puzzle in Philadelphia, and I'll do the best I can to put them over the top,"" - Keith Primeau, on being acquired by the Philadelphia Flyers for Rod Brind'Amour. ""Hopefully, he'll be the piece of the puzzle to put us over the hump,"" - Carolina centreman Ron Francis, on the acquisition of Brind'Amour from Philadelphia for Primeau. ""It wasn't easy. I almost turned around halfway to the United Center and went back home to catch the game on the dish,"" - Former Chicago Blackhawks general manager Bob Murray, on his first scouting trip to the home of the team that fired him. ""In an age where you buy a house with no money down and people look for a pill that takes fat off, there are no quick fixes in hockey,"" - Tampa Bay coach Steve Ludzik, on staying with rookies despite his team's horrendous record.",1,20000129,modern,Freezing,0,0,0,0,0,0,
