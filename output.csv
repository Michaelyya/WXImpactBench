TOE PROVDMCE

Veteran

By EDDIE COLLISTER of The Gazette

Coroner Roch Heroux, the man charged with probing the baffling, controversial deaths of three men in 1989, is a veteran of more than 5,000 inquests who admits he's afraid of the dead and of dying. ""I never look at photographs of the corpses,"" Heroux said in a recent interview in his 18th-floor office in Complexe Desjardins' East Tower. ""When the photos are produced I pretend to view them for a few moments, then hand them over to the clerk to enter as exhibits. The testimony of witnesses is hard enough to take at times and I don't have to look at gory pictures to make my rulings."" Heroux is a former Crown prosecutor who has been a coroner since January 1973. Dr. Jean Grenier, Quebec's chief coroner, assigned Heroux the inquests into the deaths of Olympic gold medallist Victor Davis, 25, Quebec game warden Luc Guindon, 29, and F. Kingsley Doody, 81, after the Crown ruled there wasn't enough evidence to support criminal charges.

Likes lots of work

Heroux, a poet and former librarian, is looking forward to presiding over the inquests. ""I like it when I have lots of work,"" said the 66-year-old coroner, who is known for his emotional outbursts on the bench, especially when probing deaths of children. ""Children are so trusting, so naive,"" said the man who has no children of his own. ""It pains me when they die needlessly, especially when they're made to suffer beforehand."" Heroux said he didn't keep close tabs on press coverage of the three high-profile cases he's been assigned. ""I have to base my rulings on what witnesses tell me, so I don't pay much attention to what's said or written in the media. All I know is that there's a lot of interest in the cases, especially in the English-speaking community."" Davis died in hospital Nov. 13, a couple of days after he was struck by a car outside a Ste. Anne de Bellevue brasserie. Guindon, 29, one of this province's 450 game wardens, was killed in the woods near Ste. Agathe when a bolt from a crossbow, fired by an alleged poacher, pierced his heart. The inquiry into Guindon's death is set for Jan. 22-23 at St. Jerome. No dates have been set for the other inquests. Doody died Oct. 2 at the Montreal General Hospital. The retired insurance executive and veteran suffered rib and hip fractures in an Aug. 31 incident at the Hillside Tennis Club. Doody fell down stairs.

Two men die in highway accident as freezing rain makes roads icy

By TU THANH HA of The Gazette

Two motorists, including a Montreal man, were killed after freezing rain falling over the province on New Year's Eve left roads slippery with ice. Jimmy Patacki, 27, of Montreal died on Highway 10 near Granby when the car he was driving slammed into the side of a tow truck parked on the left westbound lane, police said. One passenger, Patrick Plourde, 60, of Bonneville, Alta., died in the afternoon at the Centre Hospitalier de Granby, said Sgt. Michel Gamache, a Sûreté du Quebec officer in Sherbrooke. Three other passengers were injured in the collision. The collision happened after 2 p.m. at a spot where eight cars had slid into ditches after drivers lost control on the ice. Following the accident, Highway 10 was closed briefly in both directions, Transport Quebec official Claude Laforest said. No major road accidents were reported yesterday, Sûreté Const. Robert Poeti said. Highways in Montreal were in good condition and the situation on Highway 10 was ""becoming normal,"" said Transport Quebec official Alain Legault. Sunday was the first time since Dec. 6 that temperatures were above zero, Steve McCusky of the Dorval weather office said. Sunday's recorded high at Dorval was 3 degrees Celsius and freezing rain turned to light rain by afternoon. Yesterday, the mercury dropped from -1 C in the morning to -8 C at 11 p.m. Today is expected to be sunny with winds of 15 to 30 kilometres per hour and a high of -3 C. In the Montreal area, at least 13,000 households were left without electricity Sunday when the freezing rain seeped into underground cables or short-circuited power lines on utility poles. About 6,000 Hydro-Quebec customers were blacked out on Montreal Island, mostly in Outremont, Anjou and east-end Montreal. On the South Shore, 4,000 Hydro customers, mostly in Brossard, St. Hubert and Greenfield Park, were affected. In Laval, about 3,000 Hydro users in the Chomedey and St. Francois districts lost power. In Pincourt, 200 households were also blacked out. The power failures were repaired by Sunday evening.

The contract, scheduled to begin in May, is for a minimum of 340 megawatts and the utilities have an option to buy another 110 megawatts. The Public Service Department endorsed only the first 340 megawatts. ""Before the additional capacity is required, it has to be shown that the need couldn't be satisfied by energy conservation programs,"" Dutton said. Brian Craik, an adviser to the Grand Council of the Cree, said he is still optimistic the Public Service Board will turn the contract down. Jim Higgins, a member of the New England Coalition for Energy Efficiency and the Environment, said the department did not consider all the evidence that the board will have to consider. ""The department was looking less at the environmental aspect and more at the economics,"" he said.

Thieves steal cash, drugs from RCMP detachment

VANCOUVER (CP) - RCMP in suburban Langley seem a little embarrassed about a recent break-in at their own detachment. Thieves made off with cash and drugs over the Christmas holidays. The Mounties were too busy elsewhere to notice, said Staff Sgt. Peter Obrowski. ""We had stabbings, impaired drivers, domestic disputes and every single available person was working,"" he said. The police kept details to a minimum. ""We had a break-in sometime between Dec. 22 and Dec. 27, and the thieves got away with some drugs and cash,"" said Insp. David Mortimer. Mortimer refused to say how they gained entry or how much they stole. ""The more we keep back the better for the investigation.""

Four dead in Ottawa-area nursing home fire

GLOUCESTER, Ont. (CP) - An Ontario fire marshal will order forensic tests today to determine the cause of a fire that killed four people yesterday in a home for the elderly. The four died after dense smoke poured through their rooms in the Rembrandt Manor in an Ottawa suburb. Nineteen more were saved from the 3 a.m. blaze which took firefighters only minutes to douse. Dr. James Dickson, the Ottawa coroner, believes all four died of smoke inhalation and will decide whether to hold an inquest once the fire's cause is known. Les McPhee, an Ontario fire marshal, said the fire appeared to start in a corridor near or inside a linen cupboard. He plans to order forensic tests today to determine the cause. The victims were Frederick Armstrong, 73, Laura Borges, 83, Elzear Guilbault, 61, and Freda Haddad, 90. Four residents were admitted to hospital, one in critical and three in fair condition. The other residents were taken to another home for the elderly where they will stay until the home can reopen. Stephanie Baraniak, one of the residence's six co-owners, said Judy Boucher, the only nurse on duty New Year's Eve, moved residents in areas away from the fire into the chapel in the north wing. ""But she hadn't been able to reach the residents where the fire was,"" Baraniak said. Baraniak said she and her husband arrived at the fire and firefighters began to remove the residents, many of them overcome by smoke. ""Then we reached one bedridden resident we were concerned about.""

What more can I say? Co-owner Jean Vinet said all residents were able to get around without assistance. But relatives said three of the dead had been unable to walk unassisted. Armstrong's legs had been amputated, and he had recently suffered a stroke. Haddad had been confined to a wheelchair for 10 years and Guilbault could only walk unattended at an extremely slow pace. Rembrandt Manor is a supervised residence for seniors. Unlike nursing homes, it is not licensed or regulated by the province, nor are any of its fees paid by any provincial healthcare program. The residents pay the entire fee, which ranges from $25 to $35 a day. Question staffing Carole Armstrong, daughter-in-law of one of the victims, said the family was unaware the home was unlicensed. However, she said her father-in-law seemed ""happy with the care."" Ray Guilbault, son of victim Elzear Guilbault, questioned having one staff person on duty. ""I think she (Boucher) did one super job under the circumstances, but if there had been more people maybe some lives could have been saved. It's very sad. Maybe these institutions should be scrutinized more carefully.""

Showman recalls life on the road

GLENBORO, Man. (CP) - In the days before television, the showman visited southern Manitoba's rural schools and churches not only to thread National Film Board productions but to let viewers debate them. Gerry McLeod, 79, was among a handful of travelling projectionists on the Prairies from 1939 to the 1950s who were commonly known as showmen. ""The guys who were in it, were in a sense, evangelists,"" he said at his home in this rural community 170 kilometres west of Winnipeg. ""Not in the religious sense but with a message to build a better Canada,"" McLeod said. ""We were prepared to work long hours to get this across."" McLeod joined the National Film Board, which celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, in 1946 after he served with the signal corps in the Second World War. He travelled Prairie roads during harsh winters and dusty summers in a second-hand Chevy, and by the late 1940s was visiting 55 schools. ""It's all very well to make films but you had to have some system of getting the films to the people, and that's what led to the travelling projectionist,"" he said. Part of McLeod's duties was also to stimulate discussion after each visit. Although television ended the days of the travelling showmen, McLeod stayed with the NFB until his retirement in 1973. He devoted much of his time setting up local film clubs in school libraries. The film distribution system garnered a worldwide reputation as government officials from China and India attempted a similar process.]"
19900103,"[Y And his fight against Benn had already been postponed to later this month because of a kitchen accident two weeks ago which left a small gash on his right hand. ""I've paid my dues,"" said Olajide, who announced himself fit and ready to resume full training next week. ""This is a good opportunity for me and I'm going to put everything on the line in this fight."" 

Even ice fishermen chilled by winter. Though the weatherman had promised warmer temperatures, even Saturday's sunshine failed to prod the mercury up enough to herald the start of the warming trend. It was cold out on the ice of Montreal-area waters, bitterly cold, and when darkness closed in, it grew colder yet. Few anglers ventured out to face a wind-chill capable of freezing skin in just minutes; those who did were able to endure the elements just long enough to set up their rigs, but once the warmth from the exercise had dissipated, the full measure of the cold hit home. Even baiting the hooks was a painful procedure. 

But on the Riviere des Prairies, the walleye seem unaware of the bitter cold above the surface; they're still hitting as well as they were all December long. ""And that's a lot better than I've seen in more than two decades of winter walleye fishing."" Tip-ups baited with four-inch shiners on number four hooks are consistently effective, but last weekend jigging produced a fair share of walleye as well as a number of hefty perch, most of them females already starting to swell, three months away from their spawning season. My terminal tackle consisted of a 1½-inch action tube black head and yellow skirt on an unpainted, 1/32-ounce jig head; above that I tied in a dropper line and an artificial ice-fishing grub. The terminal line was three-pound test monofilament. 

""I've always had the best success on the ice grubs, but last Saturday both the perch and walleye showed OUTDOORS George Gruenefeld a definite preference for action tubes."" It may have simply been a function of color, but the thought of snipping off one ice-fishing grub and then trying to tie an improved clinch knot on another in the numbing cold chilled any temptation to experiment. If the fish were willing to take at least one of my offerings, that was plenty good enough. 

One purpose for enduring last Saturday's cold was to test a new type of monofilament under the most adverse possible conditions and you couldn't get more adverse than last Saturday south of the sub-Arctic. Most monofilament lines pick up beads of ice as they are raised and lowered; and if these beads are not constantly removed, they quickly grow into a sheath of ice in the same way as a candlemaker creates hand-dipped tapers by dipping the wick in and out of molten wax. For some reason, black graphite monofilament seems to resist this tendency for ice to bead on the line and, even when it does, the few minute particles can be easily removed by simply running it between gloved thumb and fingers. 

Neither the manufacturer Tortue of France nor the Canadian distributor are apparently aware of the line's ice-repelling property. I spooled my ice fishing reel, an ultralight spinning reel with five-pound test, though six or eight-pound test might have worked just as well since I use a three-foot terminal leader of clear monofilament. Two years ago, the Montreal office of the provincial fish and game department started a perch tagging program on Lake St. Louis to learn something about the population dynamics of these popular game fish. Since that time, a total of 20,000 fish have been adorned with the blue plastic tags. 

Unfortunately, surprisingly few of the tags—only 470 of them in two seasons—have been returned to the department, either because the tagged fish have learned to be suspicious of man's activities or because anglers have become suspicious of the department's activities. In hopes of getting a better response this winter, the department has issued a reminder to anglers on Lake St. Louis that when they catch a tagged perch, they should put the tag in an envelope and send it to the Department of Recreation, Hunting and Fishing, Wildlife Management and Exploitation Service, 6255 13th Avenue, Montreal, Quebec H1X 3E6. 

In return for their trouble, the department promises them a brochure (in French), a certificate of recognition (in French), an arm patch (in French), and an O'Keefe cap (not necessarily in French). Anglers who fished for Atlantic salmon on the York and Dartmouth Rivers at the tip of Quebec's Gaspe Peninsula last season should check their mail carefully these days because, among the bills, they'll likely find an envelope from the Societe de gestion des rivieres York et Dartmouth, the organization which manages these two streams. 

The envelope contains a handful of entry blanks to take part in the drawing for prime salmon fishing beats this coming summer. Though only five forms are sent by the association to keep costs down in the general mailing, additional application blanks are available by contacting the association. Any number of entry forms can be submitted by any one person, but there is a nonrefundable fee of $4 for each entry. Sending in several dozen completed cards can get expensive and, while the odds of being drawn are improved as the number of cards sent increases, submitting a whole stack of entry forms is no guarantee of getting decent water. Bear in mind that any one angler can reserve no more than three days of fishing between the two rivers. 

Deadline for entries is Feb. 15 and the drawing takes place on Feb. 17 at the ZEC office in Gaspe. The 250 successful applicants are called in the order that they are drawn; in other words, the first name drawn has first choice. Anglers who need more entry blanks or have not received the forms for the drawing can call the ZEC York-Dartmouth at (418) 368-2324 or write to the Societe de gestion des rivieres York et Dartmouth.]"

For nearly a month now since Marc Lepine shot 14 women dead at Ecole Polytechnique, telegrams, letters and poems from mourners have been collected on four walls near a sixth-floor student lounge. Yesterday, the final flowers and photos of the victims were added to complete the memorial at the engineering school which will open officially tomorrow at 5 p.m. With the skies darkening outside the bay windows, a few students passed briefly by the display, taking a break from studying for their exams which were delayed until January because of the massacre. Among the tables covered with scores of condolence cards, the portrait photos of the victims were placed in glass displays. ""The first week after, no one felt like studying. It was hard to get yourself into that,"" said Louise Boudreault, a first-year student preparing nearby for her chemistry exam. The closeness students felt toward each other after the shooting may fade as academic worries return, one doctoral student said. ""Like any other grief, you have to get over it,"" he said. The doctoral student said he still wonders whether students could have done something to stop the gunman. Simon Hamel, a third-year electrical engineering student, also wondered if things could have been different. Hamel who, on Dec. 6, helped others.

Icy sidewalks are blamed for rash of injuries!

An increasing number of elderly people are being treated for injuries following tumbles on icy sidewalks, local hospital officials said yesterday. And the changing weather conditions are being blamed by the city of Montreal's public works for the slippery situation. ""The city is trying to give better service but it's almost nullified because the sand is washed away by rain, then it gets colder and it freezes again,"" said Diane Leduc, a public works official. Since Jan. 1, many patients, most of them elderly, have been treated at the Jewish General Hospital for hip or wrist fractures and sprains related to the icy conditions, said Dr. Marc Afilalo, director of the emergency ward. ""We don't keep a tally but from our experience it's really enormous,"" he said. ""It's really incredible the number of fractures we've seen."" Between the evening of Dec. 31, the day freezing rain started, and the morning of Jan. 2, about 10 patients were treated for injuries from falls, Afilalo said. Normally, the Jewish General treats two or three such patients in a week, he said. At the Montreal General there was a 10-per-cent increase in injuries from falls on ice, said Dr. Michael Churchill-Smith, head of emergency-room medical services. ""But we expect that when we see weather like this,"" he said. Higher numbers were also reported at the Lakeshore General Hospital and the Royal Victoria Hospital. Today, freezing rain is again forecast for the afternoon, with an expected high of 2 degrees Celsius. 

How to prevent injuries? Slow down when it's icy or dark, Afilalo said. ""And for older people, limit their going out.""

Bell struggling to repair underwater phone lines

About 1,200 Bell Canada subscribers in Laval's Ste. Dorothee district begin a second week without regular service today. A repair crew managed yesterday to anchor a barge into position on Riviere des Prairies near an underwater cable that failed a week ago today. But they were unable to lift the cable before dark, said Jean-Claude Hamel, an information officer for the utility. Bell has also beefed up temporary service to the area. A truck equipped to make free calls has been parked at Jolicoeur and Bord de l'Eau Sts, closer to many of the affected residents than 16 free public phones made available last Saturday near Ste. Dorothee Roman Catholic church.

Slain woman identified

The woman found bludgeoned to death in her apartment on 1st Ave. in Pointe aux Trembles Tuesday was identified yesterday as Jacqueline Bernard, 50. The detective in charge of the case, Lieut. Claude Lachapelle, said Montreal Urban Community police were exploring several leads yesterday but had no further details about the city's first slaying of 1990. No murder weapon had been found. On Tuesday police said Bernard's head had been bashed in with a blunt object. An autopsy was being performed yesterday but results were not available.

Last evening, the executive committee of the 2.3-million member labor federation was meeting in Toronto behind closed doors, and the labor barons were expected to tell president Shirley Carr that her time is almost up Carr was elected by acclamation in 1986 and re-elected at the last CLC convention in Vancouver in 1988 The next convention will be held in May Carr, according to press reports, was recently told she would be better not to run again by Robert White, head of the 162,000-member Canadian Automobile Workers There is discontent near the top, and Carr is being blamed for incompetence Her performance at the New Democratic Party convention in Winnipeg last month left just about everyone dissatisfied Supporters of Audrey McLaughlin faulted the labor leader for coming out in favor of David Barrett just before the last ballot Supporters of Barrett criticized her for waiting so long She announced her support when it was too late to help Barrett, but it put her at odds with the new leader of the federal NDP, which the CLC officially supports Others fault Carr for being on bad terms with the Progressive Conservative government, and with Brian Mulroney in particular Carr's term has coincided with the CLC's virulent anti-free trade campaign The governing party, in the 1988 election and since, has seen the CLC leadership as an intractable opposition to be neutralized rather than a partner to be placated Under the previous leader, Dennis McDermott, relations with the CLC were so good that Mulroney appointed McDermott as Canadian ambassador to Ireland when he stepped down from heading the CLC Other problems are also blamed on Carr The CLC is in debt and, as a money-saving measure, last year gave early retirement to 26 people on its staff of about 150 But after doing that at great expense, the CLC has since hired as many new people as it retired Some think the CLC leadership shows confusion One thing is certain: The CLC has not succeeded in providing a unified voice for Canadian labor, nor is it looked to by government as the authentic and authoritative voice of labor It does not seem to have much influence as a lobby even on its own members, at least to judge by labor's vote Election after election, the CLC has supported the NDP But most union members have continued to vote for either the Liberals or the Tories The CLC delivers money and a cadre of organizers It can't deliver the vote I write from the perspective of someone who believes in unions I am a union member myself, by free choice though my job does not demand it, and I gladly pay substantial dues for the privilege In 1988 I attended the CLC convention to form an idea of the quality of discussion and analysis displayed there It was a disillusioning experience Went to the microphone That convention centred on the then-imminent free-trade agreement Speaker after speaker went to the microphone to express an opinion There was only one opinion It was recited with the monotony of robots repeating a recorded announcement The fact accepted by all economists is that a free-trade agreement benefits some industries, hurts others Where there can be honest and intelligent disagreement is on the net effect: whether the advantages outweigh the drawbacks or vice versa, and whether the impacts, good and bad, are great or small But at the CLC, there was no room for measured analysis, only for dogma Hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost, period The free-trade agreement was bad, all bad, bad for everybody, and very, very bad Just as power corrupts, so does the lack of power and of responsibility The CLC, tied to a political party that never exercises power, shares much of its ivory tower dogmatism It is also fragmented by the north-south axis of the International unions, and by the true locus of decision-making in the member unions and in provincial governments The CLC and the federal NDP infect each other with their respective weaknesses, and neither has a workable policy for creating wealth, for working as senior partners in a tripartite relationship for the better production of goods and services The problems of the CLC are serious and will not be resolved by changing president]"
