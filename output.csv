"19900102","A-4 Cb?cttc, Montreal, Tuesday, January 2, 1990 THE GAZETTE Veteran By EDDIE COLLISTER of The Gazette Coroner Roch Heroux, the man charged with probing the baffling, controversial deaths of three men in 1989, is a veteran of more than 5,000 inquests who admits he's afraid of the dead and of dying. ""I never look at photographs of the corpses,"" Heroux said in a recent interview in his 18th-floor office in Complexe Desjardins East Tower. ""When the photos are produced I pretend to view them for a few moments, then hand them over to the clerk to enter as exhibits. The testimony of witnesses is hard enough to take at times and I don't have to look at gory pictures to make my rulings."" Heroux is a former Crown prosecutor who has been a coroner since January 1973. Dr. Jean Grenier, Quebec's chief coroner, assigned Heroux the inquests into the deaths of Olympic gold medallist Victor Davis, 25, Quebec game warden Luc Guindon, 29, and F. Kingsley Doody, 81, after the Crown ruled there wasn't enough evidence to support criminal charges. Likes lots of work Heroux, a poet and former librarian, is looking forward to presiding over the inquests. ""I like it when I have lots of work,"" said the 66-year-old coroner, who is known for his emotional outbursts on the bench, especially when probing deaths of children. ""Children are so trusting, so naive,"" said the man who has no children of his own. ""It pains me when they die needlessly, especially when they're made to suffer beforehand."" Heroux said he didn't keep close tabs on press coverage of the three high-profile cases he's been assigned. ""I have to base my rulings on what witnesses tell me, so I don't pay much attention to what's said or written in the media. All I know is that there's a lot of interest in the cases, especially in the English-speaking community."" Davis died in hospital Nov. 13, a couple of days after he was struck by a car outside a Ste. Anne de Bellevue brasserie. Guindon, 29, one of this province's 450 game wardens, was killed in the woods near Ste. Agathe when a bolt from a crossbow, fired by an alleged poacher, pierced his heart. The inquiry into Guindon's death is set for Jan. 22-23 at St. Jerome. No dates have been set for the other inquests. Doody died Oct. 2 at the Montreal General Hospital. The retired insurance executive and veteran suffered rib and hip fractures in an Aug. 31 incident at the Hillside Tennis Club. Doody fell down stairs. Two men die in highway accident as freezing rain makes roads icy By TU THANH HA of The Gazette Two motorists, including a Montreal man, were killed after freezing rain falling over the province on New Year's Eve left roads slippery with ice. Jimmy Patacki, 27, of Montreal died on Highway 10 near Granby when the car he was driving slammed into the side of a tow truck parked on the left westbound lane, police said. One passenger, Patrick Plourde, 60, of Bonneville, Alta., died in the afternoon at the Centre Hospitalier de Granby, said Sgt. Michel Gamache, a Sûreté du Quebec officer in Sherbrooke. Three other passengers were injured in the collision. The collision happened after 2 p.m. at a spot where eight cars had slid into ditches after drivers lost control on the ice. Following the accident, Highway 10 was closed briefly in both directions, Transport Quebec official Claude Laforest said. No major road accidents were reported yesterday, Sûreté Const. Robert Poeti said. Highways in Montreal were in good condition and the situation on Highway 10 was ""becoming normal,"" said Transport Quebec official Alain Legault. Sunday was the first time since Dec. 6 that temperatures were above zero, Steve McCusky of the Dorval weather office said. Sunday's recorded high at Dorval was 3 degrees Celsius and freezing rain turned to light rain by afternoon. Yesterday, the mercury dropped from -1 C in the morning to -8 C at 11 p.m. Today is expected to be sunny with winds of 15 to 30 kilometres per hour and a high of -3 C. In the Montreal area, at least 13,000 households were left without electricity Sunday when the freezing rain seeped into underground cables or short-circuited power lines on utility poles. About 6,000 Hydro-Quebec customers were blacked out on Montreal Island, mostly in Outremont, Anjou and east-end Montreal. On the South Shore, 4,000 Hydro customers, mostly in Brossard, St. Hubert and Greenfield Park, were affected. In Laval, about 3,000 Hydro users in the Chomedey and St. Francois districts lost power. In Pincourt, 200 households were also blacked out. The power failures were repaired by Sunday evening. The contract, scheduled to begin in May, is for a minimum of 340 megawatts and the utilities have an option to buy another 110 megawatts. The Public Service Department endorsed only the first 340 megawatts. ""Before the additional capacity is required, it has to be shown that the need couldn't be satisfied by energy conservation programs,"" Dutton said. Brian Craik, an adviser to the Grand Council of the Cree, said he is still optimistic the Public Service Board will turn the contract down. Jim Higgins, a member of the New England Coalition for Energy Efficiency and the Environment, said the department did not consider all the evidence that the board will have to consider. ""The department was looking less at the environmental aspect and more at the economics,"" he said. The police probe into the suspected assault was stymied by club members who closed ranks to protect their member and the club's reputation. Club members who agreed to talk with authorities generally arrived at the interview with their legal advisers in tow. ""Montreal defence lawyer Raphael Schachter will be a key figure in two of the three pending hearings. Schachter represents the man he himself describes as ""the prime suspect"" in the Doody affair. He has advised his client of his right to remain silent and has blocked two attempts by police to question the man. Schachter challenged detectives to lay charges, telling them he was ready to defend the man in court. Schachter said he intends to take legal steps to stop Heroux from putting his client, a man in the tennis club locker room the night Doody was hurt, in the witness box. In the Davis case, Schachter will be representing the dead swimmer's family and two eyewitnesses to the incident including Donna Clavel, Davis's girlfriend. Because of 1986 changes to the Coroner's Act, Quebec coroners cannot establish criminal responsibility. Their new mandate is to probe the circumstances of a death to establish whether anything can be done to avert a recurrence. Heroux, a member of the Montreal bar since 1956, is still em to -8 C at 11 p.m. Today is expected to be sunny with winds of 15 to 30 kilometres per hour and a high of -3 C.

Thieves steal cash, drugs from RCMP detachment VANCOUVER (CP) - RCMP in suburban Langley seem a little embarrassed about a recent break-in at their own detachment. Thieves made off with cash and drugs over the Christmas holidays. The Mounties were too busy elsewhere to notice, said Staff Sgt. Peter Obrowski. ""We had stabbings, impaired drivers, domestic disputes and every single available person was working,"" he said. The police kept details to a minimum. ""We had a break-in sometime between Dec. 22 and Dec. 27, and the thieves got away with some drugs and cash,"" said Insp. David Mortimer. Mortimer refused to say how they gained entry or how much they stole. ""The more we keep back the better for the investigation."" Four dead in Ottawa-area nursing home GLOUCESTER, Ont. (CP) - An Ontario fire marshal will order forensic tests today to determine the cause of a fire that killed four people yesterday in a home for the elderly. The four died after dense smoke poured through their rooms in the Rembrandt Manor in an Ottawa suburb. Nineteen more were saved from the 3 a.m. blaze which took firefighters only minutes to douse. Dr. James Dickson, the Ottawa coroner, believes all four died of smoke inhalation and will decide whether to hold an inquest once the fire's cause is known. Les McPhee, an Ontario fire marshal, said the fire appeared to start in a corridor near or inside a linen cupboard. He plans to order forensic tests today to determine the cause. The victims were Frederick Armstrong, 73, Laura Borges, 83, Elzear Guilbault, 61, and Freda Haddad, 90. Four residents were admitted to hospital, one in critical and three in fair condition. The other residents were taken to another home for the elderly where they will stay until the home can reopen. Stephanie Baraniak, one of the residence's six co-owners, said Judy Boucher, the only nurse on duty New Year's Eve, moved residents in areas away from the fire into the chapel in the north wing. ""But she hadn't been able to reach the residents where the fire was,"" Baraniak said. Baraniak said she and her husband arrived at the fire and firefighters began to remove the residents, many of them overcome by smoke. ""Then we reached one bedridden resident we were concerned about. Worker tosses snow on some smouldering debris outside nursing home yesterday. He was burned on his head and hand. There were 12 people in the burning south wing. ""They were all trapped in their rooms in the fire area. We could very well have had 12 people dead,"" said Gloucester platoon chief Mike Stackpole. ""In my 20 years I've never seen anything like it. To come up to a building and there's people trapped in it and not one person is outside. What more can I say?"" Co-owner Jean Vinet said all residents were able to get around without assistance. But relatives said three of the dead had been unable to walk unassisted. Armstrong's legs had been amputated, and he had recently suffered a stroke. Haddad had been confined to a wheelchair for 10 years and Guilbault could only walk unattended at an extremely slow pace. Rembrandt Manor is a supervised residence for seniors. Unlike nursing homes, it is not licensed or regulated by the province, nor are any of its fees paid by any provincial healthcare program. The residents pay the entire fee, which ranges from $25 to $35 a day. Question staffing Carole Armstrong, daughter-in-law of one of the victims, said the family was unaware the home was unlicensed. However, she said her father-in-law seemed ""happy with the care."" Ray Guilbault, son of victim Elzear Guilbault, questioned having one staff person on duty. ""I think she (Boucher) did one super job under the circumstances, but if there had been more people maybe some lives could have been saved. It's very sad. Maybe these institutions should be scrutinized more carefully."" Showman recalls life on road GLENBORO, Man. (CP) - In the days before television, the showman visited southern Manitoba's rural schools and churches not only to thread National Film Board productions but to let viewers debate them. Gerry McLeod, 79, was among a handful of travelling projectionists on the Prairies from 1939 to the 1950s who were commonly known as showmen. ""The guys who were in it, were in a sense, evangelists,"" he said at his home in this rural community 170 kilometres west of Winnipeg. ""Not in the religious sense but with a message to build a better Canada,"" McLeod said. ""We were prepared to work long hours to get this across."" McLeod joined the National Film Board, which celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, in 1946 after he served with the signal corps in the Second World War. He travelled Prairie roads during harsh winter and dusty summers in a second-hand Chevy, and by the late 1940s was visiting 55 schools. ""It's all very well to make films but you had to have some system of getting the films to the people, and that's what led to the travelling projectionist,"" he said. Part of McLeod's duties was also to stimulate discussion after each visit. Although television ended the days of the travelling showmen, McLeod stayed with the NFB until his retirement in 1973. He devoted much of his time setting up local film clubs in school libraries. The film distribution system garnered a worldwide reputation as government officials from China and India attempted a similar process."
"19900103","And his fight against Benn had already been postponed to later this month because of a kitchen accident two weeks ago which left a small gash on his right hand. ""I've paid my dues,"" said Olajide, who announced himself fit and ready to resume full training next week. ""This is a good opportunity for me and I'm going to put everything on the line in this fight."" Even ice fishermen chilled by winter. Though the weatherman had promised warmer temperatures, even Saturday's sunshine failed to prod the mercury up enough to herald the start of the warming trend. It was cold out on the ice of Montreal-area waters, bitterly cold, and when darkness closed in, it grew colder yet. Few anglers ventured out to face a wind-chill capable of freezing skin in just minutes; those who did were able to endure the elements just long enough to set up their rigs, but once the warmth from the exercise had dissipated, the full measure of the cold hit home. Even baiting the hooks was a painful procedure. But on the Riviere des Prairies, the walleye seem unaware of the bitter cold above the surface; they're still hitting as well as they were all December long. ""And that's a lot better than I've seen in more than two decades of winter walleye fishing."" Tip-ups baited with four-inch shiners on number four hooks are consistently effective, but last weekend jigging produced a fair share of walleye as well as a number of hefty perch, most of them females already starting to swell, three months away from their spawning season. My terminal tackle consisted of a 1½-inch action tube black head and yellow skirt on an unpainted, 1/32-ounce jig head; above that I tied in a dropper line and an artificial ice-fishing grub. The terminal line was three-pound test monofilament. ""I've always had the best success on the ice grubs, but last Saturday both the perch and walleye showed a definite preference for action tubes."" It may have simply been a function of color, but the thought of snipping off one ice-fishing grub and then trying to tie an improved clinch knot on another in the numbing cold chilled any temptation to experiment. If the fish were willing to take at least one of my offerings, that was plenty good enough. ""One purpose for enduring last Saturday's cold was to test a new type of monofilament under the most adverse possible conditions and you couldn't get more adverse than last Saturday south of the sub-Arctic."" Most monofilament lines pick up beads of ice as they are raised and lowered; and if these beads are not constantly removed, they quickly grow into a sheath of ice in the same way as a candlemaker creates hand-dipped tapers by dipping the wick in and out of molten wax. For some reason, black graphite monofilament seems to resist this tendency for ice to bead on the line and, even when it does, the few minute particles can be easily removed by simply running it between gloved thumb and fingers. ""Neither the manufacturer Tortue of France nor the Canadian distributor are apparently aware of the line's ice-repelling property."" I spooled my ice fishing reel, an ultralight spinning reel with five-pound test, though six or eight-pound test might have worked just as well since I use a three-foot terminal leader of clear monofilament. Two years ago, the Montreal office of the provincial fish and game department started a perch tagging program on Lake St. Louis to learn something about the population dynamics of these popular game fish. Since that time, a total of 20,000 fish have been adorned with the blue plastic tags. ""Unfortunately, surprisingly few of the tags, only 470 of them in two seasons, have been returned to the department, either because the tagged fish have learned to be suspicious of man's activities or because anglers have become suspicious of the department's activities."" In hopes of getting a better response this winter, the department has issued a reminder to anglers on Lake St. Louis that when they catch a tagged perch, they should put the tag in an envelope and send it to the Department of Recreation, Hunting and Fishing, Wildlife Management and Exploitation Service, 6255 13th Avenue, Montreal, Quebec H1X 3E6. ""In return for their trouble, the department promises them a brochure (in French), a certificate of recognition (in French), an arm patch (in French), and an O'Keefe cap (not necessarily in French)."" Anglers who fished for Atlantic salmon on the York and Dartmouth Rivers at the tip of Quebec's Gaspe Peninsula last season should check their mail carefully these days because, among the bills, they'll likely find an envelope from the Societe de gestion des rivieres York et Dartmouth, the organization which manages these two streams. The envelope contains a handful of entry blanks to take part in the drawing for prime salmon fishing beats this coming summer. Though only five forms are sent by the association to keep costs down in the general mailing, additional application blanks are available by contacting the association. Any number of entry forms can be submitted by any one person, but there is a nonrefundable fee of $4 for each entry. Sending in several dozen completed cards can get expensive and, while the odds of being drawn are improved as the number of cards sent increases, submitting a whole slack of entry forms is no guarantee of getting decent water. Bear in mind that any one angler can reserve no more than three days of fishing between the two rivers. Deadline for entries is Feb. 15 and the drawing takes place on Feb. 17 at the ZEC office in Gaspe. The 250 successful applicants are called in the order that they are drawn; in other words, the first name drawn has first choice. Anglers who need more entry blanks or have not received the forms for the drawing can call the ZEC York-Dartmouth at (418) 368-2324 or write to the Societe de gestion des rivieres York et Dartmouth."
